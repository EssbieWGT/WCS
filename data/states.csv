(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court sided Friday with a woman who lost a job offer when she refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, rejecting the employer’s arguments that federal law supersedes a state law restriction on questioning the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Katlin Keeran, an occupational therapist who lived in Johnson County, initially cited concerns about the use of fetal cells in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. But under questioning by Powerback Rehabilitation, she said she had previously gotten the flu vaccine but didn’t want to get the COVID-19 vaccine because “I am not familiar with it.” The company rescinded its employment offer.
Keeran filed a complaint with the Kansas Department of Labor, saying the company violated a law passed by the Legislature during a 2021 special session that allowed individuals to opt out of a federal vaccine mandate and made it illegal for employers to question the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Because Powerback receives Medicare and Medicaid funding, it was subject to the vaccine mandate as a condition for receiving those dollars. Federal law empowers employers to question the sincerity of a religious belief.
Powerback argued it was impossible to comply with both federal and state laws, and that federal law should prevail.
Justice Caleb Stegall, who was appointed by Gov. Sam Brownback, wrote the opinion for a 4-2 majority. He said the company’s argument was “simple and alluring at first blush” but “incorporates a deft sleight-of-hand.”
Federal law allows, but doesn’t require, an inquiry, Stegall wrote, and the state has an interest in preserving religious liberty.
“Prohibiting an inquiry by an employer into the sincerity of a religious belief is clearly rationally related to protecting cherished liberty interests,” Stegall wrote.
The court reversed a Johnson County District Court ruling that found the state law unconstitutional.
Justice Melissa Standridge, who was appointed by Gov. Laura Kelly, wrote a dissent that was joined by Justice Eric Rosen, who was appointed  by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
Standridge wrote that Kansas law “stands as an obstacle” to federal objectives. An employer should be justified, she wrote, in seeking supporting information about an prospective employee’s religious accommodation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4F5A1686-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

The FBI is also hoping to mine tips from the public as it continues its investigation into the incident in which authorities say the suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, also set the building ablaze before being shot and killed by law enforcement.
A total of 12 people were shot in the attack, police said, with five fatalities, including the alleged shooter.
It’s unclear exactly why Sanford chose the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the target for his attack.

On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all U.S. and Michigan flags on all public and state government buildings to be lowered to half-staff to honor the victims through Friday.
Whitmer, in a statement, said her heart is breaking for the community known commonly as the Mormon church.
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. To honor those we have lost, I am ordering flags to be lowered across Michigan. Our state is in mourning alongside the victims, their families, and the entire community in Grand Blanc Township.”
Whitmer also spoke at press conference Monday afternoon in Grand Blanc Township.
“I know that this community is reeling right now, and I want you to know that the state of Michigan has your back. You’re grief is our grief,” Whitmer said. “There’s one thing I know about Michigan is that we get through hard things together, and that’s who we are.”

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, a candidate for the governor’s office in 2026, said he was also devastated by the shooting.
“Such a horrific act of violence – towards anyone, anywhere – is unjustified,” Gilchrist said. “I’m grateful to the local police officers, fire, and EMS for their quick response. Let’s keep holding each other close.”
State Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), whose district covers Grand Blanc in Genesee County, called the incident a “cowardly attack” on the community.
“On a Sunday, in a sacred house of worship, families should feel nothing but peace and safety. That was stolen from them today in the most horrific and evil way,” Martin said. “My heart breaks for the victims, their families, and everyone in the community who has been shaken by this senseless violence.”
Martin also thanked what he said was a swift and “courageous” response from local law enforcement, as well as an officer from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, who responded in addition to emergency medical personnel.
State Sen. John Cherry (D-Flint), who represents a large portion of Genesee County, including Grand Blanc, said the incident was a tragic act of violence.
“To terrorize people in a place of worship, where their hopes are highest and their faith strongest, is particularly sickening and has rocked our entire community,” Cherry said in a statement. “The congregation, the people of Grand Blanc, and our Genesee County community as a whole will need to heal and rebuild emotionally and physically, and I hope we can all come together to support them and one another during these trying and terrifying times.”
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said she was praying for the Mormon community, the victims’ and their families, calling violence in a place of worship “despicable.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) was quick to offer her support and prayers for the Grand Blanc and Mormon community, while also pushing the brake pedal on snap judgments regarding the shooter’s motives, which remain unknown.
“We will know more in the coming days and weeks. And there will be more to say,” Slotkin said in a statement. “But today, we send our strength to those involved who must now try and pick up the pieces and grieve.”
Little is known about Sanford and why he chose the Mormon church as a target for his attack. The FBI Detroit Field Office on late Sunday evening used social media to request any person with information that could assist the investigation to call its tip line or visit its online tip exchange.

What is known is that Sanford was a Burton resident who fought in the Iraq War, and the license plate of his truck, which officials say he used to ram into the building before opening fire on congregants, indicated that he was a veteran of the Iraq War.
Bridge Michigan reported that Google Maps images of Sanford’s home address in Burton, captured in June of this year, show that he had a campaign sign for President Donald Trump affixed to a fence surrounding the small brick house. Bridge also reported that records show Sanford signed two recent ballot proposal petitions.
The first was for the Unlock Michigan proposal that sought to repeal Michigan’s statutory allowance for sweeping gubernatorial powers during a state of emergency, which was wielded by Whitmer in the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other was supporting Right to Life Michigan’s attempt to keep the state’s abortion ban in place after the fall of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights and access to reproductive health care nationwide.
Other reports have noted that his son had a rare pancreatic disease.

(Hughes campaign photo)Missy Hughes, Wisconsin’s former top economic development official, announced her campaign for governor Monday, positioning herself as an effective non-politician with a strong economic track record.
Hughes served as Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) CEO and secretary from Oct. 1, 2019, until this past Sept. 19. She becomes the seventh Democrat to join the field for the party’s nomination after Gov. Tony Evers announced in July that he will not seek a third term in 2026.
“Listen, I’m not a politician. I’m different than other folks you’ve seen run for governor. That’s the point,” Hughes says in her launch video released Monday morning.
An executive for 17 years at Organic Valley before Evers appointed her to lead the WEDC, Hughes says in the video that the cooperative, which markets organic dairy products sourced from more than 1,800 farms across the U.S., topped $1 billion in revenue during her tenure.
At the WEDC, Hughes headed Wisconsin’s negotiations with major employers expanding their operations or relocating to the state. During her tenure, “major companies like Milwaukee Tool, Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Kikkoman and more committed to invest over $10 billion and create 45,000 good-paying jobs across Wisconsin,” the Hughes campaign stated in a debut email.
Hughes also raised the department’s profile in small business and local community economic development. The WEDC oversaw many of the state’s COVID-19 relief programs, which focused heavily on small business recovery from the short but sharp economic hit brought on by the pandemic.
Among the highest profile efforts was the Main Street Bounceback, which directed $10,000 grants to more than 9,500 small businesses across Wisconsin.
The WEDC is also the lead state agency involved in Wisconsin’s successful application for federal support to establish a technology hub centered on the state’s biohealth sector.
Hughes’ launch video pitches her campaign as focused on the economy but also nods to issues of personal freedom that have been part of Democrats’ messaging ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“As governor, I’ll create a Main Street economy that includes you, and works for you,” Hughes says in the video. “Where we strengthen our Main Streets, make sure Wisconsinites have higher wages and housing they can afford, our families have child care and health care that doesn’t break the bank, and our public schools prepare our kids for the future.”
Over shots of the White House and then a gleaming urban office tower, she adds, “I’m not going to go looking for a fight, but I’ll stand up to anyone, from the White House to Wall Street, who comes after your rights or tries to make your life harder.”
Hughes is the second Democrat with an Evers administration background to seek the party’s nomination in the August 2026 primary. Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first to enter the race, declaring her candidacy less than 24 hours after Evers announced he was not running.
Other declared hopefuls are Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison). Milwaukee factory worker and baseball stadium beer vendor Ryan Strnad and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey are also seeking the nomination.

A Mississippi infant recently died from pertussis, or whooping cough, the State Department of Health announced Monday. 
It is the first whooping cough death reported in Mississippi since 2012 and the third since 2008. 
Whooping cough cases in Mississippi are the highest they have been in at least a decade.
The infant was not eligible to be vaccinated against the disease due to his or her age, the agency said in a statement. 
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney has repeatedly said that vaccines are the best defense against diseases like pertussis.
Because infants are not eligible for the pertussis vaccination until they are two months old, the health department recommends that pregnant women, grandparents and family or friends who may come in close contact with an infant get booster shots to ensure they do not pass the illness to children.
This year, 115 pertussis cases have been reported to the health department, compared to 49 total last year. 
Over 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported across the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The highly contagious respiratory illness is named for the “whooping” sound people make when gasping for air after a coughing fit. It may begin like a common cold but can last for weeks or months and make it difficult to breathe. Babies younger than 1 year are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough, and can have severe complications that often require hospitalization. 
Mississippi for many years had the highest child vaccination rates in the nation. But rates have fallen since 2023, when a federal judge ruled that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children for school with a religious exemption.  
The pertussis vaccination is administered in a five-dose series for children under 7 and booster doses for older children and adults. 
Immunity from pertussis vaccination wanes over time, and there is not a routine recommendation for boosters.

From left: Commissioners Kim Lowe of Kearney, Bruce Bailey of Lincoln (chair) and J. Michael Coffey of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The last two members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission who served with a former director who faces federal charges alleging public corruption are resigning at the governor’s request.
Liquor Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, who served as commission chair, confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner on Monday that Gov. Jim Pillen had personally asked for his resignation as well as that of Commissioner Kim Lowe of Kearney. Neither commissioner is implicated in the federal indictment.
Bailey said Pillen personally called Thursday. Bailey submitted his resignation Monday morning and said Lowe was on her way in to resign at the time of the call. The Governor’s Office confirmed both resignations had been received.
“They’re moving on,” Bailey said.
Pillen’s office will accept applications to succeed Bailey and Lowe on the governor-appointed board by 5 p.m. on Oct. 17. Applicants must reside in either the 1st or 3rd Congressional Districts for the seats, respectively, and can apply online at https://governor.nebraska.gov/boards-commissions-open-positions or mail applications to the Governor’s Office.
“I appreciate the willingness of Bruce and Kim to serve, and I thank them for the time they have been on the commission,” Pillen said in a statement.
Pillen’s latest calls for resignations from the board came Thursday, Bailey said, a day after federal charges were unsealed against former Liquor Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe. Rupe has pleaded not guilty to seven federal charges.
The calls also came the same day Pillen rejected all proposed rule changes by the commission that were still pending, including one the governor said would “effectively provide government permission for customers to touch the dancers at a strip club,” which he said was “particularly troubling” in light of Rupe’s indictment. 
Ex-Nebraska Liquor Commission director charged with taking cash, sexual favors in strip club probe

Federal prosecutors, who worked alongside the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office that had employed Rupe decades ago, allege Rupe solicited cash, lap dances, sexual favors and free drinks from two Lincoln strip clubs while also turning a “blind eye” to liquor license violations that Rupe should have reported. Rupe also allegedly used his position to investigate and target competitor venues.
Bailey and Lowe voted 2-0 in May to suspend Rupe, without pay, pending the investigation. Rupe resigned the following month, ending his service that began January 2004, ending his service that began January 2004.
Like Rupe, Brent Zywiec, a partial owner of The Office Gentleman’s Club and The Night Before Lounge who also is named in the federal indictment, has pleaded not guilty.
The other Liquor Commission member is retired Judge J. Michael Coffey, whom Pillen appointed in June. Coffey succeeded Harry Hoch. Jr., who had served on the commission since 2019. Hoch had 40 years of industry knowledge in liquor and told the Examiner his resignation came as Pillen sought “more cannabis experience” on the board.
Medical cannabis impacts
One reason: Voters in November approved creating the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and placed the three members of the Liquor Control Commission on it, along with up to two at-large appointments.
Bailey said he felt Pillen also sought his resignation due to his more permissive view of medical cannabis in light of voters’ wishes. He said some in the executive branch viewed him as a “roadblock.” 
At recent meetings, Bailey had been vocal when he felt the commission was being too restrictive, mainly at the lead of Pillen’s at-large appointees, who prefer a stricter system. Among those positions, Bailey had called to allow smoking or vaping medical cannabis and to increase the number of cultivator licenses to boost the supply chain.

Michael Coffey of Omaha. At right is Bo Botelho, general counsel for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services contracted to work with the commission. Sept. 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Members of the public attending the meetings had also praised Bailey for meeting with them one-on-one and raising their concerns.
The Medical Cannabis Commission was set to meet Tuesday but appears unlikely to approve any cultivator licenses ahead of a voter-set Oct. 1 deadline to begin issuing the first licenses. Dr. Monica Oldenburg, commission chair, had been designated to review and evaluate any applications received by last Tuesday, alongside Lowe and Bailey.
The Liquor Control Commission had been set to meet on Wednesday but will no longer meet due to a lack of members. Bailey said the commission has a “great staff” in its stead. Lowe described the staff as “rock stars.”
Oldenburg did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.
The resignations mean that, once replaced, Pillen will have appointed all three members to oversee liquor and the two others to oversee medical cannabis. Members serve staggered six-year terms.
Pillen has said the new appointments will follow his example with Coffey, whom he said “Nebraskans can trust to restore strong leadership and governance to this troubled independent agency.” Pillen’s office has said he has no intention of retooling and moving the agency under the governor’s direct control.
Reflecting on commission service
In Bailey’s 11 years on the Liquor Commission, he reflected on the group’s work to implement new software for license holders and to create a new education program for bartenders and others that is set to start soon and he said is “99% complete.”
“We’ve accomplished some good things,” Bailey said.
Bailey’s service also coincided with the 2017 vote to end liquor licenses in Whiteclay, Nebraska, establishments that were criticized for years of having contributed to alcohol-related problems on the adjacent Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where alcohol possession and sales were legally prohibited.

Lowe, who joined the Liquor Commission in 2021, said serving on the board was a great opportunity. She also highlighted the move to a new software system and said she was “very proud” of what had been accomplished in her tenure.
On the Rupe situation, Bailey said he is still surprised by the allegations, reeling and second-guessing himself and wondering, “Should I have seen something?”
“The governor said we should have known. I don’t know how we could have. We certainly don’t keep track what people do in their off time,” Bailey said.
Bailey said he partly wishes he had known and had an opportunity to intervene and at least say, “Hey, dumb s—, don’t do it.”
“I liked him a lot as a friend,” Bailey said of Rupe, “and I’m sorry that he just simply went off the deep end.”
Lowe said she had no knowledge of what Rupe is accused of doing. Hoch did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.
Asked her thoughts on the Liquor Commission moving forward, Lowe said: “I just hope the best for this organization.”
This is a developing story.

Each year, Public Lands Day is a chance to celebrate the open spaces that make Nevada extraordinary. From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery. They provide clean water and wildlife habitat, preserve Indigenous cultural sites and Indigenous homelands, drive Nevada’s outdoor recreation economy, and offer places for families to hike, camp, hunt, and recharge.
But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.
Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.
SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.
The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.
This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.
At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.
Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.
For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.
Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.
We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.
The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

The recently-renamed U.S. Department of War announced the contract late Friday afternoon.
The contract calls for the company to make almost a hundred CH-53K transport helicopters.
Sikorsky General Manager Rich Benton said the company will get years’ worth of work.
“We’re gonna be building 53K’s at least from now to 2033,” Benton said. “So pretty big deal for workforce, here, pretty big deal for Sikorsky, but also a pretty big deal for Connecticut. We invested heavily in the Connecticut supply chain.”
Many other companies that make parts and supplies for Sikorsky also employ Connecticut residents.
“It really is a foundational element, when we think about the number of aircraft we’re gonna build, the hours that go into this aircraft, and the number of jobs,” Benton said. “It’s really gonna lay the foundation for the entire Sikorsky enterprise, really for the next five to 10 years.”
Sikorsky is a major employer in Connecticut, with more than 7,000 workers in the state. It has locations in Bridgeport, Stratford, Trumbull and Shelton. An additional 3,000 Sikorsky employees work outside the state.
The CH-53K helicopters are used to move troops and supplies.

The rollout comes more than a month after Virginia’s colleges and universities, as well as others around the country, opened for the 2026-2027 school year. The launch also follows a lengthy overhaul, which the agency said will “simplify” and “modernize” the application process. The department has also made changes to the formulas used to determine aid eligibility.
The deadline to publish the revamped FAFSA form was set for October 1 by Congress and then-President Joe Biden.
Virginia braces for changes to student aid programs

The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, stated it has already begun promoting it to students and their families.
“We’re happy about the release of FAFSA and that things are going smoothly so far,” said Erin McGrath, SCHEV Associate Director of college access and PK12 Outreach, in a statement to The Mercury.
Virginia Community Colleges, which represents 23 colleges in the commonwealth, added that it is “pleased” about the release. The delay with the application process created uncertainty for  Virginia’s higher education institutions.
“After a few challenging years, the VCCS is pleased about the early release of the FAFSA for Aid Year 2026-2027,” said Laurie Owens, director of financial aid for VCCS. “We look forward to a more streamlined process for our students and families through the simplified contributor invite process as well as the real-time identity verification process. Financial aid will never be simple, but enhancements such as these will certainly help.” 
On Aug. 27, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon certified to Congress that the 2026–27 FAFSA form would launch “on time” in the fall after a “successful” beta test with education leaders, students and families took place in Florida in the same month.
The agency said 97% of respondents reported “satisfaction” with the form, and 90% said it took a “reasonable time” to complete it.
The number of 2026-2027 FAFSA applications has increased from 43,531 on Sept. 24 to 183,752 as of Sept. 25.
Out of a total of 183,752 applications, the agency reported that 53% had been submitted as of Sept. 25. A total of 31% had been processed, and 29% had been processed without rejection.
“I am extremely proud to announce the earliest launch of the FAFSA form in history, which ensures American students and families have access to critical resources as they begin or continue their postsecondary education journey,” McMahon said in a statement on Wednesday.

,DC,2025-09-29 17:00:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump asks US Supreme Court to take birthright citizenship case,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-take-birthright-citizenship-case,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has again petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court regarding birthright citizenship, this time on the merits of the administration’s effort to rewrite the constitutional right afforded to children born on U.S. soil. In two cases brought to the high court, lower courts kept in place a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order that ended birthright citizenship. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer petitioned the court Friday to reverse those decisions. The high court case was docketed Monday. Responses from both parties are due by Oct. 29.Sauer is asking the justices to revisit the 14th amendment, arguing that it was meant to grant citizenship to newly freed Black people after the Civil War, not for the children of immigrants with temporary visas or in the country without legal authorization. “The mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” Sauer wrote.Sauer did not ask the court to fast-track the petition, so if the justices decide to take up the case the earliest they would do so would be the summer of next year. One case is from Washington state on behalf of attorneys general in that state, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. The other case is from New Hampshire, where a national of Honduras is due to give birth in October and fears her child will not be granted U.S. citizenship.Immigration policy stymiedSauer said the president’s executive order aimed to advance his immigration policy and that lower courts' decisions to block that agenda harms the U.S.“The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship—the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders—is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it. The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” he wrote. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”The Trump administration in March brought the issue to the high court on an emergency basis, but did not ask the justices to determine the constitutionality of birthright citizenship. Instead, the administration asked the court to address the issue of nationwide injunctions from the lower courts. In June, the Supreme Court reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked the executive order rewriting birthright citizenship.Executive order rewrote 14th AmendmentThe order Trump signed in January directs the federal government to not recognize or issue citizenship documentation to any child born after Feb. 19 to parents who are in the country without proper authorization, or if the parent is in the United States on a temporary visa and the other parent is a noncitizen or green card holder. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the U.S. are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status, except for the children born to foreign diplomats. The administration interprets that phrase in the 14th Amendment that confers birthright citizenship to people “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” to exclude people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status. Those people are subject to the laws of their home country, the administration argues.The Supreme Court has ruled on birthright citizenship many times, including a 1898 decision in which the justices upheld birthright citizenship in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.Ark was born in San Francisco to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had visas giving them legal authority to be in the country. Ark’s citizenship was not recognized when he left the U.S. and he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act — a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.The high court ruled in Ark’s case that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.",,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

The 50-page settlement agreement, filed in the bankruptcy court Friday, asks the judge to approve the settlement between Prospect and Yale by Oct. 10. 
In the filing, Thomas Califano, an attorney for Prospect, wrote “everybody’s pretty satisfied” with the outcome, although “I don’t think anybody’s happy with it.” 
Prospect signed a deal in 2022 to sell Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Hospital and Rockville General Hospital to Yale for $435 million. But that agreement hit snags and both parties sued each other. 
This January, Prospect Medical filed for bankruptcy. Less than a month after the bankruptcy filing, Yale announced it was pulling out of the deal completely stating the bankruptcy filing was “proof of their disinvestment and mismanagement.”
At an August hearing in the bankruptcy case, in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, the judge encouraged Prospect and Yale to settle their dispute through mediation. 
The two sides, along with Prospect’s landlord Medical Properties Trust, met for an in-person mediation session in mid-September with Judge Harlin D. Hale to work out the settlement.
“The settlement agreement is the result of good-faith negotiations among the debtors, MPT, and YNHH, during which the Committee was present and informed,” Califano wrote.
Yale New Haven Health spokeswoman Dana Marnane said Monday the “settlement will officially end all pending litigation between our Health System and Prospect allowing both parties to move forward and focus on the future.”
The two parties had been at odds since Yale sued to have the $435 million purchase price lowered after a cyberattack struck the three Prospect Hospitals two years ago, crippling some of their operations for months.
Yale officials said it would cost as much as $80 million for Yale to repair the damages to the hospital’s computer security systems because of the cyberattack. It also claimed Prospect had failed to pay some of its vendors for years and also owed the state of Connecticut at least $67 million in taxes.
Prospect then countersued, arguing Yale was trying to renege on the agreement and cited the stalled sale as part of the reason it needed to file for bankruptcy. Both lawsuits will be dismissed as part of the settlement agreement.
Meanwhile the fate of Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals remains in bankruptcy court. Yale is no longer a player, but its main competitor Hartford HealthCare has stepped into the fray.
Hartford HealthCare has offered $86.1 million to purchase two of the three hospitals — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General.
ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the two hospitals in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Meanwhile, state officials are in high-level discussions regarding a deal in which the University of Connecticut Health Center would purchase the third Prospect facility, Waterbury Hospital, along with the independently owned Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals. Officials are considering a total for the deal that could reach nearly $400 million, sources said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

Delaware’s 38th annual Coastal Cleanup drew more than 950 volunteers to over 45 sites on Sept. 13, clearing 5,121 pounds of debris from beaches, wetlands, and waterways from Fenwick Island to Battery Park, according to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
Participation held steady from 2024, but this year’s haul was 3,000 pounds heavier. Cigarette butts, food wrappers, and bottle caps topped the list of most-collected items, while larger finds included a car exhaust, other car parts, and a bean bag chair. 
“This annual event brings together neighbors and visitors willing to put a few hours into protecting our beautiful coastline, with all those individual acts adding up to a significant result,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson, who joined Senator Kyra Hoffner, Senator Stephanie Hansen and other volunteers for the cleanup at Big Stone Beach. “Taking more than 2 tons of trash off the beach – much of it one bit of plastic at a time – shows the true power of collective action.”

DNREC noted that the data recorded by volunteers helps the state understand what’s washing up on Delaware’s shores and informs efforts to reduce litter. The results are also submitted to the International Ocean Conservancy’s Coastal Cleanup database to contribute to global trends and solutions for cleaner oceans and waterways.
“It has been a wonderful experience to be involved with coastal cleanup for 20 years,” said Jennifer Pongratz, DNREC Division of Watershed Stewardship environmental scientist, and longtime Coastal Cleanup committee member. “I love getting to see the same volunteers year after year that return to their favorite spots to give back in their community, as well as newcomers to the cleanup who get to experience the joy of this act of service for the first time.”
DNREC emphasized that keeping beaches and waterways clean is a year-round effort.

(Photo courtesy of the National Weather Service)COLUMBIA — Warnings to brace for the worst have subsided after incoming Tropical Storm Imelda’s predicted path turned out to sea, according to the National Weather Service.
Coastal residents should prepare for about 1 inch of rain from scattered storms Tuesday, followed by drier weather with temperatures in the 70s and 80s over the following days. Flooding is still possible in some areas, but not more than during a typical storm, the National Weather Service said in briefings Monday.
SC under state of emergency as possible tropical storm approaches

With the risks diminished, the state Emergency Management Division returned to normal operations Monday, according to a news release. But a state of emergency, which allows officials to more easily mobilize response teams and apply for federal disaster aid, remained in effect as of noon Monday.
Tropical Storm Imelda, which formed from an unnamed tropical disturbance over the weekend, could have made landfall in the Carolinas or parked just off the coast. Either option could have caused major flooding, and high winds could have knocked down trees and powerlines, the National Weather Service said previously.
Instead, meteorologists expect the storm to take a sharp right turn early Tuesday, away from the Carolinas and further east in the Atlantic Ocean, largely following the path of the much larger Hurricane Humberto, according to the weather service.
Swimmers and boaters should stay wary this week, and those with little experience should stay out of the water altogether. The combined force of Imelda and Humberto is expected to churn up the surf along the South Carolina coast, creating dangerous rip currents and waves as tall as 12 feet through the weekend, according to the latest weather briefings.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)When David Gutierrez of Laguna had surgery to remove his gallbladder earlier this year, he and his wife of 45 years Rebecca Gutierrez thought his recovery would be simple and straightforward. Instead, several complications left the couple worrying about his care and their rapidly shrinking funds.
Rebecca Gutierrez previously worked at her local senior center in Laguna, where she interacted with many people who, she told Source New Mexico, worried about being unable to afford to leave their jobs or care for aging parents on their own. Then she attended one of the New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s annual Conference of Aging and learned about New MexiCare, a program that helps fill the gaps for seniors who have cognitive or physical limitations and don’t qualify for Medicaid, but have limited financial means.
 After receiving funding during the 2024 legislative session, the program rolled out as a pilot that year, but only in limited counties and not in Cibola County, where the couple lived. NewMexiCare later expanded to 31 of the state’s 33 counties — everywhere but Bernalillo and Doña Ana counties —and, as of this month, became available statewide
According to a Sept. 16 news release from the ALTSD, 285 New Mexicans have been enrolled in New MexiCare since its official launch in October 2024, and over $1.2 million in financial assistance has been distributed.
While at the 2025 Annual Conference on Aging in Glorieta last week, Aging Secretary Emily Kaltenbach told Source that enrollment numbers have tripled since she took over the department last fall.
“The challenge ahead of us is money,” she said. “People get on the program, but attrition is not at the same rate as people coming on. And so, that’s going to be something we’re going to have to tackle at a legislative level.  We have to show how impactful it is so that we can get additional funding.”
The Gutierrezes were two of more than 1,400 senior New Mexicans and caregivers who attended the conference this week, and made a point to share their story with Kaltenbach.
After David Gutierrez became sick with gallstones in April 2025, he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder and Rebecca became his primary caregiver. But he didn’t improve after the surgery.
“We went home and he’s not getting any better,” she told Source. “He still hurts and doctors would say, ‘You know, he’s older. He’s 71 years old, it takes longer [to heal].’” 
David ended up back in the emergency room and doctors discovered that fluid had formed where his gallbladder had been, and he had developed an abscess on his liver. The medical team asked if the couple could travel 45 minutes from their home to Albuquerque frequently for treatment, but the travel costs would have compounded their financial situation. “I’ve already used my resources taking care of him,” Rebecca said. 
She called New MexiCare and arranged an appointment for organizers to interview the two of them in their home to assess their needs. During the two-week wait, David’s situation remained complicated. “One week he had seven doctor’s appointments,” she said.
And because of the toll the surgery and subsequent complications took on his body, David was weaker than he had ever been and had trouble getting around. He had to use a walker for the first time in his life. After the assessment, he was approved for New MexiCare, including 17 hours a week for in-home care and four-and-a-half hours of transportation. The couple told Source that before they received a check from New MexiCare, their savings were almost completely used up. They said they were worried about how they would pay for the copays for all of David’s appointments.
“I’ve always advocated for the caregivers, but to become one was totally different,” Rebecca said. 
With help and financial assistance from New MexiCare and Social Security, the couple have been able to focus on David’s recovery. And Rebecca said she recently became the president of the advisory group in Laguna for seniors. 
“I told them, ‘I’m going to educate you guys how to take advantage of this opportunity that we finally have,’” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-MexiCare-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-29 12:57:13.149655

A proposed state constitutional amendment would increase Florida's homestead exemption for property taxes. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Although the specifics of such a proposal are still unknown, a majority of Floridians say that, if given the chance, they would vote for some form of property tax reform. That’s according to a public opinion survey commissioned by the James Madison Institute (JMI) released on Monday.
If a constitutional amendment to significantly reduce or eliminate property taxes were on the ballot, 65% would support that. Only 15% oppose it, with 20% unsure.
Constitutional amendments in Florida must win 60% support to go into effect.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has been campaigning for months on the idea that Floridians want and need property tax relief, and has floated the idea that Florida could become the first state in the nation to completely eliminate them.
But property taxes pay for crucial local services like police, fire departments, and schools. A study by the Florida Policy Institute concluded that eliminating property taxes for homesteaded properties would cost $18.5 billion.
As a way to preempt those arguments by local government officials, Florida’s recently appointed chief financial officer, Blaise Ingoglia, has been making appearances around the state calling out local governments for alleged “wasteful spending” (without specifying what reaches that definition).
Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez formed a select committee to study the issue earlier this year, and that group met twice last week in Tallahassee to determine how such a proposal could be written. It’s expected that the Florida Legislature will approve a resolution for a constitutional amendment sometime during the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January, with the measure to appear on the November 2026 ballot.
On the philosophy of property taxes, 39% of those surveyed said they are a “valid” revenue source but should be limited. Another 33% said property taxes should be eliminated outright. Only 20% said they were critical for funding local government services and should be preserved. Another 8% weren’t sure.
Sixty-six percent of Floridians worry they may not be able to afford to continue living in their homes or communities due to rising property taxes or other housing costs.
There were plenty of other nuggets in the JMI survey, including that 62% of Florida voters oppose a DeSantis administration proposal to eliminate vaccine requirements.
Jolly competitive in one-on-one matchups with top Republicans
Nearly one in three registered voters (30%) describe themselves as “politically homeless,” feeling unrepresented by either the Democratic or Republican parties.
Regarding the 2026 gubernatorial race, in a hypothetical matchup between Republican Byron Donalds, Democrat David Jolly, and independent candidate state Sen. Jason Pizzo, Donalds leads Jolly, 36%-32%, with Pizzo at 4%.
In a three-way race with former House Speaker Paul Renner as the GOP candidate, Renner leads Jolly, 34%-33%, with Pizzo at 5%.
In a GOP race between Donalds and Renner, Donalds leads, 29%-9%.
But when Republican voters were asked for whom they would vote among “announced and potential candidates,” it’s First Lady Casey DeSantis who gets the most support. She leads Donalds 26%-23%, with Renner at 7%, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins at 2%, and Agriculture Commission Wilton Simpson at 2%.
The survey’s questions did not refer to the fact that Donalds has been endorsed by Donald Trump for president.
The survey of 1,200 registered voters in Florida was conducted by Targoz Market Research for the James Madison Institute between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, with a margin for error +/- 2.77%.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-29 15:54:13+00:00,CT Mirror,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa and Shauneen Miranda | States Newsroom",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/federal-shutdown-explainer-health-immigration-politics/,Nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by Oct. 1.,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. 
A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. 
The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.
Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. 
[RELATED: As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies]
That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.
How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?
Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. 
But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. 
Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. 
That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”
Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.
The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.
While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”
Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.
No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. 
Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?
The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. 
The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. 
As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. 
The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. 
During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” 
Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.
What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?
The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” 
This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.
One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. 
The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.
Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?
Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.
But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.
Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.
All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.
Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.
“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they’re not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that’s going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.
“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it’s going to matter a lot to them. It’s going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.
The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.
What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? 
As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.
Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. 
That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”
Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  
DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.
Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.
The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.
And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. 
States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? 
Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.
During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.
Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.
“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”
The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. 
Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.
But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.
“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”
Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. 
Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.
“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that’s not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”
As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.
What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?
How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. 
When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. 
The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. 
Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.
The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. 
Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.
Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.
“It’s really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.
Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?
According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” 
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. 
That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. 
What role does Congress have during a shutdown?
The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. 
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   
Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  
Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn’t expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. 
Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. 
Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. 
Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” 
“Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
BETA Technologies filed for an initial public offering on Monday morning, after reports of the move circulated last week. 
The South Burlington-based company plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange “as soon as practicable” under the symbol “BETA,” according to Monday’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The electric and hybrid aircraft company has raised over $1.5 billion in capital through private equity investment and development contracts since its founding in 2017. The company opened a 188,500-square-foot production facility in South Burlington in 2023, and also runs a battery testing site in St. Albans.
“Electric aviation is inevitable,” wrote founding CEO Kyle Clark in a letter within the filing. “We believe it will lower the cost of flight, improve safety, expand aviation’s utility, and do so in balance with our environment.”
Monday’s filing comes just weeks after the company announced a high-profile partnership with GE Aerospace, which plans to make a $300 million equity investment in BETA.
The filing’s primary underwriters, taking on the financial risk of the offering, are Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
BETA is in an enforced “quiet period” following its filing Monday and declined to comment.
This story will be updated.

Jared Golden. 
A political organization titled “Dunlap for Congress” was established on Thursday, as Bloomberg News first reported on Friday. Dunlap, who previously served as Maine’s Secretary of State for seven terms, first floated the idea of his potential run for Congress in District 2 in May and previously said he’d planned to make a decision by Oct. 1.
Golden is in his fourth term representing District 2, which comprises the majority of the state geographically north of Augusta. Voters in that district have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while going for President Donald Trump each time he’s run for president. 
Dunlap, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, made a national name for himself during Trump’s first term when serving on the president’s voter fraud commission. 
Dunlap refused to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested (which current Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited when defending her decision to do the same). He also won a lawsuit against the group after its Republican leadership intentionally excluded him from deliberations. And, after it was disbanded, Dunlap chalked up the commission to being set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims. 
Dunlap is seen as more progressive than Golden, who often breaks with his party on votes. Golden did so recently as the only House Democrat to back a Republican stopgap spending proposal that did not include an extension of a health care tax credit. 
The IRS filing provides some insight into those behind Dunlap’s potential run for higher office. 
Brandon Philipczyk is listed as the custodian of records and contact person. He happens to be the same person named on the form establishing the political organization for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner, who is challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
Philipczyk is also listed on those forms for other progressive challengers running for Congress, including Morgan Coghill in Illinois, Eric Descheenie in Arizona and Joey Mendoza Atkins in Florida.

Bob Menendez, asked for lenient sentencing in exchange for his aid.","Jose Uribe, front, toasts Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife Nadine at one of several dinners he and his friends treated the couple to during what prosecutors say was a wide-ranging bribery scheme that started in 2018. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Attorneys for a failed insurance broker who testified that he bribed former Sen. Bob Menendez are asking a federal court for a lenient sentence, arguing their client was instrumental in securing the senator’s corruption conviction.
They said Jose Uribe, who gave the senator’s wife a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for Menendez’s intercession in a state insurance fraud case against a friend, testified despite fears of harassment and intimidation, and that his role in the trial justified a non-custodial sentence.
“Jose has learned the hardest of lessons by accepting responsibility for his crimes and by doing one of the most difficult, scary and grueling things imaginable — cooperating and being the government’s star witness in a historic, ultra-high-profile trial of one of the most powerful politicians at that time in America,” Uribe’s attorneys said in a court filing.
Uribe is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 9.
Ex-senator’s wife gets 4.5 years in prison for global bribery scheme

Uribe in March 2024 pleaded guilty to seven counts of bribery, obstruction, wire fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy as part of an agreement to exchange his testimony for prosecutors’ recommendation of a lenient sentence. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 95 years behind bars.
He served as a star witness during the Menendez prosecution, testifying for two days on how he bribed the senator.
Uribe’s attorneys said he faced risks testifying against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when charged.
They said two men stopped his ex-wife outside a bank in April 2024 before being scared away by a bank clerk, and that a “strange man” appeared unannounced and uninvited in Uribe’s office to arrange a meeting with Nadine Menendez, the senator’s wife, so the two could agree on a lie about why Uribe was making her car payments.
“In this case, he was only delivering a message … however, in that harrowing moment, Jose realized that if — instead of wanting to avoid prosecution by making up a false story — someone had wanted to silence him through violence, he was vulnerable,” Uribe’s attorneys said.
Nadine Menendez was also convicted as part of the bribery scheme, and earlier this month was sentenced to nearly five years in prison. Bob Menendez is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.
Uribe’s testimony also helped lead to convictions for co-defendants Wael Hana, a halal meat exporter, and real estate developer Fred Daibes.
Along with the sentencing memo, Uribe’s attorneys submitted numerous letters from friends, colleagues, and family members who urged leniency.
Osvaldo Lopez, a longtime friend, said Uribe housed him and his family in an Elizabeth apartment after Lopez immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 2002.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.  I had only recently met Jose — he barely knew me — yet he was doing something truly generous and life-changing for me and my family. That moment told me everything I needed to know about the kind of man he is, someone who helps others without hesitation and never expects anything in return,” Lopez said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)At a moment of Republican soul‐searching about the state’s role in economic development, Bill Even says the choice is clear.
“The choice should be to grow, and being thoughtful about doing that,” he said. “Because the alternative — and I’ve seen it with farms and over the course of my career — when they stop growing, when they stop innovating, when they stop buying new equipment, when they stop building things, those farms wither up and they go away. And I think as a state, we don’t want that. We don’t look backward for inspiration. We look forward.”
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed Even in April to lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. Even previously led the office from 2006 to 2007.
Rhoden hasn’t officially declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet, while at least three other people are already running, including U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota. The other two candidates have been vocal in their criticism of the state’s economic development efforts. Gubernatorial candidate and current Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, has criticized Even’s office and pledged to end what Hansen calls “corporate welfare,” while Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has said the state should focus on helping existing businesses thrive instead of recruiting new ones.
Even’s roots run deep in the state. He is a fifth-generation family farmer from rural Humboldt, where his ancestors homesteaded in Dakota Territory in 1884. His career has included stints as state secretary of agriculture, state energy policy director and CEO of the National Pork Board.
The following interview with Even has been edited for length and clarity.
What is your economic development philosophy? 
Everything grows, right? So as a farmer, we grow crops, and we grow livestock, and we as people, we also grow. We grow, not only physically, but we should also be growing in our knowledge, wisdom and faith. 
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

I kind of bring that same mindset to the question of “what does growth look like for the state of South Dakota,” knowing that we all grow, because the opposite choice is stasis, which leads to decline. 
Recognizing that we’re living in a competitive environment — both in the United States amongst the states, as well as globally — I want to make sure that we bring that idea that we’re frugal, but not cheap. So, when we do build things, we’re going to build them and do it well and do it right. 
And then also I think a key point is that we’re bold but not reckless. You’ve got to be bold enough to take a leap of faith in business and to build things and do things. You’ve got to take some risks. But you don’t want to be reckless about it either. 
I think that’s where a lot of these conversations tend to land: Where’s that appropriate sweet spot, so that we are looking at expansion of businesses in South Dakota, retention of businesses in South Dakota, as well as any recruitment we want to do. We want to make sure it’s the right place and the right fit with the right business model. 
What is your message to Republicans calling the state’s incentive-based approach “corporate welfare?”
At a really high level, South Dakota is a conservative state. I reflect that as a person. And I completely understand that as a taxpayer in South Dakota. 
But I think it comes back to the question of, “Do we want to grow the pie here in South Dakota or look at everything as a fixed pie?” That’s this idea that everything grows. And if we want to grow our economy and grow our tax base, well, we’re operating in a highly competitive environment. I don’t think it would be wise for South Dakota to unilaterally disarm in this space. 
Number one, it starts with the retention of businesses in the state. Number two, then you move on to focus on what can be done to help them expand and make sure that they are successful here. And then third on the list are the businesses looking around the world and saying, “You know what? South Dakota’s got the business climate. It’s got the accessibility of its leadership. And they’re hard workers. This is a place where I would like to have my business located.”
We all came here from somewhere at some point in time, and I think we also need to acknowledge the fact that if businesses want to come to South Dakota, we want to make sure that we are open for that opportunity. 
How competitive is the recruitment and retention of businesses?
When states are looking to grow and expand, they’re always looking to recruit workers and businesses into their states to help grow their economies. They know that it’s not a zero-sum game and that by growing the pie, there are benefits. 
I worked in sales with Pioneer Seed. For three years, I ran their commercial business here in the Upper Midwest, and had 350 people on the sales team. And you’re in a competitive environment where there are other people trying to get to your customers. Our job was to be on their farm and be their provider of choice.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I kind of look at South Dakota as being in a similar position, where we’re in a highly competitive environment with other states. Instead of other brands that may be selling against you, it’s other states that are talking about their quality of life, their workforce, the tools they have available, like low-interest loans and the like. And so we operate in that space, whether we like it or not. 
We can choose to be in the game, and be in the game smart, or we can choose to be out of the game and sit on the sidelines. Those are choices. 
What do you say to those who feel economic development incentives are undermining the concept of a free market?
There are the rules of the game and the playing field. And if there were no incentives with any state, anywhere, anytime — if there were no partnership programs and no low-interest loan programs — then that would be the playing field that you were on and those are the rules you would follow. 
The way that the reality works in economic development and business is that there are 50 different U.S. states, and they are all in the business of looking to attract people, attract businesses and workers. I think South Dakota is merely playing by the same rules of the game and the way the field is set up today, nationally. 
I truly do appreciate the sentiment. But the reality is, on the ground, if we choose not to play and everybody else is still playing, I know how that’ll turn out. Sitting at the bench on the sideline doesn’t give you a chance. 
Are you looking to introduce any measures to alleviate the frustrations of some Republicans regarding economic development?
I said in front of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee right after I started, “Look, the question you always ask people is are you here to help fix the problem, or are you here to affix blame?” And I’m here to help fix problems, to the extent that there are any problems. And at the end of the day, if you are doing good work with good companies, you’re going to have a good track record.
For example, the default rate on the REDI [Revolving Economic Development and Initiative] loan program over 38 years is like two-tenths of 1%. It’s incredibly solid. Across the 38 years of just the Future Fund alone, 1,687 grants have gone out. Over $630 million adjusted for inflation. The successful track record here is incredible.
At the end of the day, we also know this is an election year. So, there’s a lot more talk and discussion, but my intent here, as a public servant, is to fix any problems. 
My pickup’s got a huge windshield. It’s got a small rearview mirror. You need to look in it from time to time to kind of see where you’ve been and what’s worked and what’s not, but I’m looking forward. 
How do you ensure your office’s return on investment is adequate?
We have a team whose job it is to track South Dakota’s status nationally, track what other states are doing, what our competitors are doing, and how the competitive landscape is changing. But they also do a return on investment analysis in conjunction with our finance and loan team and the Board of Economic Development. 
A lot of people call here, a lot of people talk to GOED, but only projects that are deemed viable are the ones that we bring forward. I think the public should rest assured that there’s a team and there’s a process in place that evaluates all of these things. 
Ultimately, out in the free market, you never know what will happen. Something may change. Circumstances may change. But at the end of the day, we try to tee up the ones that are best positioned for success, and that’s what we put in front of the Board of Economic Development for their evaluation. And they evaluate things separately and independently from us. They’re bankers and business owners in the state that are very experienced. 
There is a lot of anxiety regarding economic development opportunities like wind and solar energy, data centers, small nuclear reactors. How do you think about those developments?
As a businessperson, you evaluate every opportunity on its merits when it arises, right? 
We take a look at the project and say, “Is this project viable? Is this something that could fit in South Dakota? And if so, where would it be a good fit in South Dakota?” And then you take a look at the alternatives.
In many cases, if the alternative is carte blanche saying, “Well, I don’t want this particular business, I don’t want this type of business,” the marginal tax revenue is zero, because the business was never built, the people were never here, the money was never invested. That’s stasis. 
Versus saying, “There’s an opportunity to build something or do something, and well, let’s evaluate it. What’s the credibility of the business? Where might it be a good fit?” And when you do that, it should have a marginal increase to the gross domestic product in South Dakota. It brings jobs, it brings property tax revenue, and it brings sales tax revenue. 
It doesn’t mean that things don’t cost money, that roads don’t need to be built, and power lines don’t need to be built, and water lines don’t need to be built. But at the end of the day, you have a choice between stasis or taking a chance on something after you’ve had the opportunity to vet it.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0724-1-scaled-e1759155364582-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 10:57:41.625749

“Programs like LIAP can make a real difference for those struggling to afford their electric bill,” said Public Advocate Heather Sanborn. “If you receive a letter, show it to your utility. This simple step could mean a real savings on your electric bill.” 
Credits vary based on income, household size and electricity usage. 
To be eligible for LIAP, a household must be eligible for the federal utility assistance program or participate in another income-based DHHS assistance program with a household income at or less than 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. That would be between roughly $23,000 and $48,000 for households with one to four people. 
Households who are already enrolled in the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also referred to as LIHEAP, will be automatically enrolled in the state’s LIAP program. 
To receive the LIAP benefits, Mainers who receive a letter only need to present it to their utility company, according to a news release from the Office of the Public Advocate. Contact information for the utility company should be included as part of the letter. 
The release from Sanborn’s office urged residents to keep an eye out for these letters and apply for aid as soon as possible. Mainers who do not receive a letter but believe they may qualify to receive assistance should contact their electricity utility or local Community Action Agency.

The $10 billion behemoth will be as big as 70 football fields.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.
The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.
Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.
Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.
“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.
Private deals for public power supply
Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.
Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.
Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.
Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.
Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.
“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.
Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.
Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.
Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.
But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”
How is this tackled in other states?
Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.
Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.
And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.
Locals have mixed feelings
Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.
“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.
In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.
But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.
“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

(Photo by Roman Dial/Alaska Pacific University)When scientists Patrick Sullivan and Roman Dial were heading to a remote area in the Brooks Range in 2019 to map the spread of woody plants there, they were looking forward to seeing a celebrated river that author John McPhee described decades ago as having the “clearest, purest water I have ever seen flowing over rocks.”
What they found in the Salmon River, a waterway that flows through Northwest Alaska’s Kobuk Valley National Park, was much different than what McPhee described in his landmark 1976 Alaska book “Coming Into the Country.” The waters Sullivan and Dial found were reddish-orange and murky from loads of minerals flowing into them.
The Salmon River and its tributaries had become transformed into “rusting rivers,” a phenomenon caused by climate change in permafrost regions.
“The permafrost is thawing, and it’s essentially acid rock drainage that’s occurring. These sulfite minerals are being exposed to oxygen and water for the first time in thousands of years and it’s releasing acid which is leaching metals out of the rocks to the streams,” said Sullivan, who heads the Environment and Natural Resource Institute at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
The problem goes beyond aesthetics, according to further research by Sullivan, Dial, who is at Alaska Pacific University, and their colleagues.
The Salmon River, a designated wild and scenic river, and its tributaries are so tainted by acid-rock drainage that their concentration of metals is considered toxic to chronically exposed aquatic life, they found.
Water samples taken in the summers of 2022 and 2023 found that the river and almost all of its tributaries were carrying metals at levels above U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state of Alaska standards, according to a recently published study by Sullivan and his colleagues. A variety of metals were showing up in amounts dangerous to aquatic life: iron, cadmium, aluminum, nickel, zinc and copper, their study found.
The “rusting rivers” pollution is similar to the kind of pollution that can happen from hardrock metals mining. But unlike the case with mining, it is happening in the absence of human development, and it is happening over diffuse spots, whereas a single point source at a mine that could potentially be controlled.
“This wild and scenic river in the heart of Kobuk Valley National Park, it’s about as protected as you can get and as remote as you can get. And it’s kind of falling apart,” Sullivan said.
The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarized the situation in its title: “Wild, scenic, and toxic.”
There are places around the Arctic where rust-red rivers have been that way for centuries, like Canada’s Arctic Red River, also known in the Gwich’in language as Tsiigehnjik, meaning “iron river.”
But for the Salmon River, the change was abrupt.
The Bush pilot who ferried Sullivan and Dial to the site in 2019, who described the river’s appearance as similar to sewage, said it had just happened that year.
The toxicity findings are potentially ominous for fish health.
The timing of the change suggests that thaw-induced acid rock drainage could be one of the many factors depressing western Alaska salmon runs, the study found.

	Salmon runs have been disastrously low in the region for the past few years, sometimes precluding even traditional subsistence harvests that are relatively small in scale but hugely important to culture and food security.
At the very least, the timing is a coincidence, Sullivan said. “It’s identical to what you would expect if these degrading streams were impacting spawning success,” he said, pointing out that most of the chum salmon that returns to the Kotzebue Sound area do so at the ages of four of five years, after emerging from the spawning rivers and swimming around in the ocean.
There is too little evidence for now to definitely link the rust-tinted waters of the Salmon River to poor salmon runs, Sullivan said. That is largely because there is too little known about that river’s fish populations, though the name suggests that the river was important to salmon in the past, he said.
It appears to have been that way in the 1970s, when McPhee was there boating there, fishing, camping and collecting information for his book.
At that time, the water was so clear that the riverbed was “as distinct as if the water were not there,” McPhee wrote. Those clear waters chock-full of oval-shaped salmon swimming upstream to spawn, he wrote. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins,” he wrote.
The recent proliferation of rusting rivers is not limited to Alaska and other parts of the Arctic. There are affected high-altitude areas that have permafrost, glaciers or both, including Switzerland and neighboring parts of the Alps, Peru and parts of Colorado.
In Alaska, the rusting rivers phenomenon is more pronounced in the western part of the North Slope than in the eastern part, Sullivan and Dial have found. Their past studies linked the vegetation changes in the northwest to more pronounced warming on the Chukchi Sea side of Alaska’s Arctic than on the Beaufort Sea. That spread of woody plants is detrimental to tundra caribou that eat lichen and moss, and could help explain the decline in the Western Arctic caribou herd, which has a habitat that is changing more quickly than that of the Porcupine caribou herd on the eastern North Slope, they found.
After Sullivan and Dial encountered multiple rusting rivers during their plant studies, they felt compelled to alert fellow Alaskans about the situation.
They penned a 2022 column for the Anchorage Daily News. And they embarked on their further studies, which wound up generating a small National Science Foundation grant, creating partnerships with scientists at other universities who are experts in biochemistry and, ultimately, the newly published study on toxicity.
But before then, when they were expecting to see the same conditions that McPhee did in the 1970s, Sullivan packed a fishing rod with the gear he took on the trip to the Salmon River.
His attempts to fish in the murky, opaque water proved futile, however. “I think I tried for, like, five minutes and then I quickly realized that I was wasting my time,” he said.
That experience suggests that there might be further ecological impacts of the cloudy, rusted waters, he said.
“I think it would be very hard, for instance, for a bear to fish for a salmon just because of the turbidity. Raptors would have a really hard time catching a fish if they were fishing there,” he said, citing the suspended solids that make the water opaque.
For now, Sullivan and other scientists are using satellite imagery to spot other rivers and streams that might be similarly affected. The imagery is useful not just for spotting acid-tinted streams but the point sources in the tundra, he said.
It would be helpful to have more research on the region’s fish to explore whether they are carrying metals in their bodies, he said. Another topic of study could be the response of chum salmon in the region, as the species does show the some ability to shift habitats, he said.
Yet to be determined, Sullivan said, is how long this rusting river situation will last.
“It’s possible that this will kind of run its course over some period of time. And once the unweathered sulfite minerals have been oxidized, then it’s likely that the stream will turn back to clear again,” he said. “But we have no idea when that process might reach its conclusion and how many new acid seeps might develop.”

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Larry Lessig, Harvard law professor and activist 







THE LATEST NEW ENGLAND effort to limit money in politics looks from a distance like a doomed project, betting on a conservative high court’s appetite to revisit the landmark Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates to unlimited fundraising and spending. But backers of a Maine ballot measure believe the Roberts court might want a chance to clarify how much influence the wealthy can flex in US elections.  
Efforts to restrict money flowing into super political action committees (PACs), which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigns as long as they don’t coordinate with the candidates they back, keep bumping up against the same issue: lower courts consistently declare that under Citizens United, that is simply unconstitutional.  
The landmark US Supreme Court decision in 2010 declared that political spending is protected speech and, unless there is a risk of quid-pro-quo corruption, that restricting the independent spending of corporations, unions, and nonprofit groups violates the First Amendment. 
In his concurring opinion in Citizens United, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that “the First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer.”  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Harvard law professor and political activist Larry Lessig about an ill-fated attempt to restrict PAC contributions in Massachusetts and the successful ballot effort in Maine. A coalition spearheaded by Lessig thinks it has a shot at convincing higher courts to embrace their legal theory – not to overturn Citizens United, but to embrace an originalist argument that might clarify its boundaries. 
“Though there are Republican super PACs and there are Democratic super PACs, what we’re worried about is there are no working class super PACS versus the rich person super PACs,” Lessig said. “All these super PACs are basically funded by the super super wealthy in America.”  
While individuals can only contribute $3,500 to a federal candidate during an election cycle, Lessig noted that the last cycle puts a somewhat absurd point on the role of super PAC contributions. Elon Musk’s PAC spent about $200 million to help elect Donald Trump, largely funded through Musk’s own contribution of $239 million, and the world’s richest man contributed millions to other PACs backing Republican Senate candidates and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” message. 
“The idea that the risk of corruption from a $3,300 contribution,” which is where the limit stood in the 2023-2024 cycle, “is greater than the risk of corruption from a $277 million contribution is just crazy talk,” Lessig said. “It’s not any opinion that the Supreme Court has ever uttered.” 
Then-Attorney General Maura Healey’s office rejected a ballot measure in 2022 in Massachusetts that would have capped super PAC contributions to $5,000, arguing that it would violate free speech rights. The matter died without the state’s high court ever getting into the merits, so Lessig turned to the northernmost New England state. 
Maine voters in 2024 overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure limiting Super PAC contributions to $5,000. Super PACs sued and won in the US District Court for the District of Maine. Lessig said an appeal will be filed in October with the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.  
The law’s backers say they not only expected the lawsuit, but climbing the courts was the plan.  
It was “designed to force the legal question,” agreed on by lower courts but never by the US Supreme Court, on whether Citizens United means that someone has the constitutional right to contribute unlimited amounts of money to PACs.  
Spending from all partisan PACs is soaring, Lessig said. 
“There’s no partisan reason to like PACs anymore,” he said, “and I think this Supreme Court would look at the world they’re in right now, where money in politics, Pew reports, is the number one issue Americans’ care about, that we have to fix this if we’re going to fix everything else, and they would look at the kind of corruption that’s in very plain sight right now with the president and everything else going on, and find it very hard to uphold a rule that would continue to fuel all of that corruption.”

WILMINGTON — Aternium marked its two-year anniversary on Thursday, September 25, with the announcement of a $1 million investment from the State of Delaware to support the company’s next phase of engineering toward producing industrial clean hydrogen.
Nearly 100 community leaders attended the event, where Lt. Governor Kyle Evans Gay and Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) Director CJ Bell presented a ceremonial check to Aternium founder Dr. Andrew Cottone.
The state’s $1 million investment comes from the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP), one of four initiatives funded through the U.S. Treasury Department’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Delaware is administering $60.9 million in SSBCI funds to expand access to capital for start-up and early-stage businesses.
Governor Matt Meyer praised Aternium’s work as an example of the innovation shaping Delaware’s future.
 “Aternium’s work represents the kind of forward-thinking innovation that will shape a healthier and more sustainable future for all of us,” Meyer said. “By investing in clean hydrogen, we’re not only supporting a Delaware company with incredible potential, but we’re also taking real steps to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment for generations to come.”

DSB Director CJ Bell emphasized the broader economic impact.
 “We are continuing to make significant investments in high-impact, high-growth companies to position Delaware as the Mid-Atlantic hub for innovation,” Bell said. “Supporting companies like Aternium is good for our state’s economy and our environment.”
Cottone said the funding validates Aternium’s mission and accelerates its progress. 
“We are grateful to the State of Delaware for this critical funding, which underscores the state’s commitment to innovation and clean energy,” he said. “This support accelerates our efforts to sustainably scale clean hydrogen production, strengthen our partnerships, and bring lasting economic and environmental benefits to Delaware.”
The anniversary event gathered strategic partners, elected officials, stakeholders, and members of the media to recognize Aternium’s achievements.

Wes Moore’s team is being promoted as part of a reorganization of the governor’s staff.
Emmanuel “Manny” Welsh will become principal deputy chief of staff and chief administrative officer. The move is part of a reorganization of the second floor offices of the State House by Lester Davis, Moore’s incoming chief of staff.
“Manny is a proven public servant with a deep well of expertise in the operations of government that’s vital to guiding Maryland through this unprecedented time,” Moore said in a statement.
“This moment is generationally defining for our state. We have a solid foundation to grow from as we diversify our economy to become less reliant on the federal government, but as that relationship changes, we need to ensure Marylanders continue to receive a high level of service from their state government,” Moore said. “His new leadership role will help ensure our agencies do just that.”
The changes announced this morning could be the first as Davis takes the reins as Moore’s new chief of staff.
“This will be an iterative process,” said David Turner, a Moore spokesman. “As Chief Davis integrates further with the team, roles and processes will adjust to ensure the administration better delivers at a high level for the people of Maryland.”

Welsh’s promotion takes effect Oct 15. Davis joins the governor’s office the same day. Welsh’s salary will be $202,000.
The model the office is moving to is relatively new to Maryland, though more than a dozen other states have similar organizational structures.
“Chief Davis brings his own experience and expertise to the role,” Turner said. “The model comes from his management experience in the City of Baltimore and at CareFirst.
“The Chief of Staff focuses on the most pressing strategic and political issues, orchestrates communications and political strategy, and manages upward to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor,” Turner’s statement said.
Davis, in his role, will serve as a gatekeeper to Moore — a traditional job for a chief of staff. Welsh, as second in command, will provide “executive-level oversight of state government operations,” Turner said.
“The Chief of Staff is responsible for the management, operations, strategy, policy, and external affairs of the Office of the Governor and the Moore–Miller Administration,” Turner said. “As the Governor’s highest-ranking aide and closest advisor, the Chief of Staff controls access and flow of information to the Governor, sets priorities, and ensures directives are executed across the Administration. All Deputy Chiefs of Staff will report directly to the Chief of Staff.”
Davis and Welsh take over at a time when advocacy groups, lobbyists, and others have complained over the last year that the second floor staff is unresponsive.
“The office of the governor takes seriously any critiques and suggestions for improvement,” Turner said. “Serving the state is a privilege, and during this unprecedented change in federal policy it’s vital the office adapts to the new environment. We’ll always look for ways to improve, as we have over the first two and a half years.”
Welsh’s promotion comes two weeks before Davis takes over as chief of staff.
Moore named Davis this month to succeed departing Chief of Staff Fagan Harris, who is leaving to become the president and CEO of the Abell Foundation in Baltimore.

Welsh will serve as “second-in-command” to Davis within Moore’s office. Welsh was one of several internal candidates for the chief of staff job.
He will also be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the office. As chief administrative officer, Welsh will work with Moore’s Cabinet and senior staff members. And he will continue overseeing Moore’s procurement policy and the Board of Public Works.
“This is a smart and timely decision as Maryland navigates changing dynamics with the federal government. By strengthening the Governor’s office with added structure, the administration will be able to respond more quickly and help agencies deliver critical services that meet Marylanders’ needs,” Kathy Hollinger, CEO of the Greater Washington Partnership, said in a statement provided by Moore’s office.
“Just as important, this model creates new opportunities to engage leading employers as partners — alongside government agencies — to ensure Maryland’s communities and economy remain strong,” her statement said. “This reflects the kind of forward-looking leadership this moment calls for.”
Moore, fresh off his 2022 election win, named Welsh as his liaison to the Board of Public Works.
Prior to that, Welsh worked for then-Comptroller Peter Franchot (D). Welsh, who was born in the Philippines, joined Franchot’s communication staff in 2015 and within a year, he was assisting the comptroller with the Board of Public Works. By 2020, Welsh was named Franchot’s chief of staff.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.  
The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said. 
“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”
Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said. 
Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.
“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”
Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.
“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”
Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.
Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.
“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”
Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.
Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.
“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”
Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction. 
“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

Mike Braun denied clemency to death row inmate Roy Lee Ward in an announcement early Monday morning.
“After carefully reviewing the unanimous recommendation from the State Parole Board, I have decided to allow the execution of Roy Lee Ward to proceed as planned for October 10,” he said.
Unless a court intervenes, Ward will be the third person executed since Indiana resumed capital punishment in December 2024, after more than a decade-long pause. Braun denied clemency for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, earlier this year.
The Indiana Parole Board last week recommended against granting clemency to Ward.
The five-member panel cited the “brutal nature” of Ward’s 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, emphasizing that Payne was conscious during the attack and her “final hours living with the injuries that Roy Lee Ward inflicted on her.”
“Candidly, this Board reviews thousands of cases a year, many with gruesome facts, but the victimization of Stacy Payne stood out to us,” wrote parole board chairperson Gwen Horth.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

Ward’s legal team has argued in court that Indiana’s current protocol creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain and suffering, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The inmate’s legal team continues to challenge the use of the drug pentobarbital, citing evidence that it can cause flash pulmonary edema and sensations of drowning. They point to Ritchie’s execution in May, when witnesses reportedly saw the inmate “lurch upward, as if to sit up, in a spasm” after the injection, a reaction they say is “inconsistent with the normal effects of unadulterated pentobarbital.”
In pending federal litigation brought by Ward, the Indiana Attorney General’s office confirmed last week that the Department of Correction has obtained “three sets” of pentobarbital.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said in a sworn declaration submitted to the Northern District judge that two of those sets will expire at the end of October and the third set expires in March 2026.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
State officials have not responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s questions about the amount paid for the latest three doses.
The state’s court filings also stressed that DOC is using “manufactured injectable pentobarbital” — not a compounded version — to carry out executions. Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
Ward’s attorneys proposed that executions could be carried out more humanely if DOC administered a “pre-dose” of fentanyl or another opioid before pentobarbital, but Neal said in his declaration that the department “does not intend to use fentanyl as part of carrying out the death sentence” and that it is not included in the prison’s directives.

Filthy bathrooms. It’s among the things retired law enforcement park ranger John Lauretig remembers about the last government shutdown. National Parks staff were furloughed, but the parks remained open from December 2018 through January 2019, leading to a human waste problem: There was a half-ton of human waste alone at Death Valley outside the restrooms when parks staff returned. 
That crummy situation may be a sign of what awaits many Californians soon if the government shutdown takes hold Wednesday, writes CalMatters’ reporters.
A shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to agree over how to keep funding the government’s discretionary spending, which includes bridge repairs, disease detection and more. The White House says to check an agency’s website to see how programs would be affected during a shutdown. Some workers are deemed “essential” and continue to work.
Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are mandatory programs that are excluded from the annual discretionary budget process, and, for the most part, should be unaffected by a shutdown. 
Congressional lawmakers must make a deal by Tuesday, 11:59 p.m. Democratic leaders want Republicans to undo the Medicaid cuts they implemented in President Donald Trump’s tax bill this summer and extend the federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act enrollees initially enacted under former President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Trump is floating the prospect of firing federal workers en masse should the shutdown occur. California is home to roughly 150,000 federal employees.
The National Park Service has lost nearly a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump’s return to the White House, according to an estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association. 
Read more about other government spending programs that could be affected in California during a shutdown, including air travel, disaster readiness and financial support for low-income families.

Protecting abortion providers

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a measure into law Friday that safeguards the identity of abortion providers in California. The law allows doctors, pharmacists and other authorized medical staff to prescribe abortion pills without putting their names or the patient’s name on the prescription label. It goes into effect immediately. 
Doctors in California and New York have been sued for providing abortion medication to residents in states where the procedure is not allowed.
The new law heightens the contrast between California’s abortion protections and laws in states like Texas, which heavily restrict or ban abortion, and allow their residents to sue out-of-state abortion providers.
Newsom said he was proud to sign the bill “in the face of amplified attacks on the fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”
The new law also requires state health insurance plans to cover the abortion pill even if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration yanks its approval.



Feds end tracking for food insecurity

From CalMatters’ health editor Molly Peterson:
California is showing alarm after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that it would terminate the nationwide Household Food Security Report. Nearly one in eight households statewide are food insecure, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, meaning that they lack the resources to ensure that everyone has enough to eat to support active, healthy lives. 
The survey is a “gold standard,” said Barbara Laraia, professor and chair of the UC Berkeley’s Food Nutrition and Population Health Program. Without it, policymakers, researchers and nonprofits relying on the 30-year-old report’s annual data to track hunger trends and allocate resources will be “flying blind,” said Mauricio Torres Jr., a spokesman for the Sacramento-based nonpartisan California Budget & Policy Center.  
State-level data efforts still can inform some local responses to hunger. UCLA’s California Health Interview Survey has tracked food insecurity for more than 20 years, identifying greater needs among low-income households, communities of color and immigrants.
But the USDA’s decision comes as county public health departments report to CalMatters that even the threat of losing federal funding is starving food stamp education and nutrition programs that could help Californians in need.



Tribal regalia for CA high school grads

From CalMatters K-12 education reporter Carolyn Jones:
Native American students will face fewer obstacles if they want to wear tribal regalia at high school graduations, thanks to a bill Gov. Newsom signed Friday.
Assembly Bill 1369 allows students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces, stoles and other regalia to graduation ceremonies without needing approval from the school district in advance. California already allowed students to wear tribal regalia, but at least half of school districts had pre-approval processes that some students said were overly cumbersome and arbitrary.

Assemblymember James Ramos, a San Bernardino Democrat and the bill’s author, in a statement: “Just acknowledging — once again — a student’s right to wear tribal regalia at high school graduation ceremonies is a far cry from early statehood, when California’s first governor called for a ‘War of Extermination’ against the tribes.”

Schools had said they need the pre-approval process to ensure that graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. The process applied to all students, not just Native American students, although Native American students were more likely to wear regalia.
Regalia, which is often bestowed by a tribal elder or family member, is a way to celebrate the accomplishments of Native American students and raise awareness of the culture, Ramos said.

On a quiet street near the marsh in Charleston, South Carolina’s Rosemont neighborhood, Luvenia Brown watches the weather reports more than she used to. She’s lost lawn mowers, bikes and outdoor furniture to the rising waters that have repeatedly crept into her yard.

Brown’s home is elevated, so the water hasn’t reached the interior. Not yet. But she’s deeply worried about what the future will bring.
“If the water continues rising the way it is, I don’t want to be here,” said Brown, 58, who works as a medical driver. “… I love my area. But I think my life is more important.”
Just a half mile to the south, a massive new development — expected to bring stores, offices and 4,000 homes — is springing up. Brown fears that all the new concrete and pavement will only make flooding where she lives worse.
Charleston is one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities — and one of the most flood-prone. As climate change prompts sea levels to rise and storms to grow more intense, this historic city has become a warning bell for what’s to come along America’s coasts: Some neighborhoods will retreat and others will be protected, and still others — often lower-income communities — may be left behind.

In Charleston, those futures are colliding. The city and the federal government are planning a $1.3 billion seawall to defend the iconic downtown peninsula with its regal, pre-Civil War mansions and majestic moss-covered live oak trees.
On Sept. 9, the City Council approved spending $2.5 million for continued design work and authorized an agreement between the city and Army Corps of Engineers. The city’s share of the total price tag is $455 million, reported The Post and Courier.
But under the current plans, the wall would not extend to lower-income neighborhoods like Rosemont, a historically Black community bordered by a freeway and hemmed in by industrial sites. That could leave those families more exposed than ever.
“I’ve seen how all those floodwaters demolish people’s houses,” Brown said. “I don’t think I want to be part of that.”
What’s happening in Charleston is playing out in dozens of coastal cities from New York to California.
Driven largely by sea level rise, flooding in the coastal United States is projected to occur 10 times more often over the next 25 years, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central.
An estimated 2.5 million Americans could be forced to relocate over the next 25 years, the group found.
The increasing floods are prompting insurance companies to raise premiums and decline policy renewals. In fact, ZIP codes in coastal South Carolina are among those with the highest insurance nonrenewal rates, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. All of that is likely to push some residents to higher, or drier, ground.
To understand how Charleston reached this tipping point — and what makes it especially vulnerable — you have to start with its geography.


https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Charlestondrone1b.mp4

Rising water, growing crisis
Built along the confluence of three rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, the city was founded on marshland and mud flats. Flooding there was once far less frequent.
But now, even an afternoon thunderstorm or an unusually high tide can overwhelm drainage systems and submerge streets.
The problem isn’t just more rain — it’s higher water. The sea level in Charleston rose about 13 inches over the past century. But by 2050, scientists project it will accelerate, rising an additional 1.2 feet. And by the end of the century, the water is expected to be about 4 feet higher than it is today.
The ground is sinking, too.
Charleston is one of the most rapidly subsiding cities in the United States, mainly because of groundwater pumping and the settling of natural sediments and filled marsh areas. That double threat — rising seas and sinking land — leaves the city increasingly exposed to flooding.
According to Climate Central’s Coastal Risk Finder, more than 8,000 people and 4,700 homes in Charleston County will be at risk of annual flooding by 2050, even under moderate climate action scenarios. By 2100, more than 60,000 people could be affected.
The Lowcountry, as this region is known, was always low. But now, it’s getting lower, wetter and harder to protect.
Rapid development, meanwhile, is paving over forests and wetlands that once soaked up stormwater. Every new subdivision and strip mall replaces absorbent ground with impervious surfaces — asphalt, rooftops, parking lots — that send rainwater rushing into neighborhoods like Rosemont.
The uneven fight against the sea
After Hurricane Matthew sent water surging over Charleston’s iconic Battery wall in 2016, then-Mayor John Tecklenburg and other officials consulted with Dutch flood experts, seeking to tap the know-how of a country renowned for its expertise in holding back the sea.

Charleston developed a comprehensive city water plan to protect itself while promoting resilient growth. Federal officials proposed an 8-mile-long, $1.3 billion seawall to shield the city’s historic peninsula from future storm surges and sea level rise.
The city’s share will likely be more than $450 million. Tecklenburg said that won’t be an easy sell. But to the former mayor, the choice is clear.
He told Floodlight, “If you give up the peninsula, you might as well head for the hills.”
But neighborhoods like Rosemont — just beyond the wall’s reach — will remain exposed. Parts of the neighborhood are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. And some fear the wall could actually make flooding worse in unprotected areas.
Skip Mikell, a longtime community leader in Union Heights, a historically Black neighborhood, stood at the end of Peace Street in Rosemont, looking out over a nearby marsh.
“In 70 years, where we’re standing, if nothing’s done, it’s going to be water,” Mikell said, adding: “The gentry of Charleston have connections, they have money, they have a voice. These communities are voiceless.”
The long road to retreat

 
About 12 miles northwest of downtown Charleston, a tranquil expanse of weeds, marsh grasses and black-eyed Susans stretches across what used to be a neighborhood. Bridge Pointe was once a compact community of 32 townhomes.
The site was returned to nature after the city and federal government bought out its flood-weary residents. But like many buyouts across the country, the process was slow and bureaucratic.
SC is buying out more than 200 repeatedly flooded homes. Here’s how the effort has gone.

John Knipper was among those displaced. Newly retired, he moved from New York to Charleston in early 2015, buying a three-bedroom townhome in Bridge Pointe for $172,000.
But just six months after he moved in, an August thunderstorm turned a nearby creek into a river. Several inches of water crept into his living room. Then in October 2015, a stalled weather system dumped more than 15 inches of rain on the region. His first floor was submerged under 2 ½ feet of water.
Over the next few years, the storms and floods kept coming. In 2017, FEMA authorized $10 million to buy out Bridge Pointe residents and their neighbors. By then, it had flooded four times, making the homes, Knipper said, “really unsellable.”
It took nearly four years after buyout discussions began for residents to get money for relocation. A typical buyout can take more than five years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office, meanwhile, found that there’s no national strategy for relocating people from flood-prone areas.
Building toward disaster
Just a mile away, many more homes are on the way.

Long Savannah, a massive new development, is expected to bring up to 4,500 homes. It’s one of several high-profile projects rising in flood-prone areas across Charleston County.
Like other mega developments planned for Charleston, Long Savannah will likely destroy wetlands, which work like nature’s sponges, soaking up rain and slowly releasing it to keep flooding in check.
Other massive developments on the books include Magnolia Landing, the 4,000-home project underway near the Rosemont community, and Cainhoy, a 9,000-home development that would fill wetlands on a low-lying peninsula near Charleston where flooding is already a growing threat.
“Charleston has a history of building in repetitively flooded areas,” said Robby Maynor, a climate campaign associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which sued to save some of the wetlands in the Long Savannah project. “We absolutely must stop building in low-lying and flood-prone areas to avoid making an already difficult situation even worse.”
Charleston city officials say they now require flood protections — such as higher elevation standards and better stormwater systems — for new buildings in flood-prone areas. But scientists and residents question whether those measures are enough, or whether building in risky areas simply shifts the danger to others.
“A similar story is playing out in cities all across the United States,” reports NASA’s Earth Observatory, “but the Charleston area stands out in one critical way — much of the new development has happened on low-lying land that is especially vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding.”
When leaving isn’t a choice
Ana Zimmerman and her husband bought their modest, one-story house on Shoreham Road — part of a close-knit neighborhood where neighbors looked after each other’s kids — in 2005.

Ana Zimmerman reflected in standing water July 29, 2025, near the site of her former home where she spent years dealing with flooding, ultimately moving to a new location and losing 12 years of equity. (Photo by Jeffrey Basinger/Floodlight)

The first sign of trouble came early one morning in October 2015. It was still dark when she put her feet to the bedroom floor, water lapping at her ankles. A powerful storm had overwhelmed the street.
Zimmerman rushed to save photo albums and the family cats, but the house suffered more than $80,000 in damages.
With the insurance payout and their own labor, the Zimmermans repaired the home.
But when Tropical Storm Irma hit two years later, Zimmerman remembers hearing neighbors screaming as 7 inches of floodwaters poured into her home — causing it to be declared a total loss.
Ultimately the couple abandoned the flood-damaged home and let it go into foreclosure, walking away from 12 years of equity.
They now live nearby in a house on an elevated foundation. Zimmerman, who calls herself an “unintentional flood activist,” has pressed public officials for stricter building rules and clearer flood-risk disclosures.
She says her experience is a “canary in a coal mine” for other low-lying coastal communities.
“Entire neighborhoods will have to move,” said Zimmerman, a college biology professor. “But the vulnerable among us, there will be no one there to help them, save them, and they will not be able to save themselves.”

Social Security and Medicare benefits will keep flowing in a government shutdown, but federal employees will be working without pay and delays likely will occur across many services.


John Lauretig remembers the filthy bathrooms, the overflowing trash cans and the community of people who rallied to clean up Joshua Tree National Park the last time the U.S. Government shut down. 
For more than a month from December 2018 through January 2019, thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed nationwide — but the Trump administration kept many national parks open.
Unsupervised, visitors drove through wilderness and historic sites, camped where they weren’t supposed to, and vandalized plants and buildings at parks across California. The trash — and the feces — piled up. In the days after the shutdown ended, park staff found at least 1,665 clumps of toilet paper littering Death Valley alone, where an estimated half-ton of human waste had been left outside the restrooms. 
“It was insane to leave the gates open and tell the staff not to show up in the park — for our public lands, and all of our special places in this country, to be unprotected,” said Lauretig, a retired law enforcement park ranger and president of the Friends of Joshua Tree nonprofit.
Now, facing the prospect of another imminent shutdown, conservation groups and retired park service employees including Lauretig are calling to keep the gates locked at national parks and historic landmarks. 
They’re among many Californians bracing for the shutdown, which is expected to begin Wednesday unless Democrats and Republicans can make a deal by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.   
As of now, the parties appear far apart, although President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are expected to meet today. Democratic leaders in Congress are demanding that Republicans reverse Medicaid cuts made in Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year and extend Biden-era subsidies used by a majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees. 
In response, the Trump administration has floated firing federal workers en masse if the shutdown occurs. 
“Democrats are hoping to use the one bit of leverage that they have left in Washington at this time to make it clear what they stand for,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego. “And the question is: Can they hold out against the political and policy pain that Donald Trump is hoping to impose by threatening more layoffs of government employees?”
The federal government shut down three times during the Obama and Trump presidencies. Each one presents a hardship for government employees, who are either furloughed or obliged to work without pay. 
About 150,000 federal employees work in California, not counting the military service members who also will go without pay during a shutdown.
In the past when facing possible federal shutdowns, the state had a contingency plan to try to avoid disruptions in certain services. In late 2023, it planned to pay one month’s worth of federal food assistance early to advance aid to families in the event of a shutdown.
But this year there’s no such commitment yet from the Department of Finance, as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration weighs the possibility of a lengthy shutdown. 
“There isn’t an open-ended long-term line of credit where the state’s general fund can be assumed to make up for any federal fund shortfall,” finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said.
Here’s a look at what Californians can expect to happen if a shutdown occurs this week. 
Social Security and health care
Most Californians shouldn’t worry about a federal shutdown impacting their Social Security benefits or their health care access in the near term. 
About 6.5 million Californians receive benefits through the Social Security Administration and those checks are expected to continue going out during a shutdown. 
But, customer service could suffer depending on how many employees are told to stay home, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. 
That includes “benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards. The level of disruption will depend on how many (Social Security Administration) employees the Trump administration deems ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ during the shutdown,” Max Richtman, the organization’s president, said in a written statement. 
Medicaid and Medicare, which pay for health care for low-income individuals, people with disabilities and seniors, are mandatory programs that are exempt from the annual appropriations process.
Jan Emerson-Shea, spokesperson for the California Hospital Association, said “essential services” like insurance payments to hospitals and doctors will continue. 
Some discretionary programs, however, like food stamps and benefits for women, infants and children may be impacted by a shutdown.
One group that could be disproportionately affected by even a brief federal shutdown are native and indigenous populations. Many of the 723,000 American Indians living in California get health care at clinics that are funded through federal grants. The clinics are often small and may have very little reserves to weather a funding pause, said Nanette Star, policy director for the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health. 
“Even a short shutdown can mean staff furloughs, service cuts, patient service delays,” Star said. 
Airports and travel
You’ll be able to fly and take rides during a government shutdown, but you might experience more delays. 
That’s because air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents are among the government employees who would be expected to show up for work without getting paid. The longer a shutdown drags out, the more likely it is that the system will strain and workers will call in sick. 
The U.S. Travel Association, which advocates for the industry, released a statement last week that included a survey showing many people would cancel or postpone travel during a shutdown, which it argued would ripple through the economy. 
“A shutdown is a wholly preventable blow to America’s travel economy—costing $1 billion every week—and affecting millions of travelers and businesses while placing unnecessary strain on an already overextended federal travel workforce,” said Geoff Freeman, the organization’s president. 
Wildfires and disasters
A federal shutdown won’t ground firefighters, but could slow the money that pays for future disaster prep. 
Nick Schuler, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, said the agency does not expect a shutdown to affect its “ability to respond to and aggressively attack fires” and will continue to operate as normal. In past shutdowns, he said, U.S. Forest Service firefighters have still been available for emergency response and pointed to California’s “robust Master Mutual Aid System,” which ensures resources respond regardless of jurisdiction.

Still, he cautioned that what keeps engines running today might not pay for the prevention work of tomorrow: “Any disruption to grant funding that supports fire prevention and wildfire resiliency could have negative impacts,” he said.
Newsom’s office said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would keep “core life-saving operations” going during a shutdown but that payments to states would stall and recovery efforts would be put on hold. That means Californians could see first responders in action but face delays in reimbursement or recovery projects.
Other science agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey could face interruptions that affect California’s disaster readiness, the governor’s spokesperson said.
National parks
National parks supporters are worried that the Trump administration again would send home workers but leave open the gates. 
That’s “a recipe for even more disaster,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications manager at the Center for Western Priorities, an environmental advocacy group. “It will be worse this time than it was last time around, simply because the parks are already struggling.”
She was referring to federal staffing cuts the Trump administration carried out earlier this year. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since Trump’s second term began, and left thousands of seasonal positions unfilled. 
If a shutdown does occur, the association projects daily losses of $1 million in fee revenue for the parks, and $77 million for the gateway communities that surround them. 
Morale among National Park workers is bad already — and a shutdown would make it worse, said Bernadette Johnson, a former superintendent of Manzanar National Historic Site, where during World War II the U.S. Government incarcerated thousands of Japanese Americans. 
“The attack has just been so furious. And I think that federal employees are being demonized, as these lazy bureaucrats that we are not … It breaks my heart to watch,” Johnson said. “The people left behind are holding all of that work now, because the work didn’t go away.”
A spokesperson for the The National Park Service said the agency is reviewing and updating plans for a lapse in funding.
However a shutdown may play out, Lauretig over at Joshua Tree said he’s ready.

Gavin Newsom will have to decide soon if renters can fight eviction if their Social Security checks are disrupted during President Trump’s second term,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom will have to decide soon if renters can fight eviction if their Social Security checks are disrupted during President Trump’s second term


With the Trump administration again threatening mass firings of federal employees, Gov. Gavin Newsom must soon decide whether California landlords must accept Social Security benefit delays as an excuse not to evict tenants who fall behind on rent.
Earlier this month, the California Legislature passed Culver City Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan’s Assembly Bill 246. The measure would give tenants legal protections in eviction proceedings if their Social Security benefits are “terminated, delayed, or reduced due to no fault of the tenant” and the federal problems caused them to miss rent.
Bryan introduced the bill this spring in the middle of the uproar over President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency campaign to slash the federal workforce and fears that Republicans would cut Social Security payments, which they ultimately didn’t do.
“It’s an assurance that if President Trump does come for our aunties and our granddads and our disabled brothers and sisters that California will be there to protect them and won’t let them slide into homelessness because their Social Security was cut off,” Bryan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July.
Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure. Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos declined to comment. He has until Oct. 13 to make a decision. 
Recent developments in Washington, D.C.could put fresh pressure on Newsom to sign the legislation. Trump’s top federal budget official, Russ Vought, sent a memo last week to the heads of federal agencies telling them to begin more mass firings of federal workers if the government shuts down because Congress can’t pass a spending bill. It’s not clear what Vought’s proposed cuts would mean for Social Security Administration staffing.
Democratic and Republican members of Congress are at an impasse on the government funding bill. Democrats are demanding Republicans restore billions of dollars of federal health care funding Republicans cut earlier this year. The federal government could shut down on Wednesday if they don’t reach an agreement.  Social Security payments haven’t been interrupted during previous government shutdowns. 
But the administration’s threat of more staffing cuts could pose a separate threat. 
This year, DOGE cut roughly 12% of the Social Security Administration workforce, contributing to backlogs at field offices around the country. Customer service problems at Social Security offices are still happening, The New York Times reported last week. 
What the bill means for California renters 
Roughly 6.5 million Californians receive Social Security benefits. It’s not clear how many of California’s estimated 17 million renters rely on the payments for rent. 
But older people eligible for Social Security benefits are an increasing share of renters. One rental market research company estimated that the number of seniors renting in the U.S. has climbed by 30% over the past decade, including a 31% increase in the Los Angeles area and a 24% spike in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The pending law would give renters in a court eviction proceeding the right to cite delays in Social Security payments to avoid being kicked out of their home or apartment. 
If a renter could prove the federal government was at fault for delaying benefits they use to pay rent, the court would be required to pause the eviction for up to six months. Within 14 days of the Social Security benefits being restored, a tenant would have to pay all past due rent or come up with “a mutually agreed upon payment plan” with their landlord. 
The pending law would be in effect until Jan. 20, 2029, the day Trump leaves office from his second term. 
Supporters include organizations advocating for the poor and disabled, such as California Council of the Blind and Disability Rights California.
“Due to recent actions by federal officials, including deep staffing cuts and office closures, any government program is at risk,” including Social Security, Eric Harris of Disability Rights California told lawmakers. 
The influential labor organizations Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association, which donate heavily to legislators, also support the bill. The two labor groups and their affiliate unions have donated at least $27.9 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

Opponents included the California apartment and building industries’ associations and the California Chamber of Commerce. In total, those three groups have donated at least $13.6 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
Republicans and some Democrats oppose
Debra Carlton of the California Apartment Association told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that any delays in rent prevent “senior mom and pop landlords” from paying their mortgages on time.
Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican representing the Sacramento suburbs, shared those worries with his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. He also noted that “President Trump, both in his first term, as well as in this term, has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to touch Social Security.”
“If the president is good to his word, this bill will do absolutely nothing,” Bryan replied. “But … Californians can’t afford to trust this president. He’s shown several times early in this administration that he is not good to his word.”
No Republicans voted for the bill as it made its way through both chambers. Two Democrats also were apparently leery of it and voted against their colleague’s measure – a rarity in the California Legislature. As CalMatters has reported, Democrats vote “no” on average less than 1% of the time.
Norwalk Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta cast the lone Democratic “no” vote for the measure on the Senate floor earlier this month. He didn’t explain his vote at the time, and a spokesperson didn’t return a message from CalMatters.
In the Assembly, Democratic member Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord also joined Republicans in voting against it when it was before her chamber the final time.  
In an interview last week, Ávila Farías, a former trustee of the California Housing Finance Agency, said was worried about the bill’s “unintended consequences.” 
“There’s the flip side of individuals in the business of being property owners,” she said. “They also have struggles, too, when they are not able to meet their monthly obligations.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/062822-For-Rent-Housing-Sac-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have been mostly fighting on their own.,"Guest Commentary written by

Blake Emerson
Blake Emerson is a law professor at UCLA.


The Trump administration’s assault on American higher education has recently been fixated on UCLA, where I teach administrative law and executive power. 
The White House has moved to cut off $584 million in federal funds for the university’s supposed failure to prevent antisemitism on its campus. It has demanded a penalty of almost $1.2 billion dollars, insisted that the university not admit “anti-Western” students, publicly disavow recognition of the transgender community, and end gender-affirming care at the university’s hospitals.
This a moment to stand up and fight. The University of California Regents must challenge the Trump administration in federal court. At the same time, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature must provide the UC system with the financial support it needs to stand for the rule of law and academic freedom.
The university has the law on its side. My colleagues and I drafted an open letter to the UC Regents explaining why the funding terminations were unlawful. Over 170 professors at UC law schools have signed it. The Trump administration has ignored the clear procedural requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 — such as the requirement that it provide for a hearing before an impartial decisionmaker before terminating funds, report to Congress and offer substantial evidence for its charges.
Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating UCLA’s funds. However, the Supreme Court has created jurisdictional doubts about this and other lawsuits, suggesting that some claims may need to proceed in the obscure federal Court of Claims. 
A suit by the regents in the Court of Claims would help to fill any gaps created by the Supreme Court’s unclear and evolving jurisprudence. It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have so far been fighting the university’s legal battle on their own.
These days the law is not always enough. Since the government has failed to provide due process, universities reasonably fear that failure to comply will only bring on more deadly funding cut-offs, and perhaps other forms punishment, such as loss of nonprofit status.
Given this climate of fear, the university and the state will need to partner to challenge the government’s illegal persecution. Newsom has already urged the regents to fight back against the Trump administration, asking, “How could you possibly accept this fine. Fine for what?” 
He’s right. But the university receives over $17 billion a year in federal funding, including $5.7 billion for research and program support. It would struggle to survive, much less maintain its status as a world-class research and educational institution, if all of those funds were withdrawn. 
Newsom and the state can help. Democratic lawmakers in California have proposed a ballot measure that would provide for $23 billion in funding for state grants for research. The proposal would leverage California’s unparalleled economic strength to check the Trump administration’s lawlessness. 
Faculty, staff and students know that we will bare serious burdens in a protracted legal battle with the Trump administration. But we cannot do it alone. We need the support of our state and of our fellow Californians.
California holds a unique place in the American mind — above and beyond the output of Hollywood. America would not be the same without that western boundary, where the endless and often destructive quest for imperial expansion once reached its limit.
If California succeeds, then the history of the United States can move forward on broad, sunlit beaches. If we fail, we may slip into a night made darker by the dimming of scientific light.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

This latest evidence of the opioid epidemic’s ongoing impact in New Mexico comes as the state ranks poorly on transparency in disclosing how it will use more than $850 million in opioid settlement funds, according to a OpioidSettlementTracker.com, a clearinghouse and accountability tracker for opioid settlement information created in 2019 by public health advocate and attorney Christine Minhee.

According to New Mexico state law, settlement funds must be primarily used to address the damage the drugs have done and to prevent future harms. But agreements the state made in the settlements do not require public reporting on how the money is spent or public input in spending decisions. According to the Opioid Settlement Tracker, New Mexico stands among a minority of states that earned a “0%” on its Expenditure Report Tracker, indicating the state has not committed to any public reporting of settlement fund spending. The data is based on research that included calls to the state and ongoing investigations of publicly available documents related to the settlements.
The Tracker notes that settlement fund spending is subject to examination by the New Mexico State Auditor’s office, but that the results of those audits are not made public.

By comparison, Colorado makes 100% of its opioid fund spending public through its Colorado Opioid Settlement Dashboard. Arizona likewise posts its state settlement allocations online. Wyoming, California, Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin and several other states have committed to making at least some state opioid spending public.  
Patrick M. Brenner, president of nonprofit think tank Southwest Public Policy Institute, pointed to the importance of public understanding of the settlement funds’ purpose in creating an environment of accountability. 
“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable,” he said, “so not as many people know to ask questions.”
The opioid settlements, which total more than $50 billion nationally, rank historically among the country’s highest-dollar public health settlements. Because states must use the settlement money for opioid remediation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health calls the settlements “an unprecedented opportunity” to address the decades-long opioid epidemic. States are receiving funds over 20 years from corporations including Johnson & Johnson, CVS and Walmart for their roles in creating, exacerbating and perpetuating the epidemic. 











“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable, so not as many people know to ask questions.”

New Mexico has been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. In 2023, the most recent data available, the state had the seventh highest overdose rate in the U.S. While overdoses overall in the state have been declining since 2021, a recent state legislative analysis notes lack of evidence “that use of fentanyl or other opioids has also decreased.” Rather, the decline is attributable to increased use of harm-reduction medication such as Narcan to counter overdoses.
In 2023, Santa Fe County Community Services Department rolled out a public awareness campaign related to fentanyl that included “Never Use Alone” messaging. The New Mexico Health Department recently reported a surge of overdoses in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Taos counties, possibly linked to increased amounts of fentanyl in the supply in the three counties.
“I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who just felt so blindsided [by opioid addiction]. They didn’t see it coming,” said Claire Carmony, a social worker and program manager with the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, which receives nearly 40 calls and texts a day from people across the state seeking help with addiction. “We get a lot of calls from concerned family members, loved ones, friends and community members that are impacted,” she said. “So opioid use disorder really has a big impact on our community as a whole, and people really struggle.” 
Accountability
New Mexico’s management of opioid funds has been called into question before. A brief published last year by the state’s Legislative Finance Committee called attention to contingent-fee legal contracts that wiped out nearly $250 million from awards the state won against pharmacies. The brief also pointed out the relatively short period the state has to pay those fees. 
“The lawyers received their money a lot faster than the state or local governments will ever get their money in,” Felix Chavez, a financial analyst and former LFC staff member who worked on the brief, told Source NM. “If [New Mexico] were to have the same payout structure that these attorneys did, a lot more could be done” to mitigate the crisis, he said. 
The LFC brief followed a 2023 opinion by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission after the Walgreens judgement, from which lawyers were paid $159 million of the state’s $500 million award. The SEC wrote that “several public bodies” were illegally sidestepping the state’s procurement code in making deals with outside law firms. In a 2023 statement, New Mexico Department of Justice Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez said the Walgreens legal agreements “contained no limit on fees.” She added that Attorney General Raúl Torrez had “instituted a new policy that sets strict limits on contingency fee cases,” though she did not provide further details about what those limits were. She also noted that even with lawyers’ fees, “New Mexico ranks third nationally compared to other states’ total settlements (including their attorney’s fees).”
Brenner said that while the state is required to spend the settlement money on addiction prevention and treatment, safeguards to ensure that happens are lacking. 
“Even if people are well-intentioned in handling these funds, they’ve got this relatively large infusion of money,” making accountability loopholes risky, he said. 
This summer, another LFC report showed that state programs for medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, which are funded by opioid settlement money, were underused and lacked outcome data. MAT, in which people with opioid and other substance use disorders are treated with medication, is among the most effective ways to treat addiction. 
Making a dent

Accountability notwithstanding, Josh Swatek, policy and performance director with the New Mexico Department of Health, calls the settlement funds “a game-changer.” He told Source NM that the funds allow for systemic advances in addiction prevention and treatment, including medications for incarcerated people; education in schools; harm reduction resources; and behavioral health services.
“Without the settlement funds we would have a much smaller scope,” Swatek said. “We wouldn’t have the link to harm reduction, and we would have less staff.” 
Brenner pointed out that despite the state’s failure to safeguard accountability in spending, cities and counties have worked to ensure the money is allocated properly. 
At a September meeting of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, Dona Ana County Health and Human Services Director Jamie Michael told legislators funds were being used for prevention and treatment, including ensuring availability of MAT in doctors’ offices and purchasing Narcan for first responders, state health offices and emergency departments to have on hand. She noted that in just the past month, four people had overdosed in the county, two of them fatally. “This seems like a lot of money over a long period of time,” she told lawmakers. “With all the needs, it’s not necessarily a lot of money.” 
Last year, Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque teamed up with global health nonprofit Vital Strategies to create a strategic plan for dealing with the crisis, which includes bringing prevention education to middle school students. “People are dying from drug overdoses,” said Dr. Wayne Lindstrom, Bernalillo County’s deputy manager of behavioral health, who echoed Michael’s emphasis on harm reduction to save lives. “How many deaths is too many?”  
Claire Carmony, a social worker and program manager with the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, says the organization receives numerous calls from people whose lives have been impacted by opioid use. (Courtesy photo)
Like Michael, Lindstrom emphasized how important it is to be “laser focused” when allocating settlement funds. “People hear about these large sums of money and they get the perception that this is really a significant investment,” Lindstrom said. “Bottom line is that $2.2 million is not going to make a significant difference relative to the scale and scope of the problem overall,” he said. 
With the Trump administration’s Medicaid cuts, poor transparency could make opioid funds vulnerable to diversion to other uses, said Brenner. Even if the state is well intentioned, “the absolute top level right thing is to make sure that these monies are only spent on what they are meant for—not plugging Medicaid budgets.”
Nationally, the final chapter in the opioid lawsuits is underway. In June, states across the U.S., including New Mexico, agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family.
The Purdue settlement will likely infuse the state with additional resources for prevention, treatment and recovery. Rodgriguez declined to comment on New Mexico’s likely share, but states with similar populations like Nevada and West Virginia have announced expected funds in excess of $50 million over 15 years. The funds’ impact remains to be seen. “We never seem to have the resources that approach equivalency relative to the extent of the problem,” Lindstrom said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/douglassachagettyopioid-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)To mark “10 years of impact,” the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has issued a report highlighting key research on a wide range of Utah issues over the last decade. 
The report commemorates the 10-year anniversary since the institute’s doors first opened in September 2015. 
The man that the institute was named after — prominent business man and community leader Kem Gardner — said these words 10 years ago at an event celebrating its launch:
“I believe firmly that this policy institute can make life better for our state and for our children,” the Deseret News reported at the time.

From data on the COVID-19 pandemic, to research on housing affordability and the shrinking Great Salt Lake, Kem C. Gardner researchers have “emerged as Utah’s premier source for economic, demographic, and public policy research that guides community leaders and helps policy makers” make informed decisions, the institute said in a news release announcing the report Thursday. 
“Over the last 10 years, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has proven to be indispensable to achieving the University of Utah’s goal of creating positive impact,” University of Utah President Taylor Randall said. “The Institute provides trusted data, rigorous analysis, and forums for sharing ideas, contributing significantly to our mission of generating unsurpassed societal impact.”
The 10-year report includes key findings on some of the biggest issues that Utah has — and continues — to face. They include: 

Data and analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic
Long-term economic and demographic projections informing the state’s population growth and resulting changes.
Challenges with housing affordability and how Utah compares to other states.
Economic impacts of the 2034 Olympics and how Utah must prepare.
Research on the adverse effects of the shrinking Great Salt Lake and data to inform water management decisions.

While it highlights past research, the report also looks ahead. It lists seven reasons — what researchers described as the “magnificent seven” — that make up a “constellation of economic achievements that sets it apart from the rest of the nation.” 
Those include, according to the report, economic diversity, high household income and low poverty, high upward mobility opportunities, a “relatively equal distribution of income,” a well-trained and educated workforce, a fast-growing and young population, and high levels of social capital and strong community bonds. 
Researchers, however, also listed what they called “Utah’s troubling seven,” or challenges that could spell trouble if they go unaddressed. 
They included: 

Housing affordability and homelessness: “Utah’s housing market has become increasingly unaffordable, leading to a rise in homelessness and limiting access to homeownership for many,” researchers wrote. With a median sales price of a single-family home hitting more than $548,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, Utah ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the U.S., according to the report.


Traffic congestion: The state’s growing population has “strained Utah’s transportation infrastructure,” the report says, “resulting in significant traffic congestion and reduced quality of life.” 


Public education: A “concerning number” of Utah third graders are not proficient in reading, researchers wrote, with only 46.7% of Utah third graders scoring proficiently on the RISE test, a state-mandated standardized test. 
Higher education: Compared to other states, Utah’s college and university enrollment and graduation rates lag behind other states, “limiting the potential of its workforce and economy,” the report says. 





Great Salt Lake: The lake’s declining water levels continue to “pose significant environmental, economic and health risks to the state,” researchers warned. 


Energy supply: Due to growing energy demand, constraints on supply and the need to transition to cleaner energy sources, Utah “faces potential energy deficits,” the report says.
Behavioral health: Like the rest of the nation, Utah is seeing a “growing behavioral health crisis, requiring a greater access to mental health and substance abuse services,” researchers wrote. 

To address those issues, researchers also listed the “starting seven,” or ideas to “serve as a conservation starter for a statewide dialogue” on the state’s biggest challenges. 

For housing affordability, they recommended the creation of a “statewide community land trust.” 
For traffic congestion, they urged prioritization of “connected autonomous vehicles.” 
To increase third grade reading proficiency, they encouraged education leaders to “place a reading pro in K-3 classrooms.” 
To improve higher education graduation rates, they recommended the expansion of “catalyst centers” into Salt Lake City. 
For the Great Salt Lake, they recommended the conservation of 250 kilometer acre feet (KAF) to 500 KAF each year. The KAF measurement refers to a thousand acre-foot, or a unit of volume representing 1,000 acre-feet of water. It’s commonly used to measure water in reservoirs, rivers or snow pack. 
For energy, they encouraged investment in the state energy research fund. 
For behavioral health, they said to “align behavioral health efforts and investments with Utah’s strategic plan.”

The Alabama Sentencing Commission estimates that the state prison population could reach up to 28,000 inmates by 2030, due to new punitive laws passed by the Alabama Legislature.  (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Sentencing Commission said Friday that Alabama’s already overcrowded prisons could see inmate populations rise by nearly a third by 2030 due to new punitive laws passed by the Legislature.
The commission, working with Applied Research Services, a research firm that studies criminal justice, estimated the population in custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections could grow from 21,753 to between 24,000 and 28,000 inmates, depending on the number of people that the ADOC admits each month on average.
Those numbers, if reached, would come near or exceed DOC’s record inmate population, set 16 years ago. They would also further strain the state’s General Fund; the state’s prisons have taken up an ever-larger share of the budget over the past two decades.

“The system, even before all the changes that happened, was already trending up,” said Bennet Wright, executive director of the Alabama Sentencing Commission, on Friday. “All the things that I discussed, and that is not to say they are good or bad, but they are going to adjust the track up more.”
Wright said the projections factor  several changes implemented by the Alabama Legislature, from increasing the number of judges assigned to oversee cases to changes in statute related to split sentences, to a law passed in 2023 that further restricted the use of good behavior to reduce incarceration time.
Wright and the researchers said there are some uncertainties that are embedded within the simulations.
The long overcrowding crisis
Alabama has struggled with prison overcrowding for decades, and the crisis has been a major contributor to violence in correctional facilities. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state in 2020, saying the conditions in men’s prisons violated inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment.
The state’s prison population fell after 2015 after the Legislature approved a series of sentencing reforms, dropping from about 26,300 in 2013 to 20,200 in 2018. It fell still further during the COVID outbreak in 2020, when Corrections temporarily barred the admission of new prisoners. The population was about 18,300 in 2021. Since then, the number of people in ADOC has steadily increased, going to 20,500 in 2022, 21,000 in 2024, and is currently at 21,753 for the year.
But the simulations run by the commission projected that the population would increase.
Even the lowest figure generated by the simulation estimates the population of people in custody of ADOC in 2030 would increase by 31% from a 2021 baseline of 18,300. The highest projected population, 28,000, by the end of the decade means that the prison would increase by more than 50% from the baseline.
Many of the estimates from the simulations predicted the prison population to be higher than the 26,500 in 2009, the highest number of people ever incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
Multiple estimates
The Sentencing Commission provided people who attended the presentation with multiple estimates instead of a single measure incorporating all the factors because of the uncertainty inherent in the model. One element that was not incorporated into the simulations to provide the estimate was the average number of people admitted into ADOC each month.
“The idea about the number of people coming in the front door has to be an independent determination,” Wright said.
One reason is that the number can fluctuate dramatically. The rate was more than 800 in 2018, but it is currently about 450.
“I know what you are thinking,” Wright said. “Well Bennet, look to the past. Well, that is the past, what part of the past do you want me to use?”
The composition of the ADOC admissions could also change depending on the laws enacted by the Legislature. When lawmakers enacted into law a rule that made the sentencing guidelines presumptive, fewer judges sent people to prison.
So instead of incorporating the admission rates for ADOC into the model, researchers calculated a population estimate by assuming a given rate for the number of people admitted into ADOC custody.
The lower estimate of 24,000 assumed that about 400 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month. The higher estimate of 28,000 assumed that 500 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month.
Contributing factors
Wright highlighted several changes that were factored into the model. One was that the Legislature increased funding to provide the judicial system with more judges, allowing more cases to be processed, which potentially adds to the number of people sentenced to prison.
Another factor is changes to statute enacted by the Legislature for split sentences. In the past, most cases in the criminal justice system required judges to apply split sentences once defendants were convicted.
“You either had to get probation or a split sentence,” Wright changed. “So now, everything is back on the table.”
The split sentence law was also changed.
“So even if someone is split, the split sentence law is amended to allow for longer sentences on splits,” Wright said.
The Legislature in 2023 reduced the amount of credit people in prison could receive on their prison sentences for good behavior. Prior to passing the law, people classified in the second tier could receive up to 40 days of credit for every 30 days served. SB 1, sponsored by April Weaver, R-Brierfield, reduced it to 15 days for every 30 days served.
“They reduced general good time and they reduced access to maximum good time as well,” Wright said.
Along with that, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles updated the guidelines they used to determine whether to grant an applicant parole.
All those changes factor into the prison population. Wright and researchers provided two numbers for every rate that people are admitted into ADOC custody. Wright said the three factors that drive the trend between the high estimate, and the low estimate are the percentage of people who will receive a split sentence, the parole rate, the number of people in prison who will be subject to the updated correctional incentive time laws versus the previous set of rules.
“With a high percentage of splits, high parole and a higher percentage of people coming in on good time, you would expect a prison population in five years of about 24,000,” Wright said.
The complement of that, with low numbers on split sentences, parole and good time allocation, that figure increases to about 26,000 if ADOC admits an average monthly rate of 400 people into the prisons.
“Look at what we historically do in Alabama,” Wright said. “Policy-wise, we do not have sustainable, slow growth, or slow decline. We typically have very accelerated growth, or very accelerated decline.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Flag-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

NapierAt the University of Michigan, seven more charges were handed down last week against pro-Palestine students and alumni.
These latest disciplinary charges represent a decision by University of Michigan (UM) leadership to double-down on its strategy of seeking to repress campus pro-Palestine activism. Beginning in November 2023, when former University President Santa Ono called in police from multiple jurisdictions to barricade his office building against students seeking to meet with him, the University has sought to repress students calling for divestment from Israel rather than engaging with them. 
This strategy of muscle over mediation was on full display in May 2024 during the forceful early morning police clearing of UM’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment, when students were sprayed with chemical irritants and their tents were ploughed by heavy machinery. In addition to being dragged through University disciplinary proceedings, student activists have been surveilled, banned from entering classroom buildings, followed off campus, and smeared in various all-university communications. 
University of Michigan denounced for using private investigators to surveil student protesters

Most recently, the art exhibit organized by pro-Palestine UM student activists as part of a weeklong “Freedom School” was kicked off of University grounds by the University’s Division of Public Safety and Security.  
Revealingly, some of those charged in recent months through the University of Michigan’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) and the new Office of Student Accountability (OSA) are members of the Encampment 11. These UM students and alumni successfully defeated Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s political charges in May, but they are now facing disciplinary probation, suspension, and re-enrollment bans for actions that Nessel declined to prosecute. These actions by University of Michigan leadership not only chill expressions of dissent on campus, but discourage the moral conviction to call out a genocide that is unfolding before the entire world.

Yet even as the University sinks to new lows in its repression of pro-Palestine student activism, resistance is spreading on campus in subtle yet new and important ways. 
Just last week, on September 19, University of Michigan faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and community members organized a vigil to honor the lives of Palestinian health workers. Standing across from the University’s Central Campus, vigil participants read the names, ages, and occupations of over 1,200 Palestinian health workers killed during the genocide in Gaza. Those reading names during the 4-hour vigil included a renowned poet and literary journal editor, a children’s book author, a senior faculty member in computer science and engineering, and the director of a local arts institution, among others. 
Standing with the readers were faculty and staff who are active in a variety of campus labor unions and in faculty government. Representatives of local faith communities joined in solidarity with multi-religious prayer offerings.  
And this spirit of resistance – against institutional efforts to direct public attention away from the genocide in Gaza – expanded and gained momentum on the University’s Ann Arbor campus over the weekend of September 20 and 21, when Doctors Against Genocide (DAG) convened its Second Annual Conference at the University of Michigan Medical School. 
Throughout the two days of conference sessions, several hundred participating doctors and medical students explored strategies for anti-genocide awareness raising within medical institutions, discussed their own experiences of practicing medicine under conditions of genocide, and heard the live-streamed testimony of doctors providing medical care in Gaza amidst the massive Israeli military assault now underway. 
Participants and visitors entering the lobby of the Biomedical Sciences Research Building encountered a massive three-dimensional model that visualized the destruction of all aspects of civilian life in Gaza. And alongside this cartography of genocide stood a wall of posters prepared by medical students that detailed the timeline of attacks on Gaza’s shelters, hospitals, universities, schools, cemeteries, archaeological sites, mosques and churches, fields and orchards, greenhouses, water wells, bakeries, and aid distribution sites.

A key message of the conference was that the systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare sector has critical consequences for the population and is itself an instrument of genocide.
Medical doctors are generally not known for being overtly political. But Doctors Against Genocide has been on the forefront of raising public awareness about genocides in Palestine, Sudan, Congo, Tigray, and elsewhere. For two days, UM’s medical campus was invigorated by the presence of physicians wearing white coats with DAG’s red logo printed across the back, who had come together to share best practices in medical care and public advocacy for those suffering the catastrophic health consequences of the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
Equally significant is the fact that organizers of the vigil and organizers of the DAG conference worked together to plan their events. Medical faculty and medical students participated in the Friday evening vigil. Likewise, UM faculty and students from outside the Medical School participated in the DAG conference that took place over the days that followed.

This intentional effort to bridge the divide between the medical side of the University and the traditional faculties of literature, arts, sciences, as well as other professional schools is important, because it builds on the critical vote by the UM Faculty Senate in May 2023 to unite faculty governance across campuses, including the Medical campus, where Michigan Medicine employs a large share of clinical professors.
With the already-urgent situation in Gaza worsening and a U.N. Commission confirming that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians, UM faculty are coming together in an effort to remind the entire University of Michigan community, including its top-tier hospital and Medical School, that we must act with intention and with courage before there are no more Palestinians in Gaza to protect. 
This is not to suggest that UM faculty in the past have been silent. Over the past two years, UM faculty and staff have found various ways to criticize the University’s heavy-handed efforts to silence pro-Palestine student activists’ calls for university divestment. 
For example, the University’s proposed “Disruptive Activities Policy” was widely condemned by faculty in March 2024, who criticized it for targeting student activism and curtailing First Amendment rights. The following semester, more than 1,300 faculty voted in November 2024 to pass a Faculty Senate motion censuring the University of Michigan Regents and calling on them to “cease the use of surveillance, policing, physical violence, and legal power as mechanisms to silence speech.” 
Over the past two years, the UM Ann Arbor Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has repeatedly issued statements critical of the University’s actions to curtail pro-Palestine student activism on campus. Moreover, as State Attorney General Nessel’s office moved forward with prosecuting student activists, faculty and staff participated individually in court support. And University of Michigan Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) was established with the explicit aim of providing support to pro-Palestine student activists facing repression.

Yet at the beginning of this academic year, something different is happening. The jointly organized vigil and DAG conference indicate a growing awareness among UM faculty that their role need not be confined to supporting students. Indeed, UM scholars and clinicians alike are coming to understand that they have their own role to play beyond supporting students. Faculty feel empowered in a new way to channel their own skills and training towards the task of calling out the University’s silence – and thus its complicity – concerning the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 
This represents a new approach for faculty in terms of how they understand their roles, both professionally and as citizens, in relation to the genocide in Gaza. It suggests that the sort of faculty-led resistance that took place earlier this year in leading opposition to the closure of the University’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion might be spreading into new areas. In both of these examples, faculty mobilized around their vision of what the University’s mission entails, regardless of what central administration asserts it to be. 
Prayers and a solemn reading of names may not be what people initially think of as resistance. However, at a time when violence and repression seem to be worsening, and even the mention of Palestine or genocide draws ire, creating the discursive space on campus to collectively bear witness to the sacrifice of doctors saving Palestinian lives is momentous. In the present moment of unprecedented attacks on higher education, insisting on a set of values for the university community to uphold and then putting those values into practice is at its core an act of resistance. We need more of this kind of resistance.

As someone whose paycheck depends on widespread reading, I approve this.
But I’m not sure the people overseeing Alabama’s libraries like it very much. And I think it’s because they’re frightened of literacy.
Literacy is much more than the ability to read. Literacy is what results from repeatedly exercising that skill with a wide range of books. Learning. Empathy. A broader understanding of the world and the people in it.
The Alabama Public Library Service Board does not seem to like that.
I can’t think of another explanation for why the state board keeps dragging members of Fairhope Public Library’s governing board to Montgomery. A handful of belligerent cranks are wasting the library’s time whining about books, mostly those with LGBTQ+ characters in them.
The Alabama Public Library Service considers this a priority.
Board member Amy Minton, who also happens to be running as a Republican state Senate candidate, introduced a resolution over the summer to classify as inappropriate “any material that promotes, engages, or positively depicts transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders.”
Quick aside: Gender-affirming care leads to better lives for people with gender dysphoria. I’m putting that here in case the state board prevents you from reading it in a library.
But zealots don’t want to have a reasoned discussion about care options and outcomes. They want fear and silence.
Gender ideology is so important that library board members earlier this month decided they would personally review the handful of outstanding complaints about books on Fairhope’s library shelves.
Which brings us to “gender ideology.” And this question: What the heck is “gender ideology?”
Is it affirming the dignity of transgender people? Acknowledging their existence?
Is it showing curiosity about the nature of gender — how much is innate and how much is societal?
Or is it the understanding that people of all genders are inherently equal and deserving of equal opportunities to live their lives as they see fit?
It could be one of those things. It could be all of those things. The Alabama Public Library Service, in constant terror of ambush by fictional LGBTQ+ characters, gets to decide.
And forgive me if I expect the worst possible outcome from that.
Remember that book-banning advocates started in Prattville by conflating books acknowledging the existence of transgender people with sexually explicit material. That was patently false. But it gave Alabama politicians leashed to the far-right the chance to pretend there was a problem where none existed.
And once they got that inch, they went for the mile. Librarians, of all people, must now carry out their duties knowing they could be served up as fuel for the far-right outrage machine.
To its credit, Fairhope fought back. When the board cut the library’s funding, private donors stepped up to support it. City leaders have expressed support for their library. Fairhope voters largely rejected a slate of pro-censorship city council candidates last month.
I hope the rest of the state is paying attention. Fairhope’s fight is a fight for dignity, curiosity and common decency. Three values that the Alabama Public Library Service and many state leaders appear to consider dangerous and illegitimate.
It’s a fight for actual literacy.
Not just the ability to read basic words, take orders and pass a test. But the process of consuming and processing rational ideas. Of encountering new ways of seeing the world and one another.
Some of the hardest work we do is understanding another person. It’s almost impossible without the narratives that books provide. Without broad access to those stories, society becomes static. Hidebound. Hateful.
And sure, teachers need resources to teach kids to read. But we all need libraries where trained professionals can stock diverse, rational and challenging books. Once you start tying their hands, you give Alabamians a limited, counterfeit version of reality.
It’s like restricting a musician to performances in C major. Or ordering a painter to use a single color palette. Or requiring football teams to run just three plays. You’re cutting off a world of possibility.
That’s what our state library board is trying to do. Make sure that children growing into reading get a stunted and deeply prejudiced view of the world. Where the only aspirations are conformity and obedience.
And that’s the opposite of literacy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

Falls are the leading cause of death for Americans 65 years of age and older, and are responsible for more than 30,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Nevada Health Care Association represents assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. It did not respond to requests for comment on the report’s findings.
Nationally, 43% of nursing home falls involving Medicare patients are not being reported, according to the report. In Nevada, 60% of nursing home falls were not reported. The rates for failure to report ranged from a low of 21% in South Dakota to a high of 64% in Washington, DC., followed by California with 61%. 
The data, which is supposed to be provided to the government by nursing homes, is used for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Care Compare website, which is intended to provide consumers with quality of care information. 
Failing to report “leads to inaccurate fall rates on Care Compare,” the report says. Facilities with the lowest fall rates on the government website were the least likely to report, suggesting that “low fall rates for nursing homes on Care Compare are likely driven by nursing homes’ failure to report falls, rather than an actual low incidence of falls.”
A large, nonprofit nursing home with more than 200 beds in New York had a 5-star overall rating on Care Compare, the highest possible, and reported three falls with major injuries that required hospitalization. The Office of Inspector General, which wrote the report, found the nursing home had 13 falls.
“Providers may have a disincentive to report events, such as falls, that could result in lower scores on quality measures,” says the report. “Previous analyses by OIG and others have identified under-reporting by providers.”
The report is based on data from falls reported to have occurred between July 2022 and June 2023. The OIG found: 

For-profit, chain nursing homes, and larger facilities failed to report falls most often;
Nursing homes failed more often to report falls of younger residents, male residents, short-stay residents, and residents with only Medicare coverage; 
Reporting of falls was worse in “nonrural” nursing homes; 
Most falls involved the oldest residents, and the percentage of unreported falls (38%) was lowest among those 85 years and older;
The percentage of unreported falls was highest (55%) among those younger than 65 years, who qualified for Medicare because of disability or end-stage kidney disease.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/long-term-care-getty-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

Here's a look at how candidates are chosen and how challengers qualify for a primary.","Connecticut’s Democratic primary election in 2026 could become uncharacteristically competitive, with several well-known incumbents drawing potential challengers for their seats. 
Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to launch his run for a third term as Connecticut’s chief executive, watched this summer as Josh Elliott, a progressive Democratic legislator, announced plans to primary him.
Meanwhile, more than four Democrats — including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest — have announced plans to try to unseat U.S. Rep. John Larson, who has represented Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District for nearly three decades.
Many of the would-be challengers are already honing their messages and raising money in preparation for what could become bruising political battles. 
But just because someone announces a campaign on social media doesn’t mean they will be in contention during the primary next August. 
In Connecticut, political candidates — especially those challenging sitting incumbents — need to clear several hurdles just to have their name listed on the ballot.
Here is a look at how parties choose their candidates and the steps challengers need to take to qualify for a primary. 
How do candidates make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut? 
There are several ways for statewide or congressional candidates from a major party to make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut.
The two easiest paths run through the political party conventions, which are gatherings of top Democratic or Republican officials.
Anyone seeking a statewide office or a congressional seat will have their name added to the primary ballot if they receive enough support from the convention delegates, who get to vote on which candidates the party should endorse.
The person who wins the party endorsement automatically gets onto the ballot.
But Connecticut’s election laws specify that any candidate who also receives at least 15% of the votes during a round of balloting at the convention will automatically qualify for the primary. That means challengers can make it onto the ballot even if they don’t receive the party’s stamp of approval.
For those who don’t get a spot on the ballot at the conventions, the third way to throw their name into contention is to petition their way into the race by collecting enough signatures from eligible voters to qualify for a primary race. 
When are the conventions and who are the delegates?
The statewide party conventions in Connecticut, where delegates vote to endorse candidates for governor and other statewide offices, are held in the spring ahead of the party primaries in August. 
The same is true for the congressional conventions, which are separate events where party delegates from each of the five congressional districts in Connecticut choose who will serve as the party-endorsed candidates in primaries for the U.S. House.
The delegates at those conventions are made up of Democratic and Republican party members from each of Connecticut’s 169 towns and cities, and it is largely up to the local Democratic and Republican town committees and the local party chairs to determine who those delegates are.
The delegate selection process is one of the reasons that critics argue the system is set up to benefit party insiders and tamp down political upstarts. 
If you succeed at the convention, you can begin to campaign instead of spending money and time collecting signatures.
What happens if candidates fall short at the convention? 
If a political candidate can’t rally enough support from the party insiders at the convention, there is another way to keep their campaign alive. But the road to the primary gets a lot harder for those people.
That’s because candidates who are snubbed at the convention need to gather thousands of signatures from voters who are registered with their political party. 
Connecticut law requires candidates for governor and congress to obtain signatures from at least 2% of registered party members in the state or in their congressional districts in order to qualify for the ballot. 
In a Democratic primary for the 1st Congressional District, for instance, that threshold would currently require candidates to collect roughly 3,700 signatures. And in a Democratic gubernatorial race, it would obligate a petitioning candidate to secure roughly 15,800 signatures from registered voters, based on current voter registration numbers. 
The bigger hurdle, however, is the timing of those signature drives. The law specifies that petitioning candidates have just 42 days to pound the pavement and collect all of the necessary signatures.
What does a petitioning candidate need to do?
Plenty of candidates have shown that it is possible to run a successful primary campaign without the support of their party’s delegates.
Bob Stefanowski, for instance, gathered more than 9,000 signatures from Connecticut Republicans in 2018 in order to qualify for a crowded gubernatorial primary that year. 
Today, the 42-day window would require a potential Democratic gubernatorial challenger to collect more than 370 signatures per day from registered Democrats, based on current voter registration numbers.
State law requires those signatures to be collected in-person by people who are registered in Connecticut with the correct political party.
And when the signature drives are done, the petitions need to be notarized and turned over to the registrars of voters in multiple towns for each signature to be verified.
That means that some signatures can be tossed if the people who signed the petitions are not properly registered with the party, or if there are duplicate signatures. 
All of that sets up a hectic month-and-a-half-long race for petitioning candidates to earn their spot on the primary ballot.
What are the arguments for and against the ballot access laws? 
Supporters of Connecticut’s ballot access laws argue that the current rules enable the two major political parties to vet the candidates who are going to be running for office under their banner. The rules also ensure that anyone who makes it onto the ballot has a least a nominal level of support from party members.
Critics of the system, however, argue the state’s laws only serve to empower party insiders and to protect incumbent politicians from potential challengers.
Each state has their own unique requirements that specify how candidates can place their names onto primary ballots. Many states, for instance, allow people to make it onto the primary ballot simply by paying a filing fee. 
Opponents of the system in Connecticut have argued repeatedly that the state’s rules for ballot access are some of the most restrictive in the country.
Muad Hrezi, who attempted to challenge Larson in a 2022 primary for the 1st Congressional District, made that very argument in state court after he failed to gather enough signatures to advance his campaign that year. 
A state superior court judge overseeing that case, however, rejected the argument that the state’s laws were overly burdensome and unconstitutional.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The two candidates vying to become New Jersey’s next governor have insisted transparency would be a guiding value in their governing, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill unveiling a “transparency agenda” earlier this month and Republican Jack Ciattarelli bragging in speeches and on social media about how transparent he is.
But criminal justice reformers fear both candidates could slash public reporting on law enforcement, making policing in New Jersey less transparent just as the federal government increasingly expands its policing authority in states and cities.
Jason Williams, a justice studies professor at Montclair State University, noted that neither candidate has offered a detailed plan to expand police transparency.
“Jack Ciattarelli has aligned closely with law enforcement groups and has even suggested narrowing public access to police internal-affairs records, a step community advocates view as moving backward,” Williams said. “Mikie Sherrill, by contrast, has rolled out a broad ‘transparency’ platform, but her proposals focus mainly on fiscal and budgetary disclosure rather than on police discipline or use-of-force records. Both positions ultimately work to uphold the status quo.”
President Donald Trump’s cuts to police transparency — including his January revocation of former President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating body cameras and a misconduct database for federal officers — should spur policymakers to strengthen transparency at the state and local levels, said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project.
While New Jersey voters have consistently cited the economy and taxes as the primary issues that drive them to the polls, police transparency also should be top of mind for voters, Bonds said.
“Police officers, more so than most other government officials, have incredible power in our society. They can literally kill you on the street before you have a trial, before you’re charged with a crime. They have the authority to take your money without due process. They have the authority to come into your home without due process,” Bonds said. “So even if you aren’t from a community that’s regularly impacted by over-policing or police violence, it’s incredibly important that we know who is doing those things in light of how much power they have.”
Ensuring police transparency is especially important, Bonds said, as Trump has dispatched military troops and federal officers to Democrat-led cities and ordered the hiring of thousands of new officers to enforce his deportation policies.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill are both vying in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

Sherrill’s spokespeople declined to make her available for an interview.
Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, has said little publicly about police transparency. During a recent talk with a police union, a Metuchen police officer asked her to defend her yes vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was aimed at racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement. Sherrill told him she opposes “any ability for people to go after individual officers,” but supports accountability in police departments.
“So I do believe if there is a systemic problem, whether it’s at the municipal, county, or state level, that there should be accountability there. And I should think — I do think that if there — I think I agree with all of you, that if there are bad police officers, if there are structural problems in police departments which make every police officer look bad, that should be addressed and police should have accountability for that,” she said.
During that talk, she also said she supports civilian review boards as long as they do not have subpoena powers.
Ciattarelli, who recently landed the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police’s endorsement, told the New Jersey Monitor after a town hall in Pitman earlier this month that he would scale back on reporting of police use of force and require reporting only on incidents in which officers fire a gun. He would not commit to continuing to report on major discipline and the names of officers involved in fatal encounters, transparency measures that then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordered in 2020.
Jack Ciattarelli said he wants to scale back reporting on when police use force. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“I’m going to go by the way of my attorney general. I’m going to sit and talk with the attorney general about these things,” he said. “But let me say this — we are not going to demoralize these men and women in blue. They’re trained professionals. We’re going to let them do their job.”
He added: “I don’t know how much more transparency you can have when somebody’s wearing a body cam.”
On his campaign website and in social media posts, Ciattarelli has also said he would end the release of internal affairs records, opposes civilian review boards “with or without subpoena power,” would appoint a “pro-police” attorney general, and would protect qualified immunity to shield officers from liability for actions they take on the job.
Williams said New Jersey’s next governor should not weaken police transparency at a time when residents have deep concerns about police brutality and controversial police-involved fatalities.
Citizens should be alarmed at any plan to eliminate use-of-force reporting except when an officer fires a gun, Bonds said.
“That’s an arbitrary distinction. Obviously, we’re aware of so many situations of really extreme brutality that don’t involve the discharge of a firearm,” she said, pointing to George Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes, while Garner died after a New York City cop put him in an illegal chokehold.
Law enforcement agencies should, at a minimum, publicly release officer misconduct records, substantiated and unsubstantiated civilian complaints, departmental policies, and footage captured by body-worn cameras and dashboard cameras, Bonds said.
Keeping those things secret hurts both the public and the police, she added.
“It hurts the public by depriving them of information, by leaving them in the dark about what happened to people they care about. It takes away information they need to advocate for policy changes,” Bonds said. “It’s not beneficial to police agencies to not be transparent either. We see this time and time again: If the public doesn’t have information, they’re going to fill in the gaps with what they know.”

Failure to comply would lead to a loss of school funding.
HB 43, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Pike Road, would have to be approved by voters in a statewide election if it passes the Legislature during the 2026 session, which begins in January.

Ingram said in a phone interview on Thursday that the amendment aimed to allow students to practice their religion.
“This is just to give [students] the option to be able to fellowship with other students who are Christians,” he said.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama said in a statement Friday the proposed amendment violates the First Amendment.
“The U.S. Constitution allows for students and school employees to engage in private prayer during the school day, but students and school employees cannot be compelled, coerced, persuaded, or encouraged to join in prayer or other religious activity,” A’Niya Robinson, director of policy and organizing at the ACLU of Alabama said. “HB 43 is not only unconstitutional but also creates a hostile educational environment for students who do not adhere to state-sanctioned religious practices.”
Nik Nartowicz, lead policy counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that works to defend the right to freedom of religion, said in a statement Friday legislators cannot enforce religion in schools.
“Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation means that students and their families – not politicians – get to decide if, when and how children engage with religion,” the statement said. “This bill would advance Christian Nationalists’ agenda to impose their religion on public schoolchildren,” Nartowicz said.
The amendment, if passed, would require students to have a signed consent form in order to participate in prayer and the reading of religious texts. If students have not consented to prayer and reading, it cannot be done in class.
Ingram said students who have given consent will be sent to a different classroom to not interfere with teachers’ instructional time.
Schools that have shown a “continued pattern of intentional refusal” will be investigated by the Alabama Department of Education and could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld.
“Some schools may not want to do it or put it to a vote for the students in their school system, so this is just where the school systems have to act on it and the board members have to vote on it,” Ingram said. “Even if it’s voted up or down, a position has to be taken. So if it’s voted down no money is going to be withheld.”
The proposed amendment to the state constitution would also mandate that each public school vote on whether to say the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the day.
“Right now, it’s in the school policy to where you have to have the pledge, but a lot of schools are not doing the pledge. They’re not complying with the law, and that was a bill that Speaker Ledbetter passed years ago,” Ingram said in a phone interview Friday.
Any school that does not vote on whether they will say the pledge at the start of the school day, or does not say the Pledge of Allegiance after voting to say it, could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld. However, funding can be restored upon complying with the law.
“We don’t want to cut any school funding, but we want to make sure that they comply with the law and that they put it up to a vote of the school board within 60 days,” Ingram said. “If they vote yes, they have to comply and keep doing it every day, and if they vote no, they don’t have to do it.”
Robinson said forcing students to recite the pledge is harmful to their rights.
“Students should have the freedom to recite (or not recite) the pledge, and withholding school funds as enforcement further threatens that freedom that our country defends,” she said in a statement Friday.
According to Ingram, students have a choice on if they want to say the Pledge of Allegiance or not.
“It’s not mandatory for every student to stand up and hold their hand over their heart, especially if they’re not a U.S. citizen. We’re not making them do that, but the teacher has to have it as an option to do,” he said in a phone interview Friday.
Reed filed a similar bill for the 2025 legislative session, but the bill was postponed indefinitely.

Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat, is running to be Georgia’s next governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAt least one more Democrat is jumping into the race to be Georgia’s next governor.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a public policy consultant, once made history as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives and the first Palestinian American to be elected to any public office in the state back in 2022.
Now, the Duluth Democrat is entering the race for the highest state office in Georgia, competing against Democrats like Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who was once a Republican.
Romman’s platform includes raising Georgia’s minimum wage, reopening shuttered rural hospitals, ensuring that children have enough to eat, and investing in the state’s small businesses. What sets her apart from the other Democratic candidates, she argues, is her willingness to embrace change and try something different.
“I firmly believe the politics of old aren’t working,” she said in an interview. “The business as usual isn’t working. And if we want to change the power dynamics of our state, we have to do something different.”
Romman, who worked for organizations like the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, and the Georgia Muslim Voter Project before running for office, also recently launched a statewide campaign called Project 159 with the goal of recruiting organizers and volunteers in every Georgia county in response to a similar grassroots effort from Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Mike Collins.
As the Democratic Party of Georgia gears up for the 2026 election cycle, Romman said, she hopes to see the party stick to a set of shared principles, such as advocating for people over corporations.
“We can build a broad coalition while holding on to our values, because they are popular values,” she added. “What Democrats actually believe in are very popular with voters, whether it’s raising the minimum wage, whether it’s expanding Medicaid in our state, whether it’s restoring access to abortions and life-saving care.”
Romman, who is currently the only Palestinian American in the Georgia Legislature, also gained national attention during last year’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when she was floated as a potential speaker on behalf of the Uncommitted Movement, which sought an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. The DNC ultimately denied the group’s request for a speaking slot, and Romman delivered her speech at a protest that was held outside the convention. The speech was later published in Rolling Stone.
Throughout her campaign, she said she hopes to carry a message of optimism for voters who are dissatisfied under current political leadership.
“I think right now, the greatest challenge we are having is this pervasive sense of cynicism and nihilism,” she said. “And in order to overcome that, you have to build a vision. You have to work towards big goals.”
While she acknowledges that some may see her bid for governor as a long shot in a Republican-dominated state like Georgia, she argued that an economic-centered campaign can motivate voters to turn out for progressive causes.
“To be clear, yes, this is a state that is predominantly Republican controlled, and has been for over 20 years,” she said. “But I think if you set a high bar, and you build towards a vision, and say, ‘look, let’s work towards this together, let’s build a movement, let’s imagine what’s possible,’ that kind of hope-centered, movement-centered campaign can go a really long way in our state.”
The winner of next May’s Democratic primary will go on to face the Republican nominee in the general election next November. The GOP primary is becoming increasingly crowded too, with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger recently launching a campaign for governor. Other high-profile Republican candidates include Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Attorney General Chris Carr.

[…],"The Washington state Capitol on Nov. 11, 2024. (Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A contentious new sales tax on services that Democratic state lawmakers relied on to pay for Washington’s latest budget is set to take effect Wednesday. 
Senate Bill 5814 is one of the biggest moneymakers used to bring in an estimated $3.6 billion over the next two years to fill a shortfall in the operating budget. This law is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds.
But a key piece of the new tax law is in question. 
Cable juggernaut Comcast believes the measure’s sales tax on advertising services is illegal and is suing to get it overturned. The state attorney general’s office is expected to respond to the lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court in the coming weeks. It could be months before a judge weighs in on the provision’s future.
The tax on advertising services is specifically expected to bring in roughly $475 million over the next four years. It’s unclear what would happen to collections made under the new tax if the law is later ruled invalid, a state Department of Revenue spokesperson said.
A block on the tax would throw a major kink into the $77.8 billion budget passed after months of negotiations in the Legislature. The next 60-day legislative session begins in January. 
The law earns the state money by applying the retail sales tax to more services. Beyond advertising, it covers temporary staffing ($833 million over four years), security ($127 million), live presentations ($360 million) and information technology ($189 million), among others. Temporary staffing services hospitals use are exempt.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with affected businesses. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects this will have on their bottom line. 
The law also adds taxes on emerging nicotine products, like Zyn pouches, which don’t kick in until Jan. 1. Some other tax increases Democrats approved this year, including to Washington’s primary business and occupation taxes, also take effect on New Year’s. 
Also starting Wednesday, financial institutions with an annual net income above $1 billion will have a business and occupation tax they pay raised from 1.2% to 1.5%. During the session, Democrats estimated this would impact about 200 firms. 
The business and occupation rate for service businesses with a gross income over $5 million is increasing from 1.75% to 2.1%.
Republicans universally opposed this Democratic-backed package of new and increased taxes and fees. 
All of these proceeds go into the state’s operating budget, which funds the bulk of Washington’s state government programs and services. 
The budget for transportation is separate. 
The $15.5 billion two-year transportation budget approved this year also relies on a slate of new and increased taxes and fees, namely a rare gas tax hike implemented in July. 
These transportation funding streams are estimated to bring in $3.2 billion over the next six years to fund Washington State Ferries, highway megaprojects, maintenance of state roads and bridges, Washington State Patrol and public transportation.

A few transportation-centric fee hikes also begin Wednesday. 
The $9 annual fee for driver’s licenses and IDs is going up a dollar, a move expected to bring in $74 million over the next three budget cycles. The 50-cent capital vessel surcharge paid by state ferry riders is also increasing. This is projected to raise $47 million. 
And the latest transportation budget removes an exemption from tolls for public and private transit buses, vans, and rideshare vehicles on bridges. That’s worth $6 million over six years.
Further transportation revenue measures take effect throughout 2026.

It’s a standard for how institutions should operate when people come forward about sexual assault and exploitation.
Nearly eight years after the #MeToo movement forced a national reckoning — and years after the horrific scope of Jeffrey Epstein’s network came to light — Indiana keeps confronting local headlines that remind us how far we still have to go. From City Hall to the Statehouse to our own workplaces, women continue to report harassment and abuse, only to face doubt, retaliation, or bureaucratic processes that prioritize liability over safety.
Recent investigations into harassment complaints in Indianapolis’ city government made that painfully clear, describing behavior that was “professionally inappropriate” and a culture that must change. That should be a turning point, not a footnote.
The stakes are not abstract. Indiana has some of the highest rates of sexual violence in the country. According to statewide data, about 60% of Hoosier women report experiencing sexual violence in their lifetimes, and roughly one in three have been raped. Those numbers are staggering—and they represent the people we care about most—our coworkers, neighbors, students, parishioners, and friends.
We also sit at the crossroads of human trafficking. Law enforcement data show a growing number of identified cases across our state, underscoring the need for coordinated prevention, survivor services, and prosecution strategies. Host city selection often emphasizes hotel capacity, travel accessibility, and entertainment infrastructure, but rarely prioritizes whether a city is prepared to address concerns related to trafficking. Yet those very characteristics — plentiful lodging, robust transit, and nightlife — are the same that traffickers exploit. Studies show traffickers may also take advantage of travel visas by disguising victims as spectators or luring women and girls with promises of legitimate jobs only to coerce them into
illicit activity once they arrive.
Senate Democrats elect new minority leader after second round of sexual harassment accusations

Believing women is not enough. We must commit to building systems that actually protect them. That starts with Indiana law. Today, our statutes still contain gaps — particularly around consent — that make it harder for survivors to seek justice. Women4Change supports closing loopholes and modernizing definitions so the law reflects lived realities, not outdated
assumptions. This includes addressing forms of sexual assault that exploit coercion, impersonation, and power imbalances.
While policy is important, we can’t dismiss the role of infrastructure to support women when at their most vulnerable moments. The federal Violence Against Women Act provides critical funding for crisis response, shelters, legal assistance, and prevention. We need to ensure those resources reach communities equitably and are paired with trauma-informed practices in schools, universities, workplaces, and public agencies. Survivors should not have to become expert navigators of a fragmented maze to be kept safe at work or school — or to find a counselor, get a protective order, or keep their job while healing.
And we must talk plainly about money. Violence is not only a safety issue; it’s a financial one. Survivors lose wages, housing, jobs, and childcare. That’s why Women4Change uplifts tools that help people rebuild economic security — like FreeFrom’s survivor-centered resources that offer cash assistance, employment protections, and practical steps to stabilize finances and plan for long-term safety. Dignity is hard to sustain without dollars.
Finally, we must recognize that culture change also requires accountability in where we work and how we govern. Public institutions need survivor-centered reporting processes, independent investigations, guaranteed non-retaliation, and transparent timelines. Training for managers and elected leaders on bystander intervention, trauma-informed response, and legal obligations cannot be a one-time event — it must be consistent and ongoing. And when patterns emerge, leadership must act swiftly and publicly. Silence isn’t neutrality; it’s complicity.
But accountability cannot stop at policy; it must also adapt to the realities of a digital age where exploitation is increasingly enabled by new technologies. National data underscore this shift: in 2021, 85% of sex trafficking cases filed in U.S. Federal Courts involved the Internet as the primary method of solicitation. This reflects a longer trend: between 2007 and 2012, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center found that in most pimp-controlled prostitution incidents — one of the most prevalent forms of sex trafficking—the forced sex acts were advertised or facilitated online. These patterns make clear that without vigilance, traffickers will continue to weaponize emerging tools and platforms, exploiting every gap in oversight.
At Women4Change, our commitment is twofold: advancing policies that center on survivors and connecting Hoosiers with concrete help. If you or someone you know needs support, we’ve compiled Indiana-specific information on consent and sexual assault, along with links to statewide partners such as the Indiana Coalition to End Sexual Assault & Human Trafficking, crisis lines, and legal resources.
Indiana can lead. We can be a state where survivors are believed, where laws reflect modern realities, where City Hall and every workplace are safe, and where healing is matched with real economic security. But that will only happen if we demand it —consistently, across party lines, and with the courage to examine our own institutions.
Believe women, and then build the systems that prove it.

Mike Braun, left) and Commerce Secretary David Adams sit during an announcement on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Secretary of Commerce David Adams remains both CEO and president of Indiana’s controversial Economic Development Corp. — five months after lawmakers directed Gov. Mike Braun to split the roles across two appointees.
But that’s expected to change next month, according to the Commerce Office.
“We have been evaluating the role of president and anticipate an announcement by the end of October,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
The changes were tucked into Senate Enrolled Act 516, an economic development law that also created an entrepreneurship office on Braun’s behalf, plus established land notification and other transparency requirements for the IEDC.
Immigration cooperation, IEDC limits and more nab concurrence votes, head to governor

Until Braun’s May 1 signature, the secretary of commerce was required to be the agency’s CEO and president. But legislators crossed “and president” out of Indiana Code.
They added: “The governor shall appoint the president of the (IEDC), who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. The president shall report to the secretary of commerce.” The edits were effective immediately.
Throughout the summer, however, Braun’s administration didn’t name an appointee to serve alongside Adams or offer specifics on a timeline, despite the Capital Chronicle’s repeated requests for information.
The Commerce Office’s Thursday statement didn’t include responses to questions of whether the administration was aware of the changes, the reasoning behind them or about the delay in compliance.
The law’s author — Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon — said the idea came out of collaboration with Braun’s fledgling administration. The governor took office in January after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s eight-year tenure.
“We worked with Secretary Adams and his staff, the governor’s office and the Legislature,” Buchanan said. “We all worked cooperatively, essentially, to come up to try to set up the best structure for IEDC to be successful.”
Splitting the roles, he said, allows “a little more focus,” to “build on our strengths and improve our weaknesses, and really dedicate the time it needs in order to to make sure we’re successful.”
The changes reset the provision to its original form.

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code.
IEDC was established with two leaders, according to the 2005 law, House Enrolled Act 1003. They were merged in a 2021 law, House Enrolled Act 1418, under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Under Braun, the roles are going back to the original design.
“I did ask that question about, ‘Does it need to be statute, or can it be administratively done?'” Buchanan recalled. “And I was told it is something that needs to be statute.”
The appointment will come within weeks of the release of a report about the IEDC and its partners.
Braun launched the investigation in May, after Indiana Legislative Insight’s April publication of allegations like self-dealing and side gigs.
The troubled agency, its foundation arm and several frequent collaborators were each dubbed an “entity of interest.” The analysis, conducted by Washington, D.C.-based FTI Consulting, took about four months — less than the year allotted in the $800,000 contract.
Braun led IEDC’s board in a unanimous approval of the report’s release at a Wednesday meeting. It’s undergoing legal review for redactions but is already driving new policies on investment, board voting and beyond.
That was the board’s second gathering in its new form. Braun remade it in June, replacing Holcomb’s eight selections with nine new appointees.
He has vowed to reform the quasi-public agency to increase transparency.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The headlines over the past few weeks have been unrelenting. The Trump administration is activating the full power of the federal government against perceived enemies, from liberal groups to elections officials to the former FBI director.
Meanwhile, autocratic powers like China and Russia are running influence campaigns and cyber attacks to pit Americans against Americans. China currently has the ability to track Americans’ locations and unencrypted communications on American telecom networks, as well as movements and communications abroad, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. Russia has been perfecting the art of social media influence, with apparently great success in the case of President Donald Trump’s first election.
China and Russia want to crack the idea that we are a rainbow of many colors, a multiracial, multi-faith, representative democracy where we respect each other and celebrate our diversity in all its joys. They know America is weaker domestically and on the world stage when we are fighting against each other, both online and in the streets. 
The more we hate each other, the more our fabric of American government pulls apart and frays. While I strongly disagree with Charlie Kirk’s message and its impact on marginalized groups, political violence is always wrong and is a dynamo that is hard to stop.
Here in Minnesota, we had one our toughest summers since 2020. House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their beloved golden retriever Gilbert were assassinated. It’s only by luck that State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette survived the assassin’s bullets, and that the killer failed to harm the dozens of other leaders on the kill list.
One of my closest friends was on the first page of the kill list. It’s scary. It’s easy to be anxious and paranoid. I have been threatened at my own home.
The only way to defeat us if the Trump administration and the movement that undergirds it manages to divide us. We can’t let that happen. To win as a majority coalition, we must always invite everybody who believes in civil liberties and human rights.
In a time when the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, labor allies, and the left needs to be organized, there is an ongoing rift between factions of the DFL Party. 
In Minneapolis, the party convention’s endorsement for mayor of state Sen. Omar Fateh was appealed to the state party and invalidated. This did not end the question. If anything, it made each intra-party faction feel ever more strongly that the opposing side was corrupt and self-dealing at the expense of the greater Democratic project.
Minnesota has been a shining eight-pointed North Star, strong on civil liberties, human rights, and economic opportunity. Gov. Tim Walz recently announced that he is running for a third term. There is an open U.S. Senate contest with U.S. Senator Tina Smith retiring from public service next year. This is a real opportunity to earn back a DFL trifecta with two legislative majorities and the governor’s signature pen. The stakes are high.
Keeping a big tent party unified in these times is incredibly difficult. I know first-hand as the former chair of the DFL local party unit that trained the most volunteers and raised the most funds of any DFL local party unit statewide. But this commentary isn’t about water under the bridge.
This November, voters in Minneapolis and Saint Paul will elect city leaders for the next four years. The first Tuesday of next February, thousands of DFL members will gather in the cold night for precinct caucuses. We will host yet more intra-party contests at in-person conventions across the state of Minnesota. It will get nasty. There will be hurtful language that threatens the inclusiveness of our party. How we react and lead will decide the path forward.
Words matter. Actions matter more. We on the left side of the spectrum — from moderate Democrats to liberals to leftists — have a role to play to invite Minnesotans into the greater Democratic project. You can invite your friends to a virtual training. You can attend the “No Kings” protests across Minnesota on October 18. You can register your family to vote where they live so they can vote in elections that affect the community they call home. 
And you can give family, friends and random people online a little grace. There are plenty of bots trying to gin up conflict, and real humans like us don’t have to add to that.
We are in the real fight against fascism now, here, in America. If you thought Joe Biden was using rhetorical hyperbole when he said in 2019 that there was a battle for the soul of this country, well, we are here now. 
The words we use and the actions we take will have significant consequences over the next months and beyond. Majorities are only built with addition, not subtraction. To help make it happen, you can get involved, bring your friends, make calls, knock doors, write postcards, protest, and exercise our First Amendment rights to protect the Fourth Amendment rights and all the rest they are coming for. 
We can do this, but only if we do it together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237397769.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

“It's a big deal that this is happening,” said state Sen. Ruth Hardy, while adding “I don't think it's going to solve the entire problem.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
When Rita Munro settled in Middlebury in 2016 to start a family, friends sent her spreadsheets of contacts for child care facilities across the county and encouraged her to get on waitlists as soon as she became pregnant. 
“It takes an incredible amount of executive function,” said Munro, 37, who works as a therapist. 
The word-of-mouth culture stemming from competition, particularly for home child care facilities, could be challenging for newcomers, she said, and the Covid-19 pandemic only intensified the situation. Eventually, she managed to find spots that worked for her kids.
In the coming months, Munro’s 2-year-old daughter and newborn twins are planning to attend the newly expanded and renovated Otter Creek Child Center in Middlebury. The organization’s $12 million transformation has been in the works since 2017.
“I think everybody’s excited,” said Linda January, the center’s executive director. “We’re ready to be in the building.”
The expansion will nearly double the program’s capacity, making it one of the largest child care providers in the state. The construction is expected to end by mid-November, January said, and comes during a period of growth for child care in Addison County. Local leaders said increased offerings in the area come none too soon, as a recent influx of public money to child care provides an opportunity for recovery from Covid-era hardship.
The new facility at Otter Creek Child Center is set to include a spacious, multistory addition to the original building, as well as a new expanded parking lot, several playgrounds, an elevator and a full commercial kitchen, January said. Though unfinished, the new rooms were beginning to bear hints of their future purpose on Friday, with cubbies taking shape in some spaces and miniature bathroom amenities in others.

The center plans to add up to 15 new teachers by next fall, in addition to several other operational positions.
“During the pandemic, Addison County lost more child care slots than any county in the state,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison.
A 2022 analysis by the Burlington child care nonprofit Let’s Grow Kids found nearly 70% of infants likely to need care in Addison County did not have access to any regulated child care programs. Fifty-four percent of toddlers were in the same predicament, the report estimated.
Although Otter Creek will experience a huge jump in available slots — from its current daily maximum of 70 across two temporary locations to 139 in the single renovated building on Weybridge Street by next fall — there are currently 250 people on the waitlist, January said.
“It’s a big deal that this is happening,” said Hardy. “I don’t think it’s going to solve the entire problem.”

‘We fixed the business model, to an extent’
The two largest sources of funding for the expansion project were capital and land gifts from Middlebury College, the county’s largest employer and the project’s “biggest partner,” according to January, and congressionally directed spending from the office of former U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Middlebury College’s contributions add up to more than $5 million, and Leahy’s office earmarked more than $3.5 million via Let’s Grow Kids. 
The child care center is still actively raising funds, January said, but does not anticipate any substantial, lingering debts. New levels of public support, in combination with her organization’s new structure, have given January confidence in the center’s financial outlook. 
According to Aly Richards, CEO of Let’s Grow Kids, the heart of Vermont’s child care problem historically lay not in initial capital for projects but rather in their long-term sustainability.

Act 76, which passed in 2023 via a veto override in the Vermont Legislature, commits $125 million annually to the state’s child care system in part via a .44% payroll tax. Families making up to 575% of the federal poverty level were newly eligible for tuition subsidies that year, and the state began paying out those subsidies at higher weekly rates.
“We fixed the business model, to an extent,” Richards said. “The money goes specifically to parents, who now can … better afford child care, and to early educators, who can have more resources to actually run their program.”
The state has seen 1,700 new child care slots and more than 100 new providers open since the act passed two years ago. Previously, more programs were closing than opening each quarter, and low pay combined with poor benefits made retention and hiring difficult, Richards said.
Under the new funding system and with a larger organizational scale, January said she has been able to increase the center’s salary floor to $20 per hour and add a retirement plan. Staff also now have vision and dental insurance, but health insurance coverage, while “more feasible,” is still a future goal.
January said the majority of the families she serves receive some tuition coverage, which can be equally transformative.
Without the subsidies Munro stands to receive, her cost for child care would exceed her take-home pay each month. While her husband, David, also works as a professor at Middlebury College, Munro may have needed to quit her job without tuition assistance.

“Our taxes are high,” Munro said. “We invest a lot into our school systems, so it makes sense to be investing a lot into early early child care.”
The impact of well-funded child care on the health of the state’s workforce should not be understated, Richards said. 
“There’s a massive return on investment for our economy and for businesses,” she said.
Otter Creek Child Center is not the only recent expansion to the Addison County child care landscape. The Red Clover Child Center in Middlebury’s congregational church, The Growing Tree in Addison and other providers have sprung up in the area over the past two years.
Michelle Bishop, who runs The Growing Tree, previously worked for the state’s federally funded Head Start program and observed the intense demand for child care providers through that job. Her program opened last month with a capacity of 20 and is still on a shoestring budget to some extent, she said. 
Bishop said it would not have been financially possible to open the center without public assistance from Act 76. Roughly 80% of her attendees receive tuition assistance through the program, which gives the organization some stability.
“It’s not a profitable thing,” she said. “That’s not the point, but it will keep itself alive.”
Hardy said projects like Bishop’s and January’s are a huge step forward for the county, as both a public service and a driver for the local economy. She said Vermont’s new funding provisions make the state a national leader for child care. 
“We’re very much on the cutting edge,” Hardy said.

On Tuesday, voters in Arizona elected Adelita Grijvala to Congress to fill a seat vacant following the death of her father, Raúl Grijalva. Both Grijvala, a Democrat, and her Republican opponent had said they would sign a discharge petition to force the House vote.
The petition needs 218 signatures — a majority of the House — to bring a resolution sponsored by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, to the floor. The resolution would lead to a vote on a bill requiring the Department of Justice to “publicly disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell,” Epstein’s longtime associate now being held in federal prison.
So far the petition, which Massie co-sponsored with U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, has 217 signatures — every Democrat in the House, including U.S. Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City and Wesley Bell of St. Louis — and four Republicans.
Rep. Mark Alford, right, introduces himself to Douglas Walther, left, before the town hall on Wednesday at the Lions Club in Harrisburg. An NPR tally reported that around 37 of the 219 U.S. House Republicans held town halls during the August recess (Aiyana Massie/Missourian).
Only U.S. Rep. Mark Alford of Raymore among Missouri’s six Republicans told The Independent how he would vote for the measure if it makes it to the House floor. While he opposes the discharge petition, he said, if the bill it seeks to advance comes up for a vote, he will support it.
“The Epstein case has cast a long shadow over our institutions, fueling distrust among Americans,” Alford said in a statement sent by email. “By releasing the files, we can begin to ensure justice for the victims and restore faith in our criminal justice system. Transparency is not a partisan issue; it’s a moral one.”
Alford said he was opposed to the discharge petition because it doesn’t allow for measured consideration of legislation.
“The discharge petition process bypasses regular order, skips the committee process, and prevents the people’s elected representatives from having a say until an up or down floor vote—that’s wrong and is not how our legislature should operate,” Alford said.
The only other Republican member of the Missouri delegation to respond to an inquiry about the discharge petition was U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner of Ballwin. Her emailed statement did not say whether she would vote for the measure if it reaches the floor or why she had not signed the petition.
“As I have strongly stated previously, Jeffrey Epstein was evil and I hope he rots in hell for what he did to so many innocent children,” Wagner said. “I have called for total transparency, to the extent the courts will allow, and ensuring victims are always protected.”
Wagner said she has voted in favor of investigations by the House Oversight Committee and that has already resulted in the release of thousands of documents.
“Any criminal activity must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Wagner said.
Seven days after the 218th signature is recorded on the discharge petition, any member who signed can call for House Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule a vote on the petition, which must come within two days.
The tumult over releasing records related to the Epstein investigation has created turmoil in Congress all summer. His death in 2019 in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors has become the focus of many of the questions surrounding the case.
In 2007, a plea deal with then-federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta, who went on to be secretary of labor in the first Trump administration, ended an FBI investigation into Epstein. He was accused, the Miami Herald reported in 2018, “of assembling a large, cult-like network of underage girls — with the help of young female recruiters — to coerce into having sex acts behind the walls of his opulent waterfront mansion.”
Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida for procuring and soliciting minors for sex, and served about 13 months in jail under a work release arrangement.
President Donald Trump and his supporters, including some now working in his administration, dealt in conspiracy theories for years on the information surrounding the Epstein case, including whose names turned up during the investigation and the circumstances of his death.
The clamor for more transparency in the case, especially about Trump’s friendship with Epstein, has resulted in various attempts by Republican leaders in Congress to keep a lid on rebellious members.
In July, Johnson, the house speaker, sent members home early for their August break because of the pressure to release the files. 
And at home in Kentucky, Massie told reporters he and the other three Republicans who signed the discharge petition are being pressured to remove their names following the election of Grijvala.
Johnson and “some of the powers that be in DC are in full panic right now” about it, Massie said, according to reporting by Semafor.
The other Republicans who have signed are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.
“They asked some of my colleagues who are co-signers,” Massie said. “And they actually threatened them politically, not physically.”
Among the Missouri delegation, The Independent did not receive responses from the offices of U.S. Reps. Sam Graves of Tarkio, Jason Smith of Cape Girardeau, Bob Onder of Lake St. Louis or Eric Burlison of Springfield.
The Independent could not find any sources for statements by Graves at any time on the Epstein files.

Smith, in a statement reported by KRCG in July, said more documents should be unsealed.
“The more transparency we can have the better,” Smith said.
In a July panel discussion on right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice, Onder said the delays in releasing full details of the Epstein investigation are a symptom of “this idea that ‘deep state’ insiders control the levers of power.” 
Epstein used influence to escape justice, Onder said.
“I think it’s very much the question of whether, if you’re wealthy enough, powerful enough, well-connected enough, you can get away with anything,” Onder said.
In an interview with Missourinet in July, Burlison said the American people are “sick and tired of being lied to by their government or the government holding these secrets that they deserve to know the truth on.”

A lawsuit filed Friday in Cole County Circuit Court alleges state lawmakers unconstitutionally split residential property into different classes, choosing which counties would get a cap, and how much, on “simply the whim of individual legislators.” 
The bill was passed by lawmakers during a special session in June.
The bill’s funding for sports stadiums — up to $1.5 billion intended to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri — was already in court. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday morning on a motion by the state to dismiss that challenge, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Gove, and others, alleging the bill violated procedural rules of the constitution.
Plaintiffs in the new case include a taxpayer from St. Louis County, which will not have taxes subject to the law’s caps and one from Warren County, which will have a cap that allows no growth in tax bills. The taxing districts listed in the petition are the Ozark Fire Protection District, along with school districts Warren County R-III in Warrenton, Crawford R-I in Bourbon, Ozark R-VI, Meramec Valley R-III in Pacific, Grandview R-II in Dittmer and Doniphan R-I.
The law requires each county subject to a possible cap to hold an election asking voters if they want to enact it.
Within two weeks of passing the legislation, House Speaker Jon Patterson had established an interim committee to study property taxes amid questions about the property tax provision’s constitutionality.
In 75 counties, voters could prevent property taxes from rising more than 5% per year from a base amount, or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. In 22 other counties, voters could freeze their homes’ property taxes with exceptions for newly voted levies and additional value from improvements.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many legislators from the state’s largest counties asked to be excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“No rational basis was used to categorize counties between those where the credit could result in a freeze on property tax revenue growth, a 5% cap on property tax revenue growth, or neither,” plaintiffs wrote in their initial filing.

Some of the school districts joining the lawsuit cover multiple counties that, if approved by voters, would have different levels of tax relief.
Their attorneys argue that this would violate Article X of the Missouri Constitution, which requires uniformity in taxation and limits state lawmakers’ power to divide real property into subclasses, among other things.
“As applied, (the law) may result in disparate treatment of otherwise similarly situated taxpayers because certain taxpayers for a single district may reside in political subdivisions that cover multiple counties — counties that may be subject to different property tax credit schemes.”
The lawsuit also challenges the statute under the state’s equal protection clause because the law only gives some taxpayers the right to vote on tax relief. 
The law “mandates varying levels of tax relief — either a cap of a five percent increase or no increase — denying all other similarly situated taxpayers the same level of tax relief thereby violating their equal rights and opportunity under the law,” plaintiffs wrote.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys further label the law unconstitutional for violating a section of the state’s constitution that restricts certain local or special laws.
“A law may not include less than all who are similarly situated,” plaintiffs wrote, saying the counties are grouped without a “conceivable state of facts that connect” them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

Mike Parson to fund voter-approved Medicaid expansion (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).In the special session that ended Sept. 12, lawmakers approved measures that would block the ballot process that delivered medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, reproductive care, and paid sick leave
Over the past two decades, Missouri’s broadest health reforms have come from the ballot box, not the Capitol. When the General Assembly did not act, voters legalized medical marijuana, expanded Medicaid, protected reproductive rights, and approved paid sick leave for workers who previously lacked it.
Each reform faced legislative resistance and saw its impact delayed or narrowed through lawsuits, refusals, and repeals. 
In 2018, after years of inaction in Jefferson City, voters approved medical marijuana. Opponents immediately filed lawsuits, and the state slowed implementation by tightly restricting licenses. By 2020, only a small number of dispensaries were operational statewide, showing how legal delays restricted access even after voter approval. Only after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the measure did the program move forward, illustrating the limits of voter-led policy without strong legislative follow-through.
Missouri voters approved Medicaid expansion for low-income adults in 2020, ending more than a decade of legislative resistance. Implementation did not begin until 2021, after the Missouri Supreme Court ordered the state to comply. Governor Parson and budget chair Cody Smith contended expansion would cost hundreds of millions annually and force cuts elsewhere. 
They were wrong. Uncompensated hospital costs fell, patients paid less out-of-pocket, and federal matching funds eased pressure on the state budget. By 2022, emergency department visits covered by Medicaid rose about 15%, while visits by uninsured patients fell roughly 14%. The uninsured rate has dropped sharply over the past decade, with Medicaid expansion playing a major role once it took effect in 2021. Yet rural Missouri still lags behind, with higher uninsured rates and heavier reliance on Medicaid coverage than urban areas.
In 2024, a coalition led by Missourians for Healthy Families & Fair Wages gathered signatures for Proposition A. Voters approved the measure overwhelmingly, guaranteeing paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage for roughly 728,000 workers. Proposition A was upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court when business groups challenged it, but the legislature repealed the law in 2025, immediately leaving many workers vulnerable to lost wages and increased public health risks.
The same year, voters passed Amendment 3, restoring constitutional protections for abortion, contraception, and miscarriage care after Missouri’s near total ban in 2022. 
Missouri is one of the most dangerous states in the nation to give birth. Over 40% of Missouri counties are maternity care deserts, and Black women die at four times the rate of white women. In a 2018 state mortality review, 82% of pregnancy-related deaths were found to be preventable, with Medicaid patients dying at four times the rate of mothers with private insurance — all before Missouri expanded Medicaid in 2021.
These numbers reflect lethal systemic inequities across Missouri, making timely prenatal and miscarriage care difficult to access. Amendment 3 removed legal barriers, allowing care earlier and reducing some of the risks created by limited local access. 
In 2026, Missouri voters will be asked to repeal those protections while the state seeks to delay and complicate implementation.
Even with extensions to postpartum Medicaid coverage and modest increases to dental and provider reimbursement rates, many Missourians still face gaps in access. These are lawmaker-led reforms, incremental changes that improve some services but leave large portions of the population without meaningful coverage. 
Voter-led initiatives, by contrast, have reshaped the state’s health landscape—expanding Medicaid, protecting reproductive rights, legalizing medical marijuana, and guaranteeing paid sick leave—delivering broad and tangible impacts that the legislature alone has repeatedly failed to achieve.
Missouri has repeatedly shown that voter-led reforms, paired with stronger transparency, accurate fiscal notes, and safeguards such as sunset clauses or dedicated revenue, can deliver real benefit. 
The two measures passed in the special session would dismantle the process Missourians have relied on for two decades to pass reforms their representatives repeatedly blocked.
HJR 3 would require citizen-led initiatives to win not only a statewide majority but also in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, giving a single district the power to veto a measure for the entire state. This rule applies only to voter initiatives, not to measures lawmakers place on the ballot. HB 1 adds a new tactic by authorizing mid-decade redistricting, a rare move critics warn would allow politicians to redraw maps after seeing which areas supported or opposed a measure.
Together, these changes would have nullified past voter-approved reforms at the ballot box and made it far easier for lawmakers to overturn future initiatives, leaving Missourians without the protections and expanded access that citizen-led reforms have historically delivered.
In 2025, The Fairness Project tracked roughly 150 bills across 15 state legislatures that aimed to weaken ballot initiatives, nearly double the volume from two years earlier. In Missouri, the legislative majority has already added hurdles by stretching lawsuit timelines, titling ballot summaries, tightening donor rules, and even delaying an abortion measure under the former Attorney General’s office.
For Missourians, closing the ballot means shutting down the only proven path to major health reform in the past 20 years. Supporters of redistricting initiatives argue the process can be influenced by outside interests or lead to costly programs, but the record in Missouri shows otherwise: citizen-led reforms have consistently improved health in communities and strengthened the state. 
The real risk is not in letting voters decide, but in silencing them.

The excess application of fertilizer poses serious risks to public health, raises costs for people who get their water from public utilities or private wells and increases costs for farmers, the report found. 
Throughout the report, the environmental groups included input from residents who have had their health and wallets affected by nitrate pollution. 
“I own a daycare center, and the mental toll of just staying in business because I did not cause the contamination of my well and yet am expected to solve the problem is exhausting…” Kewaunee County resident Lisa Cochart says in the report. “This could put me out of business. I work hard to provide my community with a service that assures that each child is receiving the best care and it can be shut down because of a nitrate test that I cannot control.”
The report makes a number of recommendations to better track the amount of nitrogen spread on Wisconsin’s fields and in Wisconsin’s water systems while better enforcing regulations meant to protect drinking water. But agricultural industry representatives have said the report places too much burden on farmers — even though agriculture produces up to 90% of the nitrogen in the state’s groundwater. 
“Wisconsin cannot afford to delay. The cost of inaction — both financial and human — is rising,” the report states. “A coordinated, science-based policy response is essential to reduce nitrate pollution at its source, protect public health and ecosystems, and ensure clean, safe drinking water for future generations.”
The report recommends tougher state standards for nitrates, improved enforcement of nutrient management plans on individual farms, creating a statewide registration system for manure haulers and requiring regular groundwater monitoring for factory farms. It also proposes collecting data on the cost of nitrogen contamination to public water systems, expanding the state’s existing private well compensation program and increasing the state’s nitrogen fertilizer tonnage fees.
While the report’s recommendations are aimed at a wide range of policy areas and farming is the major source of nitrogen contamination, dairy industry representatives have pushed back on its findings. Tim Trotter, CEO of the Dairy Business Association, told Wisconsin Public Radio farmers are already doing enough voluntarily to address the problem. 
“Our work with solutions-minded environmental groups and other stakeholders through a statewide clean water initiative has resulted in tailored changes to programs and policies that open up more opportunities for on-farm innovation that addresses this important issue,” Trotter said. “Reports like this one do little to bring practical, achievable solutions to water quality challenges, and can be counterproductive to progress.”
In the past, the Dairy Business Association has sued state regulators to weaken the state’s ability to regulate pollution sources such as runoff. 
The report states that the state Legislature and the courts have limited the authorities of state agencies, including the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, preventing them from doing all that is necessary to manage the contamination. 
“Because Wisconsin administrative agencies have been severely limited in their ability to establish new regulations, they have relied heavily on voluntary incentives, such as cost-sharing and price supports to incentivize farmers to implement conservation measures,” the report states. “However, it is clear that these voluntary incentives alone aren’t enough to solve Wisconsin’s nitrate problems.”
The report also found that in applying more nitrogen fertilizer than necessary, Wisconsin’s farmers are spending $8-$11 million more each year than they need to — “dollars that could be saved with more precise application.” 
More than one-third of the state’s residents get their drinking water from private wells, which are especially susceptible to nitrate contamination. The report recommends expanding the well compensation program, but adds that is just a band-aid solution. 
The program also limits participation to residents making less than $60,000 per year and includes a number of requirements that further restrict who is eligible, even if their wells exceed the state’s nitrate standard of 10 milligrams per liter, according to the report.  
Instead, the report argues, the state needs to better work to keep nitrates out of the groundwater in the first place. 
“Well compensation programs, while vital for near-term relief, are ultimately a stopgap,” the report states. “They do not address the root cause of nitrate pollution. Without stronger upstream controls on nitrate pollution, more families will face the high cost and growing scarcity of access to safe drinking water.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) is pursuing upgrades to technology used to track phones during investigations. Known as cell site simulators, the formerly murky equipment tracks phones by mimicking cell towers. Once connected to a targeted phone, cell site simulators are able to track the signal, allowing police to locate people. According to city purchasing division records, MPD aims to upgrade and acquire new components and extend a contract for the phone tracking gear by three years. 
The city’s contract with Tactical Support Equipment will be extended until 2028 and increase by $165,000 to $1.45 million. “MPD operating funds will be used,” according to records obtained by the Examiner explaining the purpose for amending the contract. The amendments will cover funds and coverage for two cell site simulators purchased in 2022, the records state. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
A separate section of the purchasing division records explains “this equipment is used on a regular basis to locate suspects and in exigent situations such as critical missing incidents.” It also states, “MPD used this equipment to help support other law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin, law enforcement in other states such as Texas, Ohio, and Michigan, and federal agencies such as FBI and DEA. At this time, MPD is seeking to upgrade the existing equipment, add additional equipment, and add warranty, support and maintenance for the new and upgraded equipment beyond what the department currently has in place. Tactical Support Equipment, Inc. is the only vendor that can support the equipment as the equipment and software is proprietary.”
MPD has used cell site simulators since at least 2010, according to logs the department uses to catalog its use of the gear. For years, the technology was used by MPD’s Fusion Center, an intelligence unit originally created for Homeland Security operations. A group of officers known as the Confidential Source Team – or CS Team – operates the cell site simulators. Logs of the technology’s use show that it’s mostly used to investigate crimes including homicides and shootings and for investigations related to overdoses or firearms. The logs also show the technology is used to locate material witnesses, kidnapping victims, but also for vague reasons like “drugs”, “long term”, or are redacted entirely.
By 2022, when Wisconsin Examiner first interviewed a member of the CS Team, both the team and its gear had been moved from the Fusion Center to MPD’s Special Investigations Division (SID), which focuses on fugitives, felonies and violent crimes. The team’s name invokes the technology’s secretive history. 
The Milwaukee department once signed non-disclosure agreements in order to acquire the technology leading to controversies in 2016, when MPD was accused of hiding use of Stingray-type devices from judges during court proceedings. When asked during a trial about how a person was located, officers used “oddly vague language,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin said, even stating that they “obtained information from an unknown source.” Things have changed over time, however. Today, the Milwaukee Police Foundation, which funnels private donations to MPD, publicly lists cell site simulators as among the technologies it helps MPD to purchase.
Like many other law enforcement agencies nationwide, for years MPD utilized phone tracking equipment produced by the Harris Corporation, a multi-billion dollar defense contractor. Harris’ devices were so common that one of its brand names, Stingray, became a common shorthand for all cell site simulators, which are also sometimes called “IMSI catchers.”

In 2019, MPD purchased a new model from Tactical Support Equipment, a North Carolina-based veteran-owned company which sells everything from K9 camera systems to cables and night-vision cameras. The company does not appear to advertise its cell phone tracking systems on its website. 
Tactical Support Equipment, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, sold MPD a single cell site simulator in 2019 for $498,900, according to purchasing division records from the time. Later that same year, MPD purchased a C-Hostile Emitter Angle Tracker (C-HEATR), which is a remote handheld mapping device that works together with the cell site simulator. 
Three years later in 2022, MPD upgraded the cell tracking gear by adding a four-channel “5G enabler solution” for $328,700, and a 12-channel portable base station with full 5G coverage (as well as insurance, training, and supporting equipment) for $951,750. 
Responding to questions from Wisconsin Examiner, MPD said that the most recent upgrades will be to “support devices operating in 5G.” The department added that “MPD is the only agency in the area that has a [cell site simulator]. When an agency needs assistance with an investigation and their request falls in line with our operating best practices, we try to provide that agency with assistance.” 
Although cell site simulators are less of an enigma than they used to be, many questions still remain. While MPD states that its technology can only track location, cell site simulators as a family of devices are known to be capable of intercepting calls and text messages, and even more exotic abilities like sending fake short messages to a target phone. In Milwaukee, local activists have long reported strange phone malfunctions and service disruptions which they suspect may be caused by law enforcement surveillance.

MPD has repeatedly denied responsibility for the claims, and has said in the past that the department’s cell site simulators do not cause malfunctions to target phones. When the Wisconsin Examiner reached out for this story, however, MPD said for the first time that “the equipment already will disrupt service to the target phone when the target phone is located. That disruption is limited to the time it takes for the operator to narrow down the location of the device.” 
The department has also repeatedly stated that its cell site simulators cannot intercept calls or text messages. A different technology known as PenLink is used by MPD for Title III investigations, which involve intercepting content of communications. In responses to Wisconsin Examiner, MPD cited Department of Justice policies and U.S. law which state that “cell site simulator technology must be configured as pen registers, and may not be used to collect contents of any communication.” Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice for more information and has not received a response. 
From 2021 to 2023, Republicans introduced bills that would have changed  how pen registers are defined in Wisconsin. Supporters of the bills, which did not pass, said that they would allow law enforcement to pursue pen registers for social media. Telecommunications experts, however, warned that the bills could open a “back door” for police to use cell site simulator devices in ways not well understood by judges or the public. 
There have been more calls for more oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee recently, with local activists pushing for  Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinances. Over two dozen U.S. cities have already passed such ordinances, which provide more transparency about the purchase and use of surveillance technologies by police departments. MPD stresses that it uses cell site simulators in accordance with DOJ policy “and only after a court order is granted in cases that are not exigent,” the department said in a statement. “There is a process in place in which utilization of the equipment is only done with supervisory approval and oversight.”

(Alexandra Beier/Getty Images)Indiana’s clean energy sector recorded only modest job growth in 2024, but the clean vehicles sector showed particularly strong performance, according to a new report.
The latest Clean Jobs America report — published by San Francisco-based business group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2 — indicated that clean energy occupations across the United States grew by 2.8% in 2024, adding nearly 100,000 jobs and outpacing broader employment growth of 0.8%.
In Indiana, however, the pace was slower.
The report found that Indiana saw just 0.4% growth in clean energy jobs in 2024, bringing the total to approximately 90,015 Hoosier jobs. That compares to Indiana’s 2023 base of around 89,600 to 90,000 jobs. In 2022, Indiana had about 88,400 clean energy jobs, and 85,298 in 2021.
Story continues below.
E2-2025-Clean-Jobs-America-2025_final
 
Within the clean energy job categories in Indiana, 53,445 jobs jobs were in the energy efficiency subsector; 20,331 jobs were related to clean vehicles; 12,017 jobs were in renewable generation; 3,404 jobs were in storage and grid modernization; and 818 jobs were in biofuels.
Energy efficiency — Indiana’s largest subsector — grew by just 0.1% in 2024, essentially flat compared to the prior year. Renewable generation jobs in the state increased 1.5% year over year, while storage and grid modernization rose 3.2%. Clean vehicles, meanwhile, grew by about 4.2% in Indiana, continuing as the fastest-growing subsector. Biofuels saw no measurable increase.
Regionally, the Midwest added around 13,293 clean energy jobs in 2024, equal to about 1.7% growth.
Though the overall growth was modest, clean-vehicle employment remains one of the stronger performing subsectors in Indiana.
Nationwide, clean-vehicle jobs more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, though 2024 saw a slight year-over-year dip.
Clean vehicle jobs across the U.S. declined by 3% last year — about 12,000 positions — even as Indiana managed a small gain. Energy efficiency nationwide grew by 2.6%, renewable generation grew 5.1%, and storage and grid modernization jumped 7.5%. Biofuels fell 0.4%.
Indiana’s clean vehicle jobs grew from 19,513 in 2023 to 20,331 in 2024 — an increase of 818 positions. That growth put the Hoosier State in the top tier of Midwest states for clean vehicle employment, trailing only Michigan and Ohio.
Indiana’s clean vehicle workforce is also heavily tied to manufacturing, according to the report. More than 70% of the state’s clean vehicle jobs are in making or assembling parts and components, compared to about 56% nationally.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Three weeks after cuts to Oklahoma providers were first reported, the Mental Health Department doesn’t have concrete numbers on how much needs to be cut to right size the agency’s budget.
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, said the agency has not publicly identified a dollar amount for how many cuts are necessary, but knows there was previous overspending that the current administration is working to correct by making strategic cuts.
Nearly 800 contracts for mental health and substance abuse providers have been reviewed, but the agency’s final decisions on cuts are still being finalized, Chaverri said. Until the agency has completed its review process, a solid number of cuts or the total dollar amount saved won’t be provided, she said. 
But Chaverri said as of Thursday, 300 line items, or pieces of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. This is being done in an effort to right-size its state appropriated budget of $400 million budget under the direction of Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic.

In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency supplemental appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
“We know because of those reports, we have to reduce,” Chaverri said. “We’ve been overspending for like 10 years. … It’s a difficult problem to solve. But that’s been the systemic approach. It’s not, ‘Let’s make cuts at random.’ It’s, ‘I’m going to go line by line.’”
No essential services will be cut from any of Oklahoma’s 77 counties, she said. “Essential services” include items like competency restoration, 24/7 crisis care like the 988 mental health hotline, inpatient psychiatric treatment, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, direct services through state facilities, among others.
The agency has also cut more than 20 executive positions, leading to $3.5 million in annual savings, she said. 
If extra “non-essential” services need to be funded, the Mental Health Department will need additional funding from the Legislature, Chaverri said. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who led a legislative investigative committee into the agency’s finances, said lawmakers knew at the conclusion of session the supplemental appropriation wouldn’t fix the agency’s budgetary issues and it was expected that changes would be made at the Mental Health Department.

Lawson said it’s “appropriate” to not have a number at this point, and he’d rather that the agency be thorough and not put out erroneous numbers, which would sow instability and erode legislative and public trust. 
“In a field where every day is kind of uncertain for folks in crisis, we just want to have a stable and robust network of services to be there for people when they need it,” he said. “And the last thing I think we need across the board is uncertainty or ‘Well, they said it was this number last month, and now they’re saying it’s this number,’ so now there’s no trust.”
Lawson said the Mental Health Department has brought in financial experts to help rectify its budget issues, including the business management company Deloitte. 
Lawmakers from the House and Senate were briefed about potential contract cuts about a month ago and the Mental Health Department had initially identified around $50 million in contracts related to substance use disorder that could be duplicative, Lawson said. This doesn’t necessarily mean all $50 million will be cut. 
While he said there will be some disruption, if the cuts later result in a “glaring gap” in services, his committee will be prepared to deal with revisiting contracts.
He said he’s confident the Legislature will be able to work with the agency to reach an accurate budget for the next fiscal year, but there could be more “bumps in the road.” 
Providers have reached out to him and other lawmakers, Lawson said. He’s heard mixed answers about how they can handle the cuts. Larger providers have told Lawson they can pivot and adapt to the changes, while smaller providers are more concerned. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“You’re not going to find a single provider that says, ‘Hey, you know what? We really don’t provide any value to the state, or we don’t provide good service,’” Lawson said. “They’re not going to say that. They all think that they’re doing great work. And they’re concerned about the folks that they take care of. But then also their business, too, is if some of these proposed cuts are deep enough, it may cause them to have to make some very serious business decisions, including closing their doors.”
Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, was also briefed on the cuts and said she was surprised by them. Kirt said she asked the agency what the goal of the cuts was. She said she wasn’t provided a dollar amount but was told the agency is aiming to “live within its means.” 
“Yes, look for efficiency,” she said. “Yes, make sure you’re not wasting money. No question, we want them doing that, but automatically cutting a bunch with no clear number in mind concerns me.”
Kirt said she respects the interim commissioner and said he’s a “very honest player trying to do the right thing,” but she’s worried about overly focusing on the budget’s dollar amount rather than the sought-after improved outcomes. 
“The Legislature should not be micromanaging every contract,” she said. “But we do need to understand what the priorities are.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It’s ironic that a man who built his political career railing passionately about teachers “unions” will soon be running one of his own.
But in a way it’s almost fitting that it will be the next move for Oklahoma education Superintendent Ryan Walters, who has made it his mission to babble bizarre, inflammatory rhetoric and launch random witchhunts against educators and their unions.
Maybe it will help him recenter on who is vitally important to the success of our public schools — the teachers. Because if he truly wants to be successful, the role will require him to collaborate with them and show some empathy toward their needs.
Those are two skillsets that he’s been sorely lacking the past two years and 10 months in his elected position. 
And maybe it will serve as a rude awakening that he’s betrayed the trust of Oklahomans who believed he could turn our schools around. They’ll now find themselves with a politically appointed leader they didn’t get to choose, for the remaining year or so of what should have been Walters’ term.
In case you weren’t randomly tuned into Fox News at 10:43 p.m. Wednesday, Walters was allotted just under 40 seconds on a national conservative talk program to announce he has accepted a new role as CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance. The group bills itself as an “alternative to traditional union membership,” but provides “professional support services and resources” for educators.
The group, which so far boasts a measly 2,800 members nationwide, is a new effort of the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting government overreach, defending workers’ rights and protecting constitutional freedom.”
“For decades, union bosses have poisoned our schools with politics and propaganda while abandoning parents, students, and good teachers. That ends today. We’re going to expose them, fight them, and take back our classrooms,” Walters said in a statement released by the Freedom Foundation. “At the Teacher Freedom Alliance, we’re giving educators real freedom, freedom from the liberal, woke agenda that has corrupted public education. We will arm teachers with the tools, support, and freedom they need, without forcing them to give up their values.”
The Teacher Freedom Alliance sure sounds like it has the same mission of a teachers union — you know, those groups Walters has loved to hate.
In January, Walters launched a tone deaf tirade attempting to link schools and teachers unions to the deadly truck attack in New Orleans and even used the phrase “terrorist training camps” to describe school classrooms.
This year, he also falsely claimed teachers unions love standardized testing (they don’t).
He pushed the state Board of Education to take away the teaching license of a former Norman High School educator for sharing a QR code to the Brooklyn Public Library’s free online catalog. He is trying to revoke two other educators’ licenses over social media posts related to the 2024 assassination attempt of President Donald Trump.
And most recently, he’s threatened to ban teachers for things they’ve posted on social media about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Now he’s going to be something of a union boss himself? That was not a square on my 2025 bingo card.
While the Teacher Freedom Alliance bills itself as a “viable alternative to unions,” it does appear to share many similarities with Oklahoma’s organizing groups. In Oklahoma, a few of the largest districts do have groups that collectively bargain for educators, but most don’t. However, one thing that makes Oklahoma’s associations different from unions in other states is that they cannot strike. But much like the Teacher Freedom Alliance, Oklahoma’s organizations provide their members liability insurance if they ever get sued as well as professional development training and an “engaged community of educators.”
In light of his new job, it sure appears that Walters has been spewing a whole lot of hyperbole about educators that he actually doesn’t believe. That’s pretty sad for our children and the teachers we’ve entrusted to educate them.
It also appears that Walters never intended to actually help fix our school system. Instead, he used the post that we entrusted him with to try to gain the attention of conservative groups so he could grab a cushy job.
Oklahoma voters — and teachers — deserve better. They deserve a public official who is committed to rolling up their sleeves and working together, and not someone who flees in terror when things get hard. And they need someone who is competent and understands how schools work and who isn’t motivated by grabbing headlines.
Hopefully fellow Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt will choose carefully when it comes time to fill the role. He’ll get to pick Walters’ successor once he officially resigns.
Walters has proven he doesn’t have a lot of respect for the voters who elected and believed in him if last night was any indication.
He couldn’t be bothered to let Oklahomans know he was leaving in a publicly accessible forum. Instead, he chose a late-night, cable talk show slot, which many Oklahomans don’t have access to, to announce he’s washing his hands of us.
Walters was likely a frontrunner in the 2026 gubernatorial race. I say that judging from the multitude of emails in support of him that I’ve received from people all over the state the past two years.
If he still harbored any plans to run for governor, I think he’s shot himself in the foot.
Oklahomans don’t like quitters. And they certainly don’t like hypocrites who preach one thing publicly while secretly believing something else.

The 441-million-ton coal lease that lingered for years for lack of industry interest is now on the selling block.
The post Feds set auction date for first major Wyoming coal lease in a decade appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued a “record of decision” Thursday, greenlighting the sale of 441 million tons of coal in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming — the first major federal coal lease offering in the region in a decade.
The West Antelope III coal lease will go to competitive auction on Oct. 8, the agency said. 
Though the 3,508-acre tract contains approximately 441 million tons of coal, the estimated “recoverable” volume is about 365 million tons, according to the BLM. “The recoverable coal volume and duration of leased reserves is driven by economics and subject to change,” the agency said.
The tract is associated with Navajo Transitional Energy Company’s Antelope mine and spans areas of Campbell and Converse counties. Navajo Transitional’s predecessor, Cloud Peak Energy, nominated the tract in 2015, kicking off the BLM’s review process. But federal action on the request went idle when Cloud Peak filed for bankruptcy in 2019. The company eventually sold its Powder River Basin mines to Navajo Transitional. The BLM revived the lease sale approval process just days after the One Big Beautiful Bill was signed in July.

“This coal leasing effort directly supports the Trump administration’s goals of reinvigorating the American coal industry, reducing reliance on foreign energy, and creating good-paying jobs in rural communities,” the agency said in a press release. “It also aligns with Secretary [Doug] Burgum’s vision of unleashing domestic energy production while streamlining federal processes and ensuring long-term economic growth.”
The West Antelope III coal lease, along with 14.5 million tons of extra coal reserves included in a pending modification plan for the Antelope mine, would add about 18 years to the life of the mine, according to BLM estimates. The Antelope mine extracts 20-25 million tons annually and employs about 400 workers, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
The size of the coal lease, as well as the Trump administration’s expedited timeline to put it up for auction, is cause for concern, according to the Sheridan-based Powder River Basin Resource Council, which formed in the 1970s, in part, to watchdog the industry.
“Where’s the market for this lease, and does the lease make sense in the current market?” Resource Council Executive Director Donna Birkholz wants to know.
Though the Powder River Basin coal industry has benefited from a slowdown in coal-burning electric power plant retirements, it’s a long way from recovering from a steep market slide that began 15 years ago, cutting the mining district’s annual production by nearly half.
Lingering uncertainty about the industry’s future underscores concerns about potential environmental impacts if coal companies are unable to make good on reclamation requirements, Birkholz added.
The Resource Council, along with other conservation groups, has also noted that recent cuts to coal royalty rates — by both Wyoming and the federal government — will result in lower revenues to state and federal coffers compared to past coal leases.Visit this BLM website to learn more about the West Antelope III coal lease.

(Photo by Idaho Capital Sun)Getting a COVID vaccine is different this year. 
Under the Trump administration, federal government agencies limited eligibility and, just last week, softened recommendations for who should receive them.
But most people who want to be vaccinated for COVID should still be able to, and their health insurance would probably cover it, said Idaho’s state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn.
“No one is prohibited from getting the vaccination based on those recommendations,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Here’s a guide on how to get vaccines for COVID and the flu in the Gem State.
 Am I eligible for the COVID vaccine?

In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 vaccines but limited them to people aged 65 and older and younger people (age six months to age 64) who are at risk for severe illness. 
There’s a long list of things that put people at high risk for severe COVID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says that can include mental health conditions, being overweight, not being physically active, being a current or former smoker, cancer, heart conditions, having a weakened immune system and more. 
Most adults can likely identify they have something on the CDC’s list, Hahn said. And even if you aren’t sure the vaccine isn’t licensed for you, she said doctors can still prescribe it.
“If you say, ‘I might not have this condition, but my spouse does. I take care of my spouse who has cancer, and I really want to be protected.’ That is certainly something that can still be done,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun. “It is considered off-label, but this is … the same type of vaccine that you may have received in years past and should be safe for you.”
 Is COVID still spreading?

In Idaho, COVID spread is up, according to the limited public health data still available after officials scaled back reporting after the pandemic ended. 
There’s less COVID-19 data now. But here’s how to track the virus in Idaho.

Idaho’s hospitalizations are rising, and 30 nursing homes in the state recently had patients sick with COVID, Hahn said. 
“When we start hearing that, we know COVID is out there,” she said. 
Idaho’s wastewater levels for COVID are “very high,” according to the CDC’s tracker. 
ER visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Idaho to around 50 to 80 a day in the first couple weeks of this month, compared to around 40 a day in July, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s tracker. 
Flu is seasonal. But COVID isn’t, said Dr. Sky Blue, an infectious disease doctor in Boise. 
“It’s not a wait till October kind of thing if you want your protection,” he told the Sun. “And we know that there’s circulating cases right now.”
Research shows COVID vaccines reduce the risk of death, serious disease, visits to the emergency department and even long-COVID, a chronic condition that persists even after infection ends. 
Hahn said she still gets vaccinated to reduce the risk of getting long-COVID.
 Is the COVID shot recommended for me? 

Last week, the CDC’s top vaccine panel softened recommendations for who should get COVID vaccines.
The recommendations could emphasize the risk of COVID vaccines and stress individual decisionmaking, even though the CDC’s data shows that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people, the Georgia Recorder reported. But the panel didn’t pull back the CDC’s recommendations that younger people, between six months old and 64 years old, get vaccinated.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

To become official, the panel’s recommendations require approval by CDC leaders. 
In a statement, officials for the CDC’s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the panel’s recommendations include “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk, according to the CDC list of COVID-19 risk factors.”
“It’s a nuanced recommendation,” Hahn said. “But essentially, for Idahoans, what’s important to know is that if you would like to get the COVID vaccine, it should be available and recommended for you.”
Asked how people should decide if they should get the COVID vaccine, she suggested people assess their own risk — and the risk of people they are around.
As the federal government’s health agencies, led by U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., restricted vaccine access this year, more than a dozen states protected vaccine access, Stateline reported. 
Idaho wasn’t one of them.
“We felt that what (the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel) came up with last week actually can align with what we would like to do, which is that people 6 months and older who are interested in getting the vaccine, we believe should have access to the vaccine,” Hahn told the Sun. “We’re seeing that pharmacies are carrying it. We know our pharmacists can prescribe it, but if people want to go talk to their doctor about it, that they have that choice as well.”
 Will insurance still cover the COVID vaccines?

Many insurance companies say they’ll keep covering COVID vaccines. 
Before the CDC vaccine advisory panel’s vote, a group representing most major insurers in the U.S. pledged to continue covering COVID vaccines.
“Health plans will continue to cover all … immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026,” America’s Health Insurance Plans said in a statement. 
In Idaho, at least two major insurers have made similar commitments.
“We continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines for our members, as we have in the past, and are monitoring the regulatory environment,” Blue Cross of Idaho spokesperson Bret Rumbeck told the Sun in a statement. “We encourage members to talk with their healthcare provider about the vaccine.”
Regence BlueShield of Idaho’s parent company issued a similar statement last week, saying “Coverage for COVID-19 vaccinations remains unchanged through the end of 2025.”
But if you wonder whether your insurer will cover a COVID vaccine, Hahn recommends checking with them or your doctor or pharmacist. 
 How will pharmacies give out the COVID vaccine?

How pharmacies interpret the new COVID vaccine eligibility could vary, Blue said. He recommends calling ahead if you want to know what the pharmacy would require from you to get the vaccine. 
 What about the flu vaccine?

Hahn recommends everyone consider getting the flu shot. Earlier this month, a CDC report found that the last flu season was “high-severity.”
“Even if you’re not too worried about getting a severe case, it could keep you from missing work, missing school, missing out on your day-to-day life,” she said. 
Doctors say it’s safe to get the flu vaccine at the same time as the COVID vaccine.
But if you like to get your vaccines separately, Hahn recommended getting the COVID vaccine first because the virus is already circulating. 
Some doctors recommend waiting until late September or early October to get the flu shot. That’s because immunity from flu shots can wear off, but the flu season usually reaches its peak around February each year, and can stretch into the spring.
But Blue said if people are already gearing up to get their COVID vaccines, they can get their flu shot at the same time. 
“I think the chances of missing it are a bigger risk,” he said of the flu shot.

(Photo via Palmyra Fire Rescue Facebook page)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Under a proposed partnership with federal Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), the Palmyra Police Department would focus on criminals — not on people simply because they might be immigrants without legal status, the department’s interim police chief told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview last week. 
Interim Police Chief Paul Blount also said that partnering with ICE would allow department officers to get access to databases and resources to better fight serious crimes, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking.
Along with the proposed partnership deal, the Palmyra department has the potential to receive payments for its involvement. According to CBS 58 News, Blount said last week that the agreement might “be the difference in this next year of having officers on the street during the daytime and nighttime.”
Blount spoke with the Wisconsin Examiner for about 40 minutes Thursday about the village’s proposed ICE partnership. The arrangement, under the ICE task force model, would grant officers limited authority to enforce immigration law while performing routine police duties. The department would also receive reimbursements from ICE. 
Task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012, but the government has revived the program in President Donald Trump’s second term, Stateline reported.
The 287(g) program allows participating local law enforcement to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law in partnerships with ICE. While 13 Wisconsin counties have a sheriff’s department partnering with ICE, Palmyra would be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin between a police department and ICE. 
The Palmyra partnership would also be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin using the task force model. Other models focus on people who are already in custody. 
The proposal still awaits approval by the Palmyra village board. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin issued a press release last week criticizing the potential partnership, saying the department is “partnering hand in glove with ICE to carry out this regime’s plan to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones.” 
Chief: Little change for police operations
In his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount said that under the arrangement with ICE, the village police department would not be operating much differently than it does now. 
In addition to cooperating with the federal government, Blount said,  “Obviously the financial incentive that was newly added that goes along with it was another reason why we looked at this program, and said, ‘We’re already doing a majority of what this involves. So why would we not collaborate with them, and then we could have the financial incentive that goes along with it.’” 
The ICE website says officers may also exercise limited immigration authority as active participants on ICE-led task forces. 
In its statement, the ACLU said that the task force model “gives officers the green light to stop people they think might be immigrants on the street, question them about their citizenship status, and even take them into custody.”
Blount said the department will not go door to door to check individuals’ documentation or profile people who they think may lack documentation. Palmyra police will collaborate with ICE when someone is involved in criminal activity, wanted on a warrant or facing criminal charges, he said. 
Blount, who is also the director of public safety for the village, said he is one of three full-time officers in the department, along with five part-time officers. 
Asked whether a Palmyra Police Department officer might ask people about their immigration status if they are pulled over for traffic violations — rather than something that would lead police to take a driver to jail — Blount said he didn’t think that was likely. 
 “For a simple traffic stop, that is something that we would be allowed to do,” Blount said, “and I would say that I haven’t made a final decision on that yet. If it involves criminal traffic, the answer to that would be yes, if it’s criminal traffic. So there are certain things that rise to the element of criminal traffic law…but basic traffic [offenses] like a speeding ticket, probably not.”
Blount said that distinction would potentially be detailed in a policy if the village moves ahead with the partnership.  
In its statement, the ACLU of Wisconsin raised concerns about racial profiling. A 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination in an Arizona task force. 
The ACLU also called for “a balanced approach to immigration that includes both humane border management and a pathway to citizenship.”
If Palmyra moves forward with the partnership, Blount said he is leaning “towards establishing policies and procedures to prevent any type of profiling that the agreement has the potential for.” 
ICE now lists Palmyra Police Department as a participating 287(g) agency with the task force model, with a signature date of Monday, Sept. 22. Blount said the department received federal approval on Wednesday. 
The department’s application for the task force model is pending review by the village board, Blount said, and the board’s vote will be posted on a meeting agenda before it takes place. 
Officers who will be involved must take 40 hours of training and education, which has not started yet, Blount said.  
A financial boon
Blount said the program would come with significant financial incentives from the federal government. 
At the time of his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount was unsure of the exact amounts that Palmyra would receive. He later sent the Examiner a press release from the Department of Homeland Security dated Sept. 17, which includes details about reimbursement opportunities that will begin Oct. 1. 
A 287(g) fact sheet on ICE’s website contains a section titled “Task Force Model Reimbursement Plan Benefits,” which include $7,500 for equipment for each trained task force officer, $100,000 for new vehicles, salary and benefits reimbursed per trained task force officer and overtime funds up to 25% of salary.
Agencies will also be able to receive quarterly performance awards, up to $1,000 per eligible task force officer, based on “the successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland,” the ICE press release states.
Members of the village board did not respond to interview requests from the Wisconsin Examiner.
In his interview, Blount said he believes he and the board are listening to community questions.
“We’ve had a fair amount of support and a fair amount of, lack of a better term, negativity and pushback for the potential pending agreement,” Blount said. “So we’re listening to both sides and listening to that feedback, and I think obviously the board then will make their decision based on that.”
Blount said he didn’t think the village board would weigh in on the specifics of how he participates in the agreement. 
“They usually don’t get involved in my operations per se,” he said.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — Conservative and liberal students at Nebraska colleges say they want to turn down the temperature on the heated political dialogue dominating national conversations in the weeks since the killing of Charlie Kirk.
But they’ve got their work cut out.
The call for a return to civil discourse among young Nebraskans comes against the backdrop of President Donald Trump pledging to use the federal government to investigate political foes on the “radical left.” 
Ethnie Barnhouse, the president of University of Nebraska-Lincoln chapter of Kirk’s political organization Turning Point USA, which was designed to engage college students, said she hopes more young conservatives will “be bold and be courageous” and speak openly with others about their views. 
“They’re going to think you’re some evil person … I want people not to be afraid to have those conversations,” Barnhouse said at a UNL campus vigil honoring Kirk days after he was killed. “Because a lot of the time, when people think that about you, it’s just because they haven’t talked to you, and they don’t actually know what you believe.” 
After the vigil — whose speakers included Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican – Barnhouse took questions from fellow students and community members who wanted to get more involved with Turning Point. Barnhouse said she was surprised by the turnout and level of interest.

Campus conservatives at some of the state’s largest schools in Lincoln and Omaha credited Kirk for encouraging them to be more open about their political views in what many described as environments hostile  to conservatism. Several said they plan to make sharper efforts to organize young people while also calling for more civil dialogue with people across the political spectrum. 
Young liberals also hope for more civil disagreement, rather than the rhetoric often seen on social media and among politicians. Troy Kallhoff, president of the UNL chapter of the Young Democrats, said he was deeply disturbed that people would try to “resolve political divide and political grievance” with violence. 
“Regardless of how much I disagree with him or any other political activist or politician, I would never wish for them to be murdered or killed,” Kallhoff said.  
Kirk was shot during a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, in early September. The 22-year-old man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, had sent text messages to his romantic partner that he had “had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred” and that “some hate can’t be negotiated out,” according to Utah prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty.
The Kirk shooting was the latest instance of political violence in the U.S. An arsonist burned the Pennsylvania Governor’s Mansion in April. Two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, D.C. in May. A Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were shot and killed in June. A Georgia man was indicted in June for allegedly making threats across state lines against Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer.

Dona-Gene Barton, a UNL political science professor who studies political behavior, said political violence isn’t new in American history. But she said this political moment is different because of high levels of “affective polarization.” 
“It’s a context where the rhetoric and the effect of polarization among political elites [and] average citizens is [already] at a dangerous [level] to begin with,” Barton said. 
Kirk and Turning Point, which he founded in 2012, were credited with mobilizing younger voters to support Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Trump made gains with young people, a demographic Democrats previously dominated, which helped him win the popular vote. 
But Kirk also appealed to some in the Republican base with his statements directed at minorities. He criticized LGBTQ rights, suggested more women should stay home and not work and criticized the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with some of Martin Luther King Jr.’s work. 
Among Turning Point’s best-known projects was the “Professor Watchlist,” which published the names of college professors in a searchable format by categories including “anti-Christian views,” “feminism,” “climate alarmist” and “racial ideology.” 
Despite the controversies, many young conservatives, including UNL student Zoey Salem, credited Kirk for engaging students and encouraging them to speak freely.

“Even as a conservative, I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that wasn’t really the point of Charlie Kirk to me,” said Salem. “The point was that he was giving a platform to all people.”
Kallhoff, of the UNL Young Democrats, said he hopes that after Kirk’s assassination people can “come together and have civilized conversations” and understand that “we’re all trying to make the country better.” 
Creighton University students Emma Smith and Hannah Sobczyk said people need to stop hiding behind social media and start having face-to-face conversations again. At the end of the day, Sobczyk said, people need to respect that people have different political beliefs.
“We’re all people,” Smith said. 
Barton, the political scientist, said she hopes politicians will tone down the rhetoric used in response to Kirk’s death, because it “doesn’t do any good for trying to calm the tensions.”
“In the past, political elites, when you had incidents of political violence in this country, they would try to be more unifying,” Barton said. “Some … have responded by trying to weaponize this event.”
At UNL, Barnhouse said she is focused on honoring Kirk’s legacy.
“My life would look very different if it weren’t for Charlie Kirk,” Barnhouse said. 
Kallhoff said the next generation is tired of the political divide and government stagnation
“The only option is for it to get better,” Kallhoff said.

Open enrollment for Medicare — when people can change their insurance coverage — starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. But insurers have been changing, and even pulling out of, Medicare Advantage, which are private plans for the federal health insurance program for older Americans and people with disabilities.
“Consumers should use this annual Open Enrollment Period to compare plans, confirm that their doctors and prescriptions are covered, and seek free, objective help …” Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron said in a statement. “Taking action early ensures uninterrupted coverage and continued access to quality care. Most importantly, consumers should know they are not alone — our team is ready to help every step of the way.”
He recommended several options to get help: directly from the Idaho Department of Insurance; through the agency’s program for Senior Health Insurance Benefit Advisors, also known as SHIBA; or from a local insurance agent. 
More than half of people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, which tend to cover extra benefits than traditional Medicare. 
 How are Medicare Advantage plans changing?

Because of rising costs, less federal payments and new regulations, some insurers who offer Medicare Advantage Plans are reducing benefits, trimming provider networks and leaving some areas, the Department of Insurance announced in a news release last week. Last year, after many insurers pulled Medicare Advantage plans, more than a million patients needed to find new health insurance, Stateline reported. 
Idaho Department of Insurance officials expect plans to be withdrawn in 2026. But even if plans stay in Idaho, agency officials say benefits or provider networks could change. 
By Oct. 1, all people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans should receive an explanation of any changes to their plan from the insurance carrier through a letter called an Annual Notice of Change.
Right now, seven insurance carriers offer Medicare Advantage plans in Idaho counties. 
If plans are canceled, people affected may be able to switch plans, through Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, if they qualify for a special enrollment period. 
 How can you get help on Medicare in Idaho?

In Idaho, contact the Department of Insurance’s SHIBA program for free assistance to help compare plans, answer questions, review coverage options, help with complaints and enroll in Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans.
To contact SHIBA or enroll in the program’s monthly Medicare webinar workshops, call 1-800-247-4422.

(Aaron Marco/KFF Health News)Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.
“It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead,” said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Through North Carolina’s Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family’s home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can’t get help.
Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult.
Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state’s biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump’s hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.
North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and caregivers.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Financial Management.
 What types of health services does Medicaid cover?

Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.
North Carolina’s Medicaid agency announced it will institute on Oct. 1 a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Fabrello said her son’s dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can’t get because there aren’t enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.
Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.
“When you say, ‘We’re just cutting provider rates,’ you’re actually cutting access for him for all his needs,” Fabrello said.
Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state’s Medicaid network and result in “an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.”
The imminent cuts in North Carolina “don’t have anything to do” with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.
“This is like the layers of the onion,” she said. “We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.” North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.
More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.
“We all hope it changes,” Dowler said, adding that if it does not, “you’re going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.”

Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina’s Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the covid-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.
But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.
“It’s a difficult moment for North Carolina,” said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is “absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.”
For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the “most vulnerable in our community.”
Western North Carolina Community Health Services’ three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.
 Medicaid cuts in Idaho met with backlash from health providers, operators and advocacy groups

Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.
The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75% to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to “to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.”
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.
The Idaho Hospital Association’s Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization’s chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days’ cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days’ cash or less, she said.
“Hopefully, none of them will close,” Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.
Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state’s general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.
Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.

In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until North Carolina began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She’s received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.
Now, if the state reductions go through, she faces a salary cut.
“As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it,” Fabrello said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)Residents of Memphis are expecting to see a surge in federal and state law enforcement officers in their city as early as today to carry out President Donald Trump’s order for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel.”
More than a dozen federal law enforcement agencies, an unspecified number of National Guard members and 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be part of a “sustained” presence to fight crime in one of the nation’s largest majority Black cities beginning this week, There is no specific end date to the operation, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday. 
National Guard troops will be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service to support local law enforcement and will not be armed nor make arrests, Lee said.
The federal show of force includes immigration enforcement officers; the Tennessee Highway Patrol, under an agreement entered earlier this year, also has immigration enforcement powers.

Local faith leaders, community groups, elected officials and legal rights organizations opposed to hundreds of outside personnel authorized by the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiated a series of actions last week in response. 
On Saturday, protestors gathered separately in Memphis and at the state capitol in Nashville to formally launch the “Free the 901” campaign, a coalition formed by local and state nonprofit organizations after Trump issued his executive order Sept. 15 to “restore law and order” to Memphis.
The group has set up a text alert system and said it intends to provide training to residents and coordinate rapid volunteer response to law enforcement actions while advocating for policies to address root causes of violence.
Cardell Orrin, Tennessee director of Stand for Children, said the group’s goal is to find ways to “limit the harm” of the federal presence and identify and provide support to Memphians impacted. 
On Wednesday, the ACLU Tennessee sent a letter to Memphis Mayor Paul Young and Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis detailing the city’s obligations to comply with a long-running consent decree that protects the First Amendment rights of Memphians.
The Kendrick Consent decree was enacted in 1978 in response to revelations that Memphis police had used a domestic intelligence unit to surveille and target civil rights leaders. The decree was updated in 2020 to include safeguards against police use of modern surveillance technology. 
The agreement between the ACLU and Memphis specifically bars cooperation by Memphis police with federal and state agencies in activities that violate First Amendment rights, including sharing information such as photographs, recordings and social media posts of individuals engaged in lawful protests, absent a legitimate law enforcement reason, according to Stella Yarbrough, ACLU-TN Legal Director 
“The Kendrick Consent Decree represents nearly five decades of protection for Memphis residents’ First Amendment rights,” she said.
Tennessee National Guard set for Memphis deployment next week

“Federal and National Guard involvement in local law enforcement doesn’t diminish these protections. In fact, it makes strict compliance more critical than ever. Memphis police cannot use federal coordination as a backdoor to conduct the very surveillance activities this decree was designed to prevent,” Yarbrough said. 
Memphis officials responded late last week with a request to a meeting with lawyers for the ACLU Tennessee, a spokesperson for the organization confirmed Friday. 
Some city officials in Memphis have also individually taken steps to prepare residents for a surge in law enforcement.
Shelby County General Sessions Clerk Tami Sawyer, who has expressed concerns about the potential impact of the law enforcement influx on already-overcrowded detention centers, issued a public “preventative maintenance checklist” for individuals to protect themselves. 
The list advises individuals to check for or clear outstanding warrants, memorize phone numbers of family or trusted friends and make an emergency plan for children and pets if detained.
Shelby County Commissioner Erica Sugarman, in Washington, DC last week, said she was also sharing information gleaned from advocates in the nation’s capitol after the National Guard deployment there.
Her deepest concern, Sugarman said, is “educating the people how to react and not to react,” particularly young people.

“We’ve got 12th graders who are driving around,” she said. “I want to make sure they know their headlights are working and understand their legal rights, that law enforcement isn’t the judge, jury and prosecutor.”
Appearing alongside the Tennessee governor last week, Memphis’s Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who previously said he had not asked for the federal presence, appeared more conciliatory. The mayor has noted that crime has fallen in Memphis by double digit percentage since January 2024. 
Not all Memphis leaders are opposed to the surge to fight crime in the city. Last week, a resolution to block the deployment and a resolution to set parameters, including a 90-day limit, on a federal law enforcement presence failed to pass at the Shelby County Commission.
“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Last week, the city of Memphis launched a website to provide updates and information on the federal surge and provide residents with a contact number to lodge complaints. 
“This is our moment to show the world the truth about Memphis,” read a message from Young on the site. “We are a city that rises, a city that leads, and a city that defines itself not by challenges, but by our culture, innovation, and hope.”

Adrian Smith cruised to victory last year.,"Democrat Becky Stille is banking on her moderate approach. (Courtesy of Stille campaign)LINCOLN — Democrat Becky Stille is running for Congress against a 10-term incumbent House Republican in one of the nation’s most conservative districts. 
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. The district is currently represented by U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith of Gering, who, as is typical in Nebraska’s reddest red district, faces a GOP challenger to his right. 
Stille, who lives in South Sioux City, said she decided to run after one of her farmer neighbors had to put up one of his plots of land for auction. While she doesn’t know precisely why that triggered her bid, she felt it “was enough.” 
Another reason, she said, is that she knows President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer will hurt friends and family members. Stille said she feels the district hasn’t had effective representation in D.C. for a “long time.”
The district currently has 268,246 registered Republicans compared to 70,368 registered Democrats. Including nonpartisans and third-party members, it has 418,138 eligible voters, according to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.

Stille says she considers herself a moderate Democrat. 
“I’m hoping that it’ll appeal to some of the Republicans … especially like the farmers that have had a bad taste in their mouth,” Stille said, pointing to the impact of Trump’s tariffs and trade disputes on agriculture. 
Stille’s top issues, according to her campaign website, range from supporting labor unions to securing the border and upholding the Second Amendment while having an “equally strong commitment to prevent violence” and  “support a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions privately with her own doctor.” 
She said she would listen to district constituents, which is something she argues Smith isn’t doing. 
The Smith campaign had no immediate comment on the Stille bid. Smith cruised to victory in 2024, winning by 61 percentage points against Democrat Dan Ebers. 
While traveling between work as an agricultural lab tech and campaigning, Stille says she is grateful for the help she is getting from the state party for her campaign. 
Stille acknowledges she is new to the inner workings of politics but said she hopes to help narrow the nation’s political divide. 
“Just because we have different opinions doesn’t mean we can’t work together to get things done,” Stille said.

(Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Livestock producers in nearly two-thirds of Tennessee counties who incurred extra feed costs in 2024 due to flooding brought by Hurricane Helene may be eligible for federal funding through the Emergency Livestock Relief Program.
The program, meant to help offset increased feed costs due to flood and wildfire disasters throughout the country in 2023 and 2024, is expected to pay out about $1 billion, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brook L. Rollins announced earlier this month.
Tennessee had no qualifying flood or fire events in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. But 59 Tennessee counties — including all of West Tennessee and multiple East Tennessee counties — are pre-determined as eligible for flood events in 2024.
The USDA’s Farm Service Agency identified 59 Tennessee counties that are eligible for the Emergency Livestock Relief Program assistance to offset higher feed costs caused by Hurricane Helene in September 2024. (Photo: USDA)
Eligible livestock include beef and dairy cattle, buffalo, bison, beefalo (a bison-cattle hybrid), alpacas, llamas, deer, elk, reindeer, ostriches, emus, equine, goats and sheep.
Producers can receive up to 60% of three months of feed costs for a qualifying flood, according to the USDA. The program has a cap of $125,000 per producer for each program year, though. Producers who already received the maximum payment from the Emergency Livestock Relief Program for Drought and Wildfire, a program announced in May, are not eligible for additional flood relief payments.
The funding comes from the American Relief Act of 2025, which allotted about $940 million to flood and wildfire assistance. Should national demand for relief exceed that amount, the USDA will apply a “national payment factor” based on the number of eligible applicants, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Applications for assistance opened on Sept. 15 and will close on Oct. 31. Livestock producers in eligible counties are not required to submit supporting documentation for floods or wildfires. Producers outside of the counties identified by the FSA can apply for aid, but need to include documentation of a qualifying flood or wildfire in the county where livestock were kept, according to the USDA.
Cattle and calves are Tennessee’s number one agricultural commodity in terms of cash receipts, according to the USDA Tennessee Field Office.
Hurricane Helene dumped between 3 and 10 inches of rain in some areas of the state between Sept. 26 and Sept. 30, 2024, flooding some fields and interrupting the harvest. Floodwaters knocked out bridges and major infrastructure, most acutely in Northeast Tennessee.
“For livestock producers, the economic consequences were swift and severe,” the American Farm Bureau Federation stated in a Sept. 16 news release. “Transportation costs soared as washed-out infrastructure delayed feed shipments. Replacement feed was more expensive and harder to find, with crop failures adding to shortages.”
Tennessee Department of Agriculture representatives visited upper East Tennessee in June to survey ongoing recovery efforts. Hurricane Helene’s impact on Tennessee farmers and forestland owners is estimated at up to $1.8 billion, according to the state’s agriculture department.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Families in Cass and Grand Forks counties may soon have different options for college courses for high school students. 
The State Board of Higher Education last week approved a policy change that allows high school students in those counties to take dual-credit courses — earning both high school and college credit — through the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University. 
Students in Cass and Grand Forks counties had previously been required to take dual-credit classes through one of North Dakota’s smaller public colleges, with the college getting the tuition revenue. Those students could only take a dual-credit course from UND or NDSU if it was not offered at a smaller college. 
Leaders of those smaller colleges have resisted the change in part because of the tuition revenue they get from students taking introductory college courses while they are still in high school.
Those colleges include North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton, Valley City State University, Mayville State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake. 
North Dakota State College of Science President Rod Flanigan (Provided by North Dakota University System)
Rod Flanigan, president of North Dakota State College of Science, a two-year school, said the change could cost his school millions of dollars in revenue annually. 
The college in Wahpeton in Richland County has about 1,500 dual-credit students this semester, most of them from Cass County, the neighboring county to the north. 
“It will have an impact on us,” Flanigan told the State Board of Higher Education when it met Tuesday at Minot State University. “We will compete as best we can.”
Advocates for the change said the policy should be about choice for students, not the financial health of the small colleges. 
State Board of Higher Education member Curtis Biller said during a Sept. 4 committee meeting that if there are financial implications for the small colleges, “we can deal with it as we move forward.” 
It will be up to NDSU and UND to work with high schools on which courses to make available through dual credit. 
NDSU Provost David Bertolini said the university will reach out to high schools in Cass County to understand what the schools, parents and students want for dual-credit offerings. 
“We get requests from students who want to do dual credit with us, and historically, we have to say ‘no,’” Bertolini said in an interview. “From the perspective of what families and students might want for themselves, their hopes and dreams for college or whatever their careers might be, student choice is paramount.”
Board appoints former lieutenant governor to lead North Dakota University System

Historically, the university system has encouraged campuses to operate in their own region.
Another college that could be significantly impacted is Lake Region, which has about 250 dual credit students from nearby Grand Forks County, home to UND. 
UND President Andy Armacost said it would work with Lake Region to minimize the impact on the two-year school.   
“We need to sit down and figure out how this is going to work,” Armacost said at Tuesday’s meeting. He acknowledged that there would be pressure from Grand Forks residents who would prefer to use UND for dual credit over Lake Region. 
Carmen Simone, who was appointed Lake Region president earlier in the meeting after serving as interim over the summer, said the college would work with UND. “I’m not afraid of this change,” Simone said. 
How dual credit works 
Lisa Johnson, deputy commissioner for the North Dakota University System, said in an interview that students generally take a dual-credit course one of two ways — either in person within their  high school or as an online course. 
In-person classes at the high school are taught by a high school instructor who has the required credentials, such as a master’s degree and a certain number of college credit hours in the subject area. 
For online courses, Johnson said those are typically taught by a college instructor. She said that option, while more expensive, is popular in rural school districts that won’t have enough students to justify an in-person class. Students from several schools can be grouped together for an online class, which can still take place during regular school hours. 
The North Dakota University System has targeted dual-credit offerings to high-demand classes, such as English 101 and college algebra that can help fulfill general education requirements and are easily transferable through North Dakota’s colleges.

Johnson said earning college credit through NDSU or UND, the state’s two research colleges, would carry no more weight than through a smaller college, though that perception might exist. 
“I think the extent to which they no longer enroll in community colleges and four-year regionals and gravitate to research institutions remains to be seen,” she said. 
Johnson said a high school can partner with more than one college on dual-credit classes. 
If two colleges were offering the same course, Johnson said the high school would select which institution to partner with. 
Growth in dual credit
Johnson said dual credit has evolved over the decades. She said it started with the two-year colleges such as Lake Region and the State College of Science back in the 1980s. 
Four-year colleges eventually began offering dual credit courses, and online courses have greatly expanded dual-credit opportunities. 
“We actually have hundreds and hundreds of online courses,” Johnson said. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Johnson said growth also was spurred when the state Legislature approved funding for a scholarship program in 2021. The scholarship provides $250 per course, up to three courses. 
“We really saw a marked increase in students participating in dual credit after the announcement of that dual credit scholarship,” Johnson said. 
There also is a program through the Bank of North Dakota to cover dual-credit tuition for families who qualify for free and reduced school meals. 
Johnson said a goal of Brent Sanford, who was just named the University System’s commissioner, to expand dual-credit offerings at high schools with career and technical education centers. 
High school students have other options for earning college credit. Under early entry, a high school can take a college course that may not count toward high school graduation. Students also can take advanced placement classes, which may provide college credit depending on the student’s score on a standardized test. 
Bertolini  said an average student coming to NDSU already has 12 college credits, typically through dual credit, and he expects that to keep growing.  
“It’s one way to lower college expenses, reduce your time to degree,” Bertolini said. “It also allows them, in an earlier framework, to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado voters will be asked this fall to weigh in on two ballot measures concerning the state’s free school meals program, the only statewide contests in the 2025 off-year election.
Propositions LL and MM were referred to the ballot by the Colorado General Assembly earlier this year. Together, they aim to shore up funding for the Healthy School Meals For All program, which was authorized by Colorado voters in 2022 but has exceeded cost projections in its first years of operation.
Without additional funding, program administrators have said they will have to take steps to restrict eligibility to only low-income students and schools. Additional efforts to purchase locally-grown produce, increase wages for cafeteria workers and offset federal food stamp cuts would also go without funding.

Keep Kids Fed Colorado, an issue committee registered in support of Propositions LL and MM, has reported $152,000 in contributions, mostly from the nonprofit Hunger Free Colorado. The campaign touts a long list of endorsements from organizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network.
 Proposition LL
Three years ago, Colorado voters approved a ballot measure to create the school meals program, which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of their family’s income level. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year.
The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Proposition LL would allow the state to keep the $12.4 million in excess revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under the 1992 state constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights.
That money has already been collected by the state. If Proposition LL is approved, the state would keep it and spend it on the school meals program.
If Proposition LL is rejected, the money would be refunded to Colorado households making at least $300,000 a year. Roughly 200,000 filers in Colorado, representing the richest 6% of households, would receive an average refund of $62.
 Proposition MM
While Healthy School Meals For All initially raised more revenue than projected, the program’s costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by further limiting tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year, raising an additional $95 million annually for the program. Households in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly, according to nonpartisan state fiscal analysts.
The program’s budget gap has led to delays in implementing two supplementary programs that were also included in the 2022 ballot measure: grants for purchasing locally grown food from Colorado farmers and increased wages for cafeteria workers. If Proposition MM is approved, those provisions would be implemented.
During a special legislative session in August, Colorado lawmakers also tweaked Proposition MM to allow the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans in July.
 Colorado voting basics
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold certified the 2025 ballot on Sept. 8. In addition to the two statewide measures, the coordinated 2025 election will see voters decide on numerous candidates and issues at the local level, including municipal elections in Aurora, Pueblo and Fort Collins, and school board races in Denver, Aurora, Douglas County and many other districts across the state.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com.
Mail ballots will be sent to all active registered voters in Colorado beginning Oct. 10, and any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)COLUMBIA — Older teens and adults don’t need a prescription to get a COVID-19 vaccine in South Carolina, a state committee clarified this month.
The decision came days before a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel rejected a proposal that would have required anyone getting the vaccine first go to their doctor for a prescription.
The CDC committee still wants people to consult a health care provider about the vaccine’s risks and benefits. Following guidance for “shared clinical decision-making” could involve calling a primary care physician. People could also simply talk to the pharmacist on duty when they go get their shot, NPR reported.
However, the committee’s recommendations await formal approved by the acting CDC director.
South Carolina’s protocol for administering vaccines, updated by the Board of Medical Examiners during a Sept. 15 meeting, takes other medical groups’ recommendations into account. So, a change in CDC recommendations wouldn’t automatically change South Carolina protocol.
For children, the state board followed the American Academy of Pediatrics in recommending at least one dose of the vaccine for children older than 6 months.
It followed the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in recommending the vaccine for pregnant women.
State protocol calls for the vaccine to be available for all adults and recommends two booster shots for people 65 and older.
In South Carolina, children younger than 16 need a doctor’s note and parental permission to get the COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy. The same is true for most immunizations. An exception is the flu vaccine, as per state law.
However, confusion persists over who can get the vaccine. Despite the updated protocols from the Board of Medical Examiners, effective Sept. 17, whether a shot is available will depend on the pharmacy. CVS is offering COVID-19 shots at its South Carolina pharmacies without a prescription, a spokesman said. Walgreens is not, according to its website.
Part of that confusion may come from the CDC committee’s recommendations differing from U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In August, the FDA approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with high-risk health issues. While the FDA regulates vaccines, the CDC recommends how to use them.
Most insurance plans should cover the COVID-19 shot, though major pharmacies’ websites recommend double checking before coming in for an appointment.
Medicaid and Medicare will cover the cost of the vaccines, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Many private health insurance companies promised to keep all CDC-recommended vaccines free for people on their plans through the end of 2026, according to a statement from American Health Insurance Plans, which includes major health insurance providers.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

(Photo courtesy of KNOE-TV)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center in West Monroe, Louisiana, alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. 
Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. 
Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track makes clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels … to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners.
“Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states declared bankruptcy in January. 
“I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. 
But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust, a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. Medical Properties Trust bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with Medical Properties Trust and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. 
In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give federal regulators an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. 
Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to Medicare about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at Medicare’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did.
Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. 
One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from receiving payment for services. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of West Monroe with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

(Photo courtesy of First Choice Services)By the time Beth Roach reached out to West Virginia’s Problem Gambling Help Network last year, her gambling addiction had already cost her relationships, her job, her vehicle and her house. It nearly cost her her life. 
“I knew that I had two choices: I could either get help or I was going to end my life,” Roach said. 
When she messaged the 1-800-Gambler helpline, Roach was connected to counseling and other resources for her addiction. 
“I’ll never forget — I chatted in on a Friday afternoon and I saw my counselor on Saturday morning,” she said. “They got me in that quick.”
This year marks the 25th anniversary for the Problem Gambling Help Network, which runs the state’s 24-hour 1-800-Gambler helpline. The network is operated by First Choice Services and funded through the West Virginia Lottery.
Last year the program helped connect about 1,500 people with help for their gambling addiction, said Sheila Moran, marketing and communications director for First Choice Services.
“….Every state has a 1-800-Gambler,” Moran said. “What we do is a little different than other states — we have a pretty comprehensive treatment program.”
Helpline employees offer caller crisis counseling and connect them to an array of treatment services, ranging from podcasts, self-help books and apps, on up to more formal mental health help, Moran said. 
“Some people are ready for serious treatment, and so in that case, we link them with one of our counselors who are trained in treating gambling addiction, and we pay for that treatment,” she said. “And they can go up to 20 times to see them.”
The network also offers occasional retreats where people interested in gambling addiction recovery can gather in person for two days at a state park or another venue to connect with others and with treatment counselors. 
A retreat was where Roach’s treatment really took off, she said.
“[The retreat was] where I really started doing better in my recovery,” she said. “Because at that point, when I went to that retreat, I was just barely getting through every day.”
The network’s website has information and a quiz to help people determine whether their gambling is a problem. The best indication, Moran said, is if people continue to gamble even though it has negative consequences, she said.
“We’ll get calls from people who say, ‘how can I have a gambling problem? I’m well off. I’m wealthy.’ Well, it’s really not about the money,” she said. “If you keep gambling, even though your wife is mad at you and you’ve lost your job, that’s a problem. So that’s kind of a global definition of addiction.”
At least one in 50 West Virginians struggle with problem gambling, according to the network. 
Often, people will start with safer gambling — setting rules and limits for themselves. Then they’ll break those limits, lose money they never intended to, and start gambling more to make up for that loss, she said. 
“That’s when it first starts to cross over, when people go from recreational gambling to maybe problematic gambling, especially when they start seeing it as a way to make money,” she said. 
Roach started gambling in 2017 after visiting a casino. The casino became something for her and her husband, then empty nesters, to do on weekends. But the weekend trips turned into every weekend. 
Then, she’d go throughout the week and she started going on her own, spending more and more money. 
“I would say within four months, it had become a problem, and not to the point of the problem that it was when I stopped gambling,” Roach said. “But it was a problem because I was going more than just recreation. I was spending a little bit more, and it was just too much time… it was more of a time thing.”
In Roach’s case, a medication she was prescribed for restless leg syndrome has been linked to compulsive behavior, including gambling. She only learned of the connection afterwards in counseling.
The most common types of gambling have changed through the years, Moran said. When the network first started in 2000, most people were calling about slot machines, then video poker parlors, she said. Nowadays, callers are mostly betting online. 
In the last few years, the helpline’s call volume has doubled, mostly because of young men calling about online sports betting, she said. 
“We’re getting a whole lot of calls from young men who, frankly, I never thought would call us, because I thought, ‘Oh, they’re not going to call a helpline,’” Moran said. “I was wrong. So now they’re making up a lot of our calls.”
Last year the program had about 1,500 intakes, which are actually people seeking help for their gambling problem. She distinguishes between intakes and calls because a lot of callers are mistakenly trying to reach customer service for whatever gambling organization they’re using. 
The number of intakes is up from 1,200 last year, and has doubled in the last five years because of online gambling, she said.
“It’s not only more access but of course there’s a lot of advertising,” she said of online gambling. “Years ago, there was some stigma, maybe, attached to the idea of going to a casino and gambling. I think that’s completely gone now, especially among young folks. So we’ll just see more and more of them gambling on a regular basis.”
Moran said a significant number of calls — 20 or 30% — come from the loved ones of people struggling with a gambling addiction. Sometimes spouses will find out their wives or husbands have cashed the couple’s retirement funds, or taken out a second mortgage, or racked up a bunch of credit card debt without their knowledge. 
“You can imagine how upset they are when they call us,” Moran said. “And so a lot of what our counselors do is probably some marriage therapy in addition to gambling addiction therapy. But we can help them as well, because sometimes they need a bunch of emotional protection, but some solid steps to take to protect themselves financially. 
“So we have financial counseling available to them as well as the gambler,” she said. 
Short of the telltale signs of losing their homes and 401Ks, Moran said lying is one sign a person may have a problem with gambling addiction. But it can be very difficult to tell, she said. 
“If you are with someone, and they do gamble on a regular basis, it’s worth having a financial conversation and maybe even looking into some of these accounts, as far as where the money is going,” Moran said. “If someone’s deceptive about it, it can be very hard.

About a year into treatment, Roach, 52, is still working to get her life back on track. She attends a support group, meets with a sponsor and still gets counseling regularly. 
She now works as a helpline coordinator at the same helpline that helped pull her out of her addiction. 
“I tell [Program Director Maricel Bernardoall] the time, how thankful I am for her for taking a chance on me, because I’m still kind of early in my recovery. But it’s helped me,” Roach said. “I mean, I’ve put in work in other areas, but it helps me. It helps me just as much as I help others.”

She admired her social studies and English teachers especially. After four years studying elementary education at Delta State University and a full-time teaching position in a local district her senior year, she felt she had cleared all the important hurdles to becoming a certified teacher in Mississippi.

But then came PRAXIS, a series of tests that nearly every teacher in Mississippi must take to become a certified teacher. 
“It made me second guess a career that I fell in love with,” she said. “Much of what I learned over the four years of college is not in the practice material.”
She’s not alone. In roughly half of public and private universities with education programs, 50% or more of students do not pass at least one section of the PRAXIS exam on their first try.
Some students even opted for more classes at school to bypass having to take the test, which would mean an additional $1,200 for Allen.
Nearly a quarter of the 1,892 Mississippi test takers walked away after flunking on the first attempt of the most commonly taken PRAXIS Elementary Education exam from 2015 to 2018, leaving fewer teachers to fill a growing list of teacher vacancies in critical shortage areas.
The Board of Education implemented a waiver during the pandemic to allow students to be certified without taking the PRAXIS, but that waiver ended in December 2021. Students graduating as late as December 2023 took advantage of the waiver.
Now university education departments, school district officials and teachers are struggling to re-adjust to a more rigid path to teacher licensure.
“It’s outrageous that effective educators are dismissed by the profession for not passing PRAXIS,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former public school principal in Greenville and executive director of the West Mississippi Education Consortium. “Many prove their impact while on emergency licenses, only to be fired then immediately rehired as a long-term substitute – doing the same work for a fraction of the pay, with no benefits or retirement.”
“We must do better.”
Shortage areas

Didriquez Smith has taken the PRAXIS content test three times and spent nearly a thousand dollars. He coaches football at Clarksdale High School and teaches physical education on an emergency license.
He failed just one of the three tests in his past two attempts: Foundations of Reading, which covers reading comprehension and teaching reading.
The Praxis exam has several parts. The content knowledge test covers the subject aspiring teachers want to teach, like biology or elementary English. The Principles of Learning test covers how teachers should prepare lesson plans and approach classroom instruction for different subjects. Students who don’t have at least a 3.0 GPA must also take an Academic Skills for Educators test, which is also called PRAXIS Core.
Per try, the elementary education exam costs $209, and the PRAXIS core test $90. Some of the content tests such as art instruction cost $130.
Smith had to travel nearly 300 miles to Birmingham to take his third attempt at the test because the test wasn’t offered closer at the end of the school year. He is currently saving up enough money to take it again.
He loves his job, particularly informing his community about the importance of healthy habits. 
He hopes he can continue to keep students healthy and active at school. In the Mississippi Delta, the obesity rate among children is 29%.
However, if he can’t pass each required PRAXIS test in the next year, he may be out of a job. As much as his boss in the principal’s office may want to keep him in his role, state regulations penalize schools in their annual accountability scores if they have faculty teaching without a license. Schools can also lose accreditation.
Since childhood, Skylar Ball had planned on becoming a kindergarten teacher. She followed her mother into education, even attending the same alma mater of Blue Mountain Christian University. 
“Teaching elementary school is like Disney World,” she said. “Elementary students, you can do so much with them. You can make an early impact.”
However, one and a half years after graduation, she remains an assistant teacher, making several thousand less a month than she budgeted for while she saves enough money to take the PRAXIS exam for the third time. 
She was two questions shy of passing on her latest attempt.
“I was so blessed to educate 20 amazing kindergartners last school year under an emergency license … I am currently a paraprofessional in an amazing district, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t upset about not being able to lead a classroom of my own,” Ball said.
She struggled with the Elementary Education exam, a PRAXIS test with the lowest pass rate in the state. Although she was aiming to become a kindergarten English teacher, her test covered kindergarten through sixth grade instruction as well as science, math, art, English, and social studies, among other subjects.
In an analysis conducted by the National Teacher Quality Association, the nonprofit found that Mississippi’s Elementary Education content test has a subpar job measuring whether would-be teachers have the knowledge and skills needed for a career in their classrooms.
“Does this test tell districts if they are prepared to lead an elementary school classroom in this content area? It does not,” said Hannah Putman, managing director of research at the National Council of Teacher Quality.
The university’s role
Universities in Mississippi play an important role in filling teacher vacancies with fresh talent. Pass rates on PRAXIS exams vary among universities with Alcorn State University posting the lowest first-time pass rates, according to the most recent data from 2022-2023 school year. Mississippi Valley State University posted that none of its students took two of the three main PRAXIS exams for the same year.
This data has a smaller sample size of teachers as a majority gained licensure under the  COVID waiver.
Mississippi College posted the best results with over 93% of students passing the pedagogy section test and 100% of students passing both the content test and the Foundations of Reading test. Over 90% of University of Southern Mississippi students passed their three PRAXIS exams.

Timolin Howard, a Mississippi Valley State graduate, doesn’t regret enrolling in the school’s masters in teaching program. She believes instructors have given her the tools to succeed in the classroom.
After finding out her test scores were insufficient for licensure, she had a stroke. She also says she received mixed messaging from the state licensure board regarding cut-off scores.
“I found that, while I was well-prepared for real-world teaching, I wasn’t fully prepared for the demands of the certification exams,” she said.
She said she can manage students, build lesson plans and come up with classroom activities that help students master common core competencies. But Howard realized she had gaps in her foundational knowledge when it came to studying for the PRAXIS exams. She reached out to her school for help.
The university cancelled a workshop taught on campus, which was preparing students for the Foundations of Reading exam. It wasn’t the first a PRAXIS preparation workshop was cancelled, Howard said.
“It left me feeling overwhelmed as I tried to catch up, and it significantly impacted my confidence, academic performance and health,” she said.
This year, her Delta school district released her from her contract because she lacked the right licensure.
Mississippi Valley State University’s education department did not respond to comment despite repeated attempts to reach representatives.
Grow Your Own
For eight years, Adrienne Hudson has led the nonprofit organization RISE, which helps recruit and retain new teachers in Mississippi Delta school districts.
Hudson had already been informally mentoring and tutoring teachers who struggled with the PRAXIS exam and other technical aspects of licensure in her Clarksdale school. She founded RISE to help more.
Hudson takes pride in the start of performance-based licensure in her district. Letting teachers become certified teachers through improving test scores in state-tested subjects will help schools retain talented teachers, said Hudson of the new path to teacher certification.
“Some of the responsibilities are on the university and some are the systems that require the test to be the measuring stick for becoming a teacher,” she said. “We have students getting dean’s list, who can’t pass the test.”
More would-be teachers are going back to school later in life than ever before. Fewer teachers are entering the traditional route, which involves majoring in education as an undergraduate as opposed to the alternate route through a masters. In the 2018-2019 school year, 27% of students getting an education degree went the alternate route in 2022-2023, 45% did.
Tony Latiker, dean of Jackson State University’s school of education, saw a similar trend. He theorizes the reason so many students are going the alternative route is because of the many requirements that await undergraduates at the end of their four years. Alternative route students have fewer testing requirements to meet.
One solution he has found is to have traditional route students take exams closer to when they finish coursework that corresponds. For example, he encourages students to take the Foundations of Reading exam after they complete their early literacy courses, which are offered in some form at all Mississippi universities with an education program.
Jackson State also offers an elective that prepares students for the PRAXIS tests and other technical requirements of licensure. Professors and visiting instructors also host workshops on campus.
“We really should be questioning the exams,” Latiker told Mississippi Today. “I’m not against the exams and testing, but I’m against them being the high stakes tests they are. It should be a part of a more holistic process, incorporating district personnel and university faculty input in classrooms, assessing pre-service teachers and interns at the end of lessons, to see if they’re actually effective.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05170616/makeshift-ESL-classroom-Flowood.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

(Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)LOUISVILLE – The appearance of a double standard by college sports’ governing body is raising hopes the University of Louisville’s 2013 NCAA basketball championship can be restored.
UofL athletics director Josh Heird told the Kentucky Lantern he has been in contact with NCAA President Charlie Baker about revisiting the Cardinals’ vacated title and been encouraged by indications the NCAA is open to reconciling inconsistencies in its penalty structure.
The source of Heird’s newfound optimism are penalties imposed last month on the University of Michigan’s football program, which did not include any vacated victories despite scouting and signal-stealing violations far more likely to affect games than did the stripper scandal that invalidated Louisville’s title.
Josh Heird (UofL photo)
“I think the Michigan case is the first case where we can really point to the precedent and say we’ve been treated unfairly,” UofL’s Heird said. “You have an institution that actively put a scheme together to gain a competitive advantage by cheating, but they (the NCAA) didn’t take their championship banner away. That seems very unfair.”
The chair of the hearing panel in the Michigan case said no Wolverines victories, including the 2024 College Football Playoff championship, were vacated because NCAA rules preclude such penalties in cases where infractions did not result in athletes being ruled ineligible. 
“That was not a factor present in this case,” said the chair, attorney Norman Bay, in explaining the sanctions. “So it was not a penalty, in other words, that could be considered. And we did not impose it.”
Still, to the extent that distinction fails to account for the competitive impact of Michigan’s extensive and impermissible scouting and sign-stealing versus the sexual shenanigans in Louisville’s basketball dorm, the two cases reinforce long-standing complaints about the consistency of NCAA justice. 
Moreover, though the Committee on Infractions acknowledged a postseason ban was required in the Michigan case due to the severity of the infractions, the school’s lack of cooperation and its repeat offender status, a financial penalty was substituted for that sanction because “a postseason ban would unfairly penalize student-athletes for the actions of coaches and staff who are no longer associated with the Michigan football program.”
“Ultimately, Michigan was accused of some pretty egregious violations,” said attorney Jason Setchen, who has represented numerous athletes in NCAA cases, notably former Louisville basketball recruit Brian Bowen. “And what was different about (Michigan’s) violations was there were a lot of allegations about on-field advantages. It has been argued by some that it affected their getting to the championship game and winning it.
“I don’t believe that those were the same allegations in the Louisville case.”
Though Baker, the NCAA president, initially insisted, “No one believes at this point that Michigan didn’t win the national title fair and square,”  the Committee on Infractions found evidence of 52 games involving future opponents Michigan had improperly scouted and concluded those efforts “likely provided a competitive advantage” and that “the true scope and scale of the scheme – including the competitive advantage it conferred – will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction of materials and information.”

By contrast, Louisville loyalists have long argued that providing strippers and prostitutes to players and recruits (many of them underage) was clearly tawdry but not tactical; that it had no bearing on basketball games and provided no discernible recruiting advantage. 
“They had strippers in the dorm room,” Heird said. “From a morality standpoint, all those things, not a good look. From an extra benefits standpoint, from directly impacting a game, irrelevant. So you’re going to tell me that a program can devise a plan to actively find ways to get a competitive advantage and that’s not going to be punished as much as what we were?”
The NCAA did not respond to multiple interview requests for Baker or another executive to speak to UofL’s concerns. In response to an open records request for recent correspondence related to the vacated 2013 title, Sherri Pawson, UofL’s senior compliance officer, reported, “We have not identified any responsive records.”
Given the disparity in punishments between Michigan and Louisville and the open wound UofL’s vacated title represents to many Cardinal fans, the lack of a formal response to the Michigan sanctions more than a month later was curious. Heird explained that he prefers to make his case by telephone rather than by creating a paper trail and, more importantly, that his calls have found a receptive ear in Baker.
“I think the leadership of the NCAA right now is very reasonable,” he said. “I think they understand that college athletics has changed dramatically. And so, do I think there’s an opening? Yes, I do.”
An NCAA panel denied Louisville’s appeal of its 2017 sanctions on Feb. 20, 2018, which would normally be the last word on the subject. Yet NCAA bylaw 19.14.4 allows any institution or involved individual to initiate a review by submitting a brief to the Committee on Infractions hearing panel. The NCAA manual makes no mention of a statute of limitations regarding this approach.
Litigation is also an option. Three years after the NCAA vacated 112 of Penn State’s football victories among its sanctions for the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, a lawsuit filed by Joe Paterno’s family led to a settlement that restored Paterno’s status as major college football’s winningest coach.
When it last did battle in an NCAA infractions case, U of L spared few expenses, paying star attorney Neal Katyal $2,465 per hour to successfully defend the university against allegations concerning Brian Bowen’s recruitment. Heird is reluctant to take Louisville’s case to court, however, fearful that doing so might result in retribution that limits the city’s opportunities to host major NCAA events such as last year’s women’s volleyball finals and the 2027 men’s basketball first and second rounds at the KFC Yum Center. 
“Let’s ask the appropriate questions before we get into full – I guess I’ll call it ‘Whatever It Takes’ mode,’ ” Heird said. “I’ve never been an advocate of we’ll just sue our way to getting what we want. It doesn’t feel like that’s the right way to go. I want to have all of the appropriate conversations and see if we can get to a place where we can all agree.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A Philadelphia man’s conviction for openly carrying a gun has led Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court to reexamine a state law that treats firearm owners in the state’s largest city differently than in other parts of the commonwealth.
To carry a gun in Philadelphia, a person must have a concealed carry license, regardless of whether they carry it openly or not. That’s not a requirement in the state’s 66 other counties, where it’s legal to carry a gun without a permit as long as it’s plainly visible.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/29epphUFA-web-audio.mp3
 
Lawyers for Zaire Livingston have argued the state Uniform Firearms Act’s exception for Philadelphia violates the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. 
Livingstone was arrested after Philadelphia police saw him selling drugs to another person in a dark alley. He was charged with drug possession and possession with intent to distribute. He was also charged with violating the Uniform Firearms Act because he had a handgun tucked in his waistband. He pleaded guilty to drug possession and the gun charge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A panel of three Superior Court judges rejected that argument in Livingston’s initial appeal last December, upholding his convictions on other grounds. But scarcely six months later, a different three-judge panel reached the opposite conclusion in another case from Philadelphia.
Police arrested Riyaadh Sumpter after officers spotted him walking on a street with the grip of a handgun visibly protruding from his waistband. He was charged with and convicted of violating Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act.
On appeal, the panel found the law unconstitutional on an equal protection basis, because it places people in Philadelphia at a “special disadvantage in the exercise of their Second Amendment right.” Prosecutors failed to show a compelling interest that was served by the restriction that would justify the infringement of Sumpter’s right to bear arms, the decision said.
The disagreement within the Superior Court, the commonwealth’s frontline appeals court, would be reason enough for the Supreme Court to review the cases, Craig Storrs, executive director of Pennsylvania Gun Rights, said. 
But he and Adam Garber, executive director of CeaseFirePA, said there has been a wave of litigation around the country in the wake of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the scope of tougher gun laws in recent years.
“This is the court saying we’re taking a much closer look at these gun control laws and these carve outs, these special exemptions, we have,” Storrs said.
The Uniform Firearms Act has been on the books since 1972 and the restriction on openly carrying guns in Philadelphia has not been successfully challenged, Garber said.
And although the U.S. Supreme Court has issued two major opinions in the last 20 years that struck down state-level restrictions on gun ownership, Garber noted the justices have taken pains to make clear that they didn’t open the door to invalidate all local gun safety efforts.
Most recently in 2022, when a 6-3 majority struck down New York’s law requiring people applying for handgun permits to show a special need to defend themselves, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the decision would not bar states from imposing objective requirements for gun licensing.
In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh cited the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion in the court’s 2008 decision striking down the District of Columbia’s ban on handgun ownership.
“Maybe they’re trying to say there are reasonable restrictions under the Constitution and they’re thinking it’s time to define them properly,” Garber said.

The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, led by District Attorney Larry Krasner, is in the position of defending the state law in the appeal, but Garber noted it’s possible the city itself could join in support of the law. 
A spokesperson for Krasner said in a statement that unlicensed open carrying of firearms in public should be a violation in every Pennsylvania county.
“This matter could be resolved by new legislation, rather than the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, if Republicans in the state legislature applied violations of [Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act] to all counties across the state rather than unjustly singling out Philadelphia,” Krasner said.
While the state House is set to pass a suite of bills to tighten Pennsylvania gun laws this week, they don’t include an expansion of the concealed carry licence requirement to cover open carry. And in past sessions, when the GOP controlled both chambers, efforts to eliminate the concealed carry permit requirement altogether made it to former Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk, only to be vetoed.
In the Livingston case now before the state Supreme Court, the justices limited the question to whether the license requirement in Philadelphia violates Article 1 of the state constitution and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, both of which guarantee equal protection under the law.
In upholding Livingston’s conviction, the Superior Court judges said they were bound by a 2014 decision of the Superior Court that found the right of people in Philadelphia to openly carry firearms on the street without a license was not fundamental. Controlling the “staggeringly disproportionate” incidence of gun violence in Philadelphia was a legitimate state interest that justifies any infringement on rights, the court said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0843-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

It sits idle in a mostly low-income, historic part of town whose prosperous edges are dotted with expensive, modern apartments and homes.

Not too far from the empty Walgreen’s, the former Heritage Square Shopping Center is also idle. All stores are shuttered. The former retail center is surrounded by chain-linked fencing, wrapped tight even as potential customers fill hundreds of new apartments and condos nearby.
Residents in the area depended on the eclectic Food World and a Family Dollar store that operated in the shopping center.  When they closed more than a year ago along with the drug store, it created an improbable food desert near a part of Durham that has experienced unrivaled growth and unprecedented prosperity.  The store closures combined with federal cuts to safety net programs to ensure low income, elderly people don’t go hungry, has local organizations looking for community solutions to keep them fed.
At the 79-unit Veranda at Whitted School on East Umstead Street, the aging residents felt the loss of the stores immediately. The senior housing facility is in a repurposed school that once served Durham’s black children. It’s a short walk from the Walgreens and the shopping center. Now, the closest grocery store is a mile away, a Compare Foods on University Drive. The next closest option is a Food Lion on Fayetteville Street, nearly two miles away.
Both are long hikes for seniors, many of who do not own cars and some who use walkers. For some tenants, catching a city bus can present a challenge.
This month, The Integral Group, the Atlanta-based developer and owner of the Veranda at Whitted School, partnered with the Durham Housing Authority, CenterWell Primary Care Anywhere and Feed My Sheep of Durham Inc., to create an onsite food pantry to keep residents from having to “choose between a lengthy bus ride and a healthy meal.”

“We have some seniors who have more energy than you and me, but we do have some seniors who don’t drive, that have health conditions and the easier we can make things for them, the better,” Kimberly Williams, a project adviser for the Integral Group, told a reporter on a recent visit.
The food pantry is also a response to federal budget cuts that might impact tenants’ ability to feed themselves, Williams said.
“Even if some people might not need the food now, at some point they might,” Williams said. “With all of the cuts that are happening with food stamps and Medicaid and possibly SSI [Supplemental Security Income] benefits, I just want them [tenants] to know that it’s [food] available.”
Meals on Wheels and other agencies deliver food to tenants, Williams said, but those meals are perishable and sometimes go bad before tenants can finish them. It’s good to have the food pantry as an option to help sustain residents through the month, she said.
Williams got the idea for the food pantry after seeing a Facebook post about a pantry at J.J. Henderson Towers, a senior housing community operated by Durham Housing Authority.

“At some point, I want to do it [provide food] for the entire community, where if someone off the street needs food, we would set up something on a Saturday in that circle [in front of the building] and allow people to eat,” Williams said. “This world is getting tough.”
Williams is still working out the details about how food will be distributed with Feed My Sheep of Durham, but tenants told NC Newsline that they welcome the  food pantry.
‘We help each other’
“Oh, it means a lot,” said long-time tenant Regina Royster when asked about the pantry. “I’ve seen people and you can tell they need a little something [food] here and there and we help each other.”
The pantry is in an small room that wasn’t being used. Several shelving units are filled with cereal, pasta, dried beans and various canned goods. A refrigerator in the corner is nearly empty except for a few bottles of Gatorade and two cases of Ensure that a tenant donated during a reporter’s tour of the pantry.
“When I get my nourishments from the VA [Veterans Administration], they can kind of go overboard sometimes,” said James Mitchell, 72, an Army veteran. “This [the pantry] gives me an opportunity to share it with the residents.”

Mitchell has lived in the Veranda at Whitted School since it opened in 2017, and believes the apartment he occupies was his science classroom when he attended the school in the 1960s. He has a car and can travel to grocery stores but said some of his neighbors cannot.
“It [the closing of the stores] created an inconvenience for most people in my age bracket because we now have to travel,” Mitchell said. “We have some who don’t have transportation and some who do and we have to travel further out.”
Senior hunger a growing problem
Food insecurity among senior citizens is a growing concern for many organizations, particularly as the U.S. population aged 65 and older grows rapidly. The growth is driven by the the Baby Boomer generation. According to Population Reference Bureau, the number of Americans age 65 and older is projected to increase to 82 million by 2050.  There are currently more than 61 million people in the U.S. aged 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
As the population ages, they will need more health care services and assistance for government agencies and nonprofits that provide food and other necessities to help sustain them.
Amy Akroyd, director of development and communications for Meals on Wheels Wake County, noted that a report released by Feeding America a few years ago found that the Raleigh metropolitan area ranked high among the nation’s other metropolitan areas for senior hunger.
“So, we know that the constituency that we serve has certainly seen an increase in that need because of the way that things are going right now with food prices increasing, with fuel prices increasing,” Akroyd said. “Everyone’s just stretching their budgets to meet a greater and greater need every day.”

Meals on Wheels is 50% funded by the federal government. Program operators across the country were disappointed there was no funding increase to meet growing demand, Akroyd said.
“We were fortunate in that we were continued to be funded, but it was flat funded, so that extra push that we really needed to continue to meet the growing need is not quite there anymore,” Akroyd said. “We’re relying on our private community of donors, volunteers, supporters to continue to make sure that we can pay for the meals that are so desperately needed by our seniors.”
Determining the extent of hunger in America could become more difficult in the wake of a Trump administration decision to end the federal government’s annual report on hunger in America.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced that it is terminating future Household Food Security Reports, calling them “redundant, costly, politicized” that do “nothing more than fear monger.”
The 2024 report is scheduled for release Oct. 22. It will be the last under the Trump administration.
The decision to halt the annual hunger report follows the passage of the Trump administration tax cut and spending bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will kick 3 million people off of food stamps, which is also known as SNAP benefits.
“When you look at some of the things that are being cut in terms of certain entitlement  programs, SNAP has been cut, Medicare, Medicaid, they’re [seniors] are facing some tough choices,” Akroyd said. “Those are all services that our seniors rely on, so the less services that seniors have in their own day-to-day lives the more they’re going to find a need [for food] that we’re going to hopefully be able to fill.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)One of the first sights to greet travelers waiting to collect their bags at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport is a symbol for the Ocean State: A fully rigged sailboat, its hull and sails sporting the names of regional maritime companies.
Welcoming travelers is a replica of a Whitbread 30, a mainstay near the baggage claim exit since the terminal named for former Gov. Bruce Sundlun opened in 1996. Getting the boat inside the building during construction was hardly smooth sailing.
“We had to get it in there before they put the doors on,” recalled Tom Rich, former co-owner of New England Boatworks, now Safe Harbor New England Boatworks, in Portsmouth, which built the model. “To get it through the frame, we had to turn it on a 45-degree angle and then had to refinish it inside because it got scratched up coming through.”
Never meant to be seaworthy, the Whitbread is purely decorative. The same goes for a public art installation that for more than two decades has been a fixture at the gate entryway after passing through the airport’s security checkpoint. Titled “Islands,” it consists of two sets of laminated wooden arches in a ribcage shape, adorned by rows of wire-mounted acrylic pods that resemble mussels, petals, or lacquered fingernails.
But now “Islands” and the Whitbread must be moved in order to make way for a $64 million renovation planned at the Warwick airport. So too will a small, Depression-era dinghy built by one of the state’s historic shipwrights and installed underneath the replica sailboat. 
Only the dinghy will survive the move.
Letting go
Public art has a tendency to fade away, said Peter Stempel, the artist behind “Islands,” in a recent phone interview. So he never expected his art to live in T.F. Green forever.  
“Even incredibly famous artists like [Alexander] Calder and Picasso, their pieces get moved,” Stempel said. “Things have a way of either getting put into a back hallway or an odd corner, or disappearing.”
Stempel’s overhead, cresting sculptures have blue pods on one variation, and red on the other. From a distance, their shapes gather like a tiny grove of trees on the horizon. Since being installed in 2002, three years after the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA) awarded Stempel the $99,000 commission, “Islands” has provided a canopy and rendezvous point for travelers. Stempel said he often heard people say of the work, “That’s where I meet up with my family.”
“Islands” is scheduled to sink out of public view once renovations begin, as the walls near the artwork are going to be demolished. 
“I think the fact that that space has not been renovated in over 20 years is pretty remarkable,” Stempel said. “So it was always a possibility…There are very few buildings that change as much as airports.”
Boatmaker Rich, meanwhile, said his understanding had always been that the boat replica would forever be a part of the terminal. 
“People come to Rhode Island and think it’s an impressive thing — it kind of says who we are,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d get that thing out of there, I guess they could just cut it up.”
A 60-foot-tall water feature is going to be installed near baggage claim, right where the information desk and the Whitbread and a 13-foot “Amphicraft” dinghy next to it  are on display.
Other plans call for new flooring to replace the existing carpet in the atrium, new ticket counters and seating, and lighting intended to “create a sense of place,” according to a July 11 memo from airport CEO Iftikhar Ahmad to Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s board of directors. Terminal renovations are set to be completed by late 2027.
The idea, Ahmad wrote, is to build upon other cosmetic upgrades and amenities added to the airport in recent years, such as $10 million marble-lined bathrooms, automated coffee machines, new restaurants and colossal welcome signs off Interstate 95.
“I’m fully committed to transforming this place,” Ahmad told reporters after a recent board meeting.
The boat will likely need to be relocated, airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in an emailed statement. But where exactly it will go is still up in the air.
“Discussions related to the sailboat’s future remain ongoing,” Fischer said. “Once material submittals from the contractor come back to us for review, we will have more details on the final aesthetic.”
The overall goal of the renovations, Fischer said, is to borrow aesthetics from notable buildings in Newport and Providence.
Ahmad told reporters the decorative sailboat could be relocated, but it’s not a top priority for airport officials.
“There is no compulsion for us to do this right now,” he said. “Maybe we just see things differently as to what’s important to us.”

The last of the Herreshoffs
The Whitbread is just for show, but the Amphicraft dinghy constructed in the 1930s by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company — the Bristol boatbuilder that dominated the state’s marine industry from the 1870s through the 1940s — can sail the sea.
You wouldn’t immediately know from looking at the small Depression-era craft tucked behind the welcome desk, but it’s an important piece of sailing history, said Bill Lynn, president of the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Bristol.
“It’s sort of the first shot at a boat you could actually tow behind your car and take somewhere, set it up, throw it in the water,” Lynn explained. “It’s a pretty cool little boat — it’s this kind of LEGO kit.”
The Amphicraft dinghy is also extremely rare. Only 15 were ever made, according to the museum.
There actually used to be three Herreshoff boats within the terminal, Lynn said.
The first to leave the terminal was a 15-foot wooden racing boat commissioned by the Watch Hill Yacht Club in Westerly during the early 1920s. It was pulled from the terminal by the museum in order to get refurbished for its 100th birthday at the yacht club, Lynn said. Airport officials never asked for it back.
“Now it’s parked in Connecticut waiting for what happens next,” Lynn said.
Then in May, Lynn said he was informed by airport officials he would need to move a steam launch built in 1902 and originally commissioned by railroad tycoon Henry Clay Pierce to make way for the planned renovations.
That boat has since returned to the museum on Bristol’s Burnside Street. Lynn said he remains hopeful all Herreshoffs can come back to the terminal.
“We’re sort of twiddling our thumbs waiting to find out whether we can bring any of these boats back,” he said. “I sort of worry that’s not going to happen, which would be too bad.”

Out of the airport, into memory
The state arts council voted unanimously on Sept. 15 to OK the removal of Stempel’s “Islands” so the airport corporation can carry out its plans. 
Stempel, now an associate professor of landscape architecture at Penn State University, was a Rhode Island School of Design graduate living and working in Providence in 1998 when he won the approval of a RISCA panel charged with choosing artworks to accompany T.F. Green’s gate expansion. State law dictates that at least 1% of funding be devoted toward public artworks for state-invested capital projects whose budgets exceed $250,000.  
According to Providence Journal coverage from 1998, Stempel’s sculpture — whose shapes reference “grape arbors…[and] shaded patios” and “upside-down boats” — was chosen by a 6-4 vote over a set of eight hanging shell-shaped sculptures. The panel debated its final choice at length, with some finding Stempel’s sculpture overly bold. 
“Those colors are just too shocking,” one RISCA board member lamented at the time.










I’m fully committed to transforming this place.


– Rhode Island Airport Corporation CEO Iftikhar Ahmad


The artwork is site-specific, meaning it was designed and fabricated to accommodate the precise location where it would be installed. The airport’s challenge to Stempel was to fill the slots atop a wall that had once been occupied by planters, but staff found upkeep of the live plants too demanding, Stempel said.
“They also didn’t want you to disrupt the advertising that was in the terminal — part of the terminal revenue,” Stempel said. “These are all the things that public artists deal with all the time.”
Stempel eventually noticed the “lens of space” between the install site and the surrounding advertising. A canopy, he decided, could elegantly fill the space and look sufficiently different from the ads that it couldn’t be mistaken for one. So Stempel installed the colorful arcs and bulbs from 2 to 5 a.m. on a morning in 2002, when post-Sept. 11 security measures were still fresh. 
“Every single piece of it went through a metal detector,” Stempel recalled. 
Stempel wonders how many people saw his sculpture over the years, although he estimates it’s a “tremendous number” given the high foot traffic in the area. The artist praised RISCA for its commitment to public art and said that “Islands” formed a milestone in his career.
“The difference between doing a $20,000 sculpture and doing a $100,000 sculpture in those years was incredibly significant,” Stempel said. “It’s really what allowed me to transition to being much more professional.”
But Stempel does not want the sculpture back as a “souvenir.” After RISCA informed him of the deaccession, Stempel waived his contractual right of recovery to the state-owned “Islands.” 
His preference is that the work would be destroyed. “It’s really very difficult to recover it in a meaningful way,” he said.
The removal process can begin once renovation permits have been obtained. 
“With site specific artwork such as ‘Islands,’ this typically means deconstructing and disposing of the artwork outside of public view so the public memory of the piece as a complete artwork is maintained,” Todd Trebour, RISCA’s executive director wrote in a Sept. 23 email.
“Remove it and demolish it with dignity,” Stempel said. “And then it will go into memory and history.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Kentucky’s demographic data paints a stark picture of Eastern Kentucky’s future. Letcher, Knott, Perry, and Harlan counties are among the fastest shrinking in Appalachia. Across the border in Virginia, Buchanan County is projected to lose nearly half its population by 2050, but the pattern in Kentucky’s coal counties is identical: Young people leave, older residents remain, and the math no longer supports schools, clinics, or small businesses. 
As one observer put it, “There are more hearses headed to the cemetery than moving vans pulling into the driveway.”
Yet buried in the demographic projections was a crucial caveat: Their forecasts could prove “too dire if people start moving into the region.” In other words, decline is not destiny. The question is how to reverse the exodus and transform Eastern Kentucky from a region people leave into one they choose to call home.
Recent floods underscore the urgency. In July 2022, torrential rain killed 45 people and forced families from their homes in Knott, Breathitt, and Perry counties — part of a pattern of repeated disasters that make rebuilding in the hollows increasingly untenable. Despite billions of dollars in federal investment since the 1960s, from highways to retraining programs, the region continues bleeding people and opportunity.
A Homestead Act for Eastern Kentucky

The problem runs deeper than jobs. It’s about land — who controls it, where homes can safely be built, and whether working families have secure, affordable ground beneath their feet.
A framework already in place
For years, I’ve advocated for a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia — not as nostalgia for the Homestead Act of 1862 but as a practical strategy built on existing legal and institutional frameworks. The tools for transformative land reform already exist; what’s missing is the political will to coordinate them at scale.
Kentucky passed land bank legislation that allows localities to create public land banks that can acquire tax-delinquent or abandoned properties and prepare them for productive reuse. Louisville has already pioneered one of the nation’s largest and most active land banks, demonstrating how city governments can move neglected properties back into productive use. 
Community Land Trusts (CLTs), pioneered in Georgia and operating successfully in rural Tennessee since the 1970s, keep land affordable while preventing speculation. 
Federal brownfields law shields new property owners from environmental liability when proper cleanup protocols are followed. Most importantly, billions in federal funding for mine reclamation, infrastructure development, and climate-resilient housing are already flowing through existing programs.
The legal infrastructure exists. The funding mechanisms are operational. What we need now is a comprehensive implementation plan.
The blueprint: 3 million acres across Appalachia
Here’s how a regional Homestead Act could work in practice, focusing initially on Eastern Kentucky while coordinating with similar efforts across the broader Appalachian coalfields.
A federal-state partnership administered through the Appalachian Regional Commission would target three categories of property for acquisition. Thousands of acres of reclaimed surface-mined land, already reforested under federal reclamation requirements, could be developed for housing, renewable energy or agroforestry systems.  Secondly, corporate-owned undisturbed land, much of it controlled by coal and timber companies, includes rich soils and abundant water resources; with companies facing bankruptcy or divestment pressures, prime tracts could be secured at below-market prices. 
Finally, underused federal holdings such as portions of national forests could be designated for homestead development, especially on higher ground suitable for climate-resilient communities.
Initial capitalization of $100 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would support land acquisition, supplemented by state contributions and private partnerships. Funding could be raised through several methods. Strategic auctions at bankruptcy sales of distressed coal company assets would allow large tracts to be secured cheaply by government agencies and conservation groups. Negotiated sales with struggling corporations could provide tax benefits and structured payments in exchange for below-market land transfers. Land swaps would allow governments to trade less desirable holdings for prime private land needed for homestead development. Green bonds, issued by states or municipalities and backed by federal guarantees, would finance large-scale land acquisition and infrastructure expansion.

The program would offer 10- to 40-acre plots to eligible participants at nominal cost, in some cases as little as $100 to $500 per acre for reclaimed mining land, with higher prices for greenfield properties. To encourage long-term settlement, families would receive 10-year property tax exemptions, giving them time to establish farms and businesses before local taxes phased in.
 Development incentives would include relocation grants, low-interest loans for housing and agriculture, and five-year income tax exemptions for those committing to stay a decade or more. Each community would also be guaranteed modern infrastructure: improved roads, stormwater management and reliable broadband access.
If divided conservatively into 30-acre parcels, Kentucky’s potential 1.3 million acres could support over 43,000 homesteads — enough to stabilize population decline and lay the foundation for renewal.
Eligibility and priority systems
Three categories of participants would be eligible for the homestead program. The first would be families already living in Appalachia but seeking safer, more affordable housing or land for small-scale farming and business development. The second would be returning members of the Appalachian diaspora who left the region for work but could now return thanks to remote employment and homestead incentives. The third would be newcomers from outside Appalachia prepared to commit long-term to farming, renewable energy, health care education, or small business.
Priority would be given to applicants who pledge at least 15 years of residency, to families with children who would stabilize rural schools, and to those with agricultural or entrepreneurial skills most likely to contribute to long-term community development.
Infrastructure as foundation
Modern homesteading requires 21st century infrastructure. Every homestead community would be developed above the 100-year floodplain, ensuring safety while saving taxpayers from repeated disaster recovery costs. High-ground development would be paired with advanced stormwater systems using retention ponds, permeable surfaces, and native landscaping.
 Universal broadband would connect each home with fiber-optic service capable of supporting remote work, online learning and e-commerce. Cooperative service networks, rooted in Appalachian traditions of mutual aid, would allow communities to pool resources for equipment, purchasing, marketing, child care, and elder care — lowering costs and strengthening resilience.
Economic development through land use
Economic growth would be driven by land use tailored to the region’s landscape.
 Specialty agriculture such as orchards and vineyards could revive Eastern Kentucky’s fruit-growing heritage and expand into grape production for wine and juice. Agroforestry systems would combine tree crops with pasture, providing multiple income streams while restoring ecosystems. Controlled-environment agriculture — greenhouses and high vertical structures — would allow year-round vegetable and herb production. Non-timber forest products, from ginseng to mushrooms, could build on traditional mountain practices. 
Carbon forestry, replanting blight-resistant chestnuts and native hardwoods, would generate steady revenue through carbon credit markets. Value-added processing in food plants, sawmills and craft workshops would ensure local producers capture more of the wealth they create. Finally, tourism and recreation — from farm stays to outdoor adventure — would capitalize on the region’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.
Governance through democratic land trusts
Community land trusts would be the foundation of governance. Families would own their homes and improvements, but the trust would retain ownership of the land to prevent speculation. Resale formulas would ensure housing remained affordable across generations, while community assemblies would make decisions on infrastructure, land use, and cooperative ventures.
The role of educational institutions
Kentucky’s universities and colleges must serve as technical assistance and training hubs. The University of Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky University could lead mine land reclamation, agriculture, and engineering. Berea College could provide civic, cultural and organizational leadership, consistent with its historic mission to serve Appalachia. Together, they would create a research and training network to support homesteaders.
Learning from precedent
Gov. Andy Beshear’s response to Eastern Kentucky’s devastating 2022 floods demonstrates climate-resilient relocation in practice. Eight new high-ground communities are being built across the coalfields, including the Skyview neighborhood in Hazard. “We cannot keep putting people back in the same places and expect a different outcome,” Beshear said at one groundbreaking.

This model — relocating families to safer ground while building modern infrastructure — could be replicated across Appalachia. Other examples, from Valmeyer, Illinois, to Scotland’s Isle of Eigg, show how coordinated relocation and community ownership can create vibrant new settlements.
Economic impact and fiscal benefits
A comprehensive homestead program would generate significant economic activity throughout Eastern Kentucky. Initial infrastructure development — roads, broadband, water systems and housing — would create thousands of construction jobs in the first decade. Using conservative estimates of $150,000 per homestead for housing and infrastructure, 43,000 Kentucky homesteads would generate over $6 billion in construction activity.
Small business development would follow. If half of all homesteads created enterprises averaging $25,000 annually, that would represent more than $500 million in new economic activity. The property tax base would expand as reclaimed land bought for $500 an acre and improved with housing, barns and orchards reached assessed values of $3,000 to $5,000 per acre within a decade. Meanwhile, stronger employment and population growth would reduce demands on social services, stabilizing schools, clinics, and local governments.
Implementation timeline
The program would roll out in phases. Pilot projects in two or three Eastern Kentucky counties during the first two years would establish proof of concept. Regional expansion in years three through five would scale the model to thousands of homesteads. Full implementation in a decade would integrate Kentucky’s coalfields into a broader multi-state homestead strategy.
Monitoring and accountability
A modern homestead initiative must be accountable. Annual monitoring would measure job creation, business formation, income growth and rising property values. Demographic trends such as school enrollment, age distribution and family formation would show whether the program is attracting and retaining young residents. Environmental monitoring would track soil restoration, water quality, biodiversity and carbon sequestration to ensure development improves rather than degrades ecosystems. 
Community development indicators — participation in cooperatives, civic organizations and cultural programs — would reveal whether homesteads are building stronger, more resilient communities.
Beyond economic development: proving ground for democracy
The homestead program’s value extends beyond economics. By returning land and decision-making power to families, it strengthens the democratic foundations of rural life. It offers a path to renewal based on ownership, responsibility and cooperation.
Conclusion: from decline to renewal
Decline is not destiny if people start moving back to the region. A modern Homestead Act provides the framework, incentives, and community structures to make that migration not just possible but attractive.
The total new investment dollars I am proposing are small compared to the amounts the country has spent on other relief projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission’s designation of Central Appalachia is 60 mainly coalfield counties in four states: Southwest Virginia, Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Eastern Tennessee. The 2020 census showed a population of 1,852,312 but declining. 
ARC designates 80% of those 60 counties as economically “distressed” out of the 118 distressed counties in all of Appalachia. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the U.S. spent $120.5 billion restoring New Orleans and the Gulf region. The total population there was 1.4 million. The total benefit to the nation in restoring the Appalachian coalfields far outweighs the projected costs.
The tools exist. The funding streams are available. The communities are ready. What’s needed now is the political will to coordinate these resources at the scale the challenge demands.
Eastern Kentucky stands at a crossroads. One path leads to continued decline, aging communities and economic stagnation. The other leads to renewal, sustainable prosperity, and communities that can weather any storm.
The choice is ours. The time is now. The land is waiting.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Two years after a nail-biting finish, Democrat Lily Franklin and Del. Chris Obenshain, the Republican incumbent, are locked in a rematch in Virginia’s House of Delegates District 41 — a contest that could again turn on handfuls of ballots in a district that blends the university-anchored towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg with more rural and suburban precincts of Roanoke and Montgomery counties. In 2023, Obenshain edged Franklin by just 183 votes.
As the campaign intensifies, both candidates cast themselves as uniquely suited to serve a district in flux — Franklin promising generational change and connection to working-class struggles, Obenshain touting continuity, legislative experience and a record of concrete wins. 
House District 41 is one of the state’s more demographically dynamic districts. It has a comparatively low median age, a substantial proportion of renter-occupied housing, and a mix of precincts that swing between college-town and exurban voters. The district also leans slightly toward competitive balance in recent elections — a swing seat more often than not — making it a bellwether for broader trends in Southwest Virginia politics.
According to data from the Virginia Public Access Project, money underscores the high stakes of this year’s election cycle. Obenshain had raised $490,440 through Aug. 31 and booked $782,602 in political ads set to run through the week of Nov. 3. 
Franklin had raised $893,914 and booked $573,599 in ads for the same period. VPAP also ranks Franklin among the top five Democratic House fundraisers as of the Aug. 31 reporting period. 
 Lily Franklin

A former teacher and legislative aide who grew up in a five-generation Southwest Virginia family, Franklin, 31, pitches herself as the candidate most closely tied to the district’s daily realities. 
“I’ve had lived experiences that are very similar to folks in this district. … I worked multiple jobs to make ends meet,” she said in a recent phone interview, adding that having lived paycheck to paycheck shapes how she approaches policy. Her campaign biography highlights work for Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, and a political science degree from Longwood University.
After losing by fewer than 200 votes in 2023, Franklin said her operation this cycle started earlier and is broader. 
“We’ve been talking to folks on the ground and knocking on doors since April. We have been connecting with students on campus all year round,” she said. What’s different, in her view, is an electorate “ready for new leadership and a change,” and a campaign that offers a future “we’re fighting for, not just voting against another candidate.”
Franklin’s read on the district is pointedly non-ideological. “People want their elected officials to deliver on everyday solutions, they just want their lives to be less chaotic. … ‘I just need my electric bill to be 20% less.’” 
That message is calibrated for a district she says is among the youngest in the state — with a median age of 29 — but also includes rural and suburban neighborhoods. 
“I connect deeply on the community values that unite us,” she said, adding that she’s felt the region’s housing crunch personally after being priced out of Blacksburg into Christiansburg.
On housing, Franklin backs a mix of renter relief and ownership incentives — a state tax credit for renters spending more than 30% of income on housing, stronger legal protections against unjust evictions, and public-private partnerships to help first-time buyers. 
She also favors curbing large-scale investor purchases.
“We should be banning hedge funds from buying out our homes and really trying to incentivize people who live here locally to take a little bit more ownership,” Franklin said. That position tracks with a growing debate in Richmond over investor activity in tight markets such as Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech enrollment has strained supply.
Transportation is another pillar of the Democrat’s campaign. 
Franklin said much of the Interstate 81 work through the New River and Roanoke valleys is underway and should be “wrapped up” as planned. She supports the Christiansburg Amtrak station as an economic catalyst and doesn’t approve of adding tolls, arguing Virginia should prioritize existing surplus dollars before new fees. 
Franklin’s economic blueprint leans on translating Virginia Tech’s research strength into local jobs: targeted incentives for firms that spin out of campus, stronger workforce training and a caution that budget cuts can reverberate through already fragile regional employers. 
On data centers, she favors local control over siting, with regional coordination on shared resources like the electric grid — a question Montgomery County leaders have pressed in recent months. 
On public education, Franklin argues Virginia’s funding formula is outdated and should be refocused on student needs. She supports raising teacher pay and incentives for hard-to-staff divisions and says the state’s surplus shows Virginia has a “priorities” problem, not a revenue problem.
Franklin draws a sharp contrast on reproductive rights, pledging to vote for the constitutional amendment to protect reproductive freedom, including access to contraception and IVF. She links the policy to access challenges on the ground, noting a “year-long wait list to see an OBGYN” in Montgomery County. The proposed amendment is expected to go before voters after clearing two successive General Assembly sessions.
On guns, Franklin frames her position as “Second Amendment, with safeguards,” backing safe-storage standards, background checks and restrictions for domestic-violence offenders — measures that have polled well in a range of Virginia communities.
Franklin also made campaign-finance reform part of her closing argument, promising an opening-day bill to ban donations from public service corporations and to create a faster, state-backed disaster-relief/resilience fund after storms — citing long waits for federal help after Hurricane Helene. 
Her bottom line: With Democrats favored to gain ground this year, HD-41 should send a member “within the majority party” who knows “how to pass legislation and get money back to the district.”
 Chris Obenshain

Obenshain, 47, counters with a record-and-relationships pitch. A Montgomery County prosecutor and Army Reserve officer who grew up in Roanoke County, he won the open seat in 2023 and says constituent service and concrete wins define his first term. His campaign biography cites stints in local, state and federal roles and deep family ties in the region.
In a phone interview with The Mercury, the Republican pointed first to passenger rail as one of his most significant accomplishments during his first term. 
“Getting passenger rail back to the New River Valley for the first time in decades” — with trains slated to roll into Christiansburg “very soon” — was a top promise, he said, crediting coordination across “local, state, (and) federal” partners. 
Obenshain called his locality a “very balanced … competitive district” and said that’s why “an experienced and effective voice” matters. Day to day, he said, the job is listening and solving problems — from unemployment benefits to paving requests — and coming prepared when session moves fast.
On housing, Obenshain said the state’s role is to speed supply by reducing “excess mandates and regulations that drive up the cost of housing,” and to help localities move projects “through the pipeline” faster because “time is money.” 
He also supports “guardrails” on large outside investors who buy and hold local homes, arguing the state should ensure first responders and new graduates can afford to live where they work.
I-81 remains his marquee infrastructure focus. Obenshain emphasized that he helped secure an extra $70 million in the budget to accelerate projects and wants to prioritize widening the backup-plagued stretch between Christiansburg and Salem, with expanded passenger rail also relieving pressure. He favors continuing to steer surplus dollars into the corridor rather than relying on tolls or new revenue until current plans are funded.
Obenshain leans heavily into workforce development to tie Virginia Tech innovation to jobs — expanding apprenticeships and career and technical education, with earlier exposure in K-12. 
He praised a new Career and Technical Education Center in Roanoke and growing offerings in Montgomery County, adding that community colleges are vital “to meet the jobs of the future.”
Like Franklin, he said data center siting should be a local decision, with regional collaboration on water and electricity but “no state veto from another part of Virginia.” On education policy, he backs “parents’ rights” and education savings accounts to broaden school choice, while emphasizing that “it’s always a team effort” with teachers.
On abortion, he opposes the constitutional amendment, arguing it would “overturn decades of existing law, require taxpayers to fund even elective abortions up to 40 weeks” and undo parental-consent rules — claims Democrats dispute. 
But he also renewed his support of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother and said voters should scrutinize what the amendment would actually do. 
On gun policy, Obenshain said enforcement should target violent offenders and repeat gun crimes, not “law-abiding gun owners,” noting Democrats didn’t docket his bill to increase penalties for using a firearm in a violent felony. 
Environmental stewardship, he said, is about enforcing existing laws to protect places like the New River, McAfee Knob and the Appalachian Trail.
Obenshain touted two bipartisan proposals as examples for his willingness to work with lawmakers from across the aisle: He backed a regulated retail cannabis market, where he said public-safety concerns unite both parties, and anti-Semitic threat legislation he introduced that a Democrat carried and the governor signed.
His closing argument centers on continuity. “I’ve been an effective voice for Southwest Virginia, reducing costs on energy, healthcare and housing, fighting costly mandates, and investing in public education and public safety. … I hope people see the progress that’s being made and my passion for continuing that work.”

(Photo by Evan Visconti/Virginia Mercury) Approximately 60% of Virginia is located inside the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and those communities now have access to an updated map that shows precisely how their landscapes are changing over time. 
The Chesapeake Bay Program’s land use and land cover change mapping project compares the landscape across three different snapshots in time, offering a detailed view of the watershed up to as recently as 2021. 
The research shows Virginia has lost nearly 50,000 acres of tree canopy in its portion of the watershed to development over just seven years. 
The publically-available mapping project “empowers people with information that they can use to make longer term and more sustainable land-use decisions,” said Peter Claggett, research geographer with the U.S. Geological Survey and lead for the Chesapeake Bay Program land data team. 
“Overall, it enables you, down to a community level, to identify opportunities for restoration and conservation and for everyone to gain a perspective about how their community is changing over time,” Claggett said. 
The most significant change to the landscape between 2014 and 2021 that researchers hope to highlight with the data was a rapid loss of tree canopy and forests due to human development. 
Tree cover status and change fact sheets were created as part of the project to provide  county or municipality-level analysis of tree canopy and a summary of the local benefits those trees provide. 
Experts quantified several of the benefits trees provide with a tool called iTree Landscape, which estimates how much air pollution, stormwater runoff and carbon are removed from the environment by the trees in communities. 
The estimates provide a more concrete way for people to understand what tree canopy is worth, because “talking about acres of tree canopy between time periods is a little abstract in some ways,” said Elliott Kurtz, geospatial data engineer for the Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center, a contributor to the mapping project.
The iTree estimates show that “we’re not just doing this to protect the trees for the trees’ own sake; this is also providing real benefits to people in the community,” said Kurtz. 
In addition to the watershed-wide mapping project, the Virginia Department of Forestry (DOF) is currently working on creating its own map as part of a 2024 General Assembly bill that requires the agency to create a “Forestland and Urban Tree Canopy Conservation Plan” for the entire state by November 2026. 
The statewide data mapping project will compare how the landscape has changed between 2018 and 2023 through the use of aerial imagery and DOF’s “boots on the ground” knowledge of every timber harvest operation in the Commonwealth, Johnson said. 
This will ideally provide an even more accurate look at how Virginia’s landscape is changing, and identify precisely which tree canopy losses are temporary as a result of rotational timber harvests and which are permanent as a result of development. 
“The concern from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation is that when the land use changes completely to something other than forest, pasture or agriculture, then you lose the infiltration ability of the land,” said Ann Jurczyk, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Virginia manager of urban restoration. 
“Generally, that’s when you have increased storm water runoff and increased heat and the other things that are detrimental to both the people and the critters that live in the Bay,” Jurczyk said. 
Claggett said one of the major benefits of landscape mapping is that it allows communities to zoom in or out and ask, “‘are we on a trajectory that we want to continue, or are we headed to become a place that we don’t want to become?’”
 Emerging threats to tree canopy

The watershed as a whole lost just over 100,000 acres of tree cover to development over the seven-year course of the study so far, with nearly half of those losses occurring in Virginia, according to data from the project. 
Researchers also analyzed losses of what they termed forested extent. These are lands that not only contained tree canopy with an unmanaged, natural understory when the images were taken, but also lands that were in the early stages of regenerating back into natural forest after being logged prior to imaging. 
Taking these lands into account, data shows the watershed as a whole lost about 177,000 acres of forested extent to development, with Virginia contributing a loss of over 70,000 acres.

The research uncovered several emerging threats to tree canopy in Virginia, which include the construction of utility scale solar arrays, warehouses, road expansions and electrical transmission lines. 
Landscape changes like these are considered permanent, whereas harvesting land for timber and then allowing it to regenerate, an industry that statewide adds over $20 billion to Virginia’s economy annually, is viewed as a temporary change to tree canopy and the forest structure.
Virginia’s portion of the watershed is seeing more development as a result of its emerging land uses, “and it’s very much along these sort of growth corridors from D.C. southward to Richmond and then from Richmond east to Hampton Roads,” said Jurczyk. “We’re growing by leaps and bounds; Charlottesville, Staunton, Harrisonburg all lost tree canopy as well.”
The timing of the mapping project allowed researchers to capture “the initiation of utility scale solar in the region,” said Claggett. The growing source of energy has major implications on how communities are making use of their land, particularly in Virginia where 54% of all solar panels that the project mapped throughout the watershed were found.
Between 2014 and 2018, the project mapped just over 600 acres of solar panel arrays in the Commonwealth. Then between 2018 and 2021, that number jumped to over 3,200 acres of solar panel arrays mapped.
“Unlike other states, in Virginia for the first time period, 74% of (land containing solar arrays) came from forested extent, and the second time period saw 68% come from forested extent,” Claggett said.
These percentages signify yet another competing land use in Virginia’s forestlands.
“Ideally, we’d like to see solar on reclaimed mine lands, on rooftops, on landfills, on land that can’t be used for agriculture or forestry,” Claggett said.  
The biggest solar operations currently in Virginia were installed shortly after the 2021 mapping imagery was captured. Claggett said he expects the next round of imagery to pick up between roughly 10,000 to 15,000 more acres of solar arrays in Virginia. 
The next update to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s land cover mapping project will analyze imagery from 2025 and 2026. Researchers expect to publish that data before 2029.
 A closer look at our streams 

The project also released new high-resolution hydrography data, or mapping of how water moves throughout the landscape, to provide the most comprehensive inventory of the watershed’s stream and ditch network to date, according to researchers.
Without updated mapping, if streams are modified or buried over, then we “lose track of how the landscape drains,” said Matt Baker, professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 
The hydrography data has the ability to pick up tiny streams and channels that exist in the headwaters of large rivers that eventually drain into the Chesapeake Bay. 
“It’s quite important for us to know about them in our mapping efforts because they are conduits for both the water, nutrients and other pollutants that might move across the landscape,” said Baker. “So in the context of the Chesapeake Bay Program, it’s really important to understand where the water is flowing and what it might be carrying on its way to the Bay.”
Mapping waterways improves researchers’ understanding of where aquatic habitats may exist and what is restricting the natural movements and migration of different species.

Possible blockades such as culverts, the drainage pipes beneath roads and other infrastructure, can create a barrier to threatened migratory species such as river herring and American shad that depend on making it upstream to spawn.
Updated mapping also allows researchers to identify streams that are missing from existing maps but could be providing aquatic habitat.

“We’re finding this data shows a lot more streams that hold fish populations,” especially for species found in the colder headwater streams that the research homed in on, said Mike Evans, deputy director of the Chesapeake Conservancy Conservation Innovation Center. 
 Community tree planting efforts

Despite the significant loss of tree canopy and forested extent to development, communities throughout the watershed still managed to plant a historic number of trees. 
“I know there is some discussion of loss, but we also have hit record numbers of new trees in the ground,” said Lara Johnson, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s urban and community forestry program manager. 
In 2024, there were about 5,700 acres of community trees planted throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the highest total reported since tracking began in 2014, according to community tree planting data compiled by the Chesapeake Bay Program.
“We’re so proud of our partner Bay states and also all of our partners in Virginia,” said Johnson, highlighting several of the “grassroots” community planting programs that DOF supports.

The Virginia Trees for Clean Water Grant Program is available to communities looking to fund tree-planting efforts that raise public awareness of the benefits of trees and their impacts on water quality. The Throwing Shade VA Program provides a discount on native trees purchased from a Virginia nursery. 
“Both of those programs have planted more than 70,000 trees just last year in Virginia,”  Johnson said. 
Riparian buffers, a major contributor to the overall health of the Chesapeake Bay, are strips of forest that border waterways and act as a natural filter to remove pollutants from runoff before they enter a stream or river. 
The Riparian Forests for Landowners (RFFL) program is unique in that it “establishes buffers on landscapes that we probably wouldn’t typically be able to,” said Patti Nylander, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s watershed program coordinator. 
The program is open to small, private landowners, a demographic which normally misses out on riparian buffer funding that typically targets large agricultural lands. The program has already added 110 acres of riparian forest buffer in Virginia, said Nylander.
The James River Buffer Program is also making progress on riparian buffer planting. Since its launch in 2019, the collaboration has installed about 1,300 acres of riparian buffer, equal to over 400,000 native trees.

In addition to planting new trees, Jurczyk said communities need to “put more emphasis on preservation of existing tree canopy and less emphasis on what we replace.” 
“Part of that is just understanding at the locality level just how hamstrung we are on enforcing tree canopy replacement,” said Jurczyk. 
In Virginia, localities can only require that up to 10% of trees be replaced after removal for developing a commercial or industrial site and 20% or 30%, depending on the district, be replaced after removal for developing a residential site. 
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has argued year after year that the replacement percentage should be “a floor, not a ceiling” on the amount of trees that a locality can require to be replaced after removal for a development, said Jurczyk.
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, was chief patron of a bill in this year’s General Assembly session that would have given localities statewide the option to enforce higher tree canopy replacement percentages that are currently available only to Planning District 8 in Northeastern Virginia. 
After approval by both the House and Senate, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill.
“The current law on tree canopy ordinances strikes a balance between the ability of a locality to hinder residential and commercial development with increased costs and the ability of a locality to preserve tree canopy,” Youngkin wrote in his veto statement.

(Photo courtesy of Kenda Sutton-El/Birth in Color)Seven years ago, Congress’ Preventing Maternal Deaths Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump — but the funding it provides to states to address maternal health disparities is set to expire at the end of this month. This year, its renewal was left out of Trump’s budget proposal. 
While competing priorities are at play as Congress deliberates continuing resolutions to avoid a government shutdown by Oct. 1., the funding has bolstered data collection that informs policies to help prevent pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia and nationwide. 
Dubbed the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM, nearly $90 million has gone towards state committees around the country that review maternal deaths and analyze the causes. The committees’ findings have helped spur protocols aimed at preventing hemorrhage, sepsis or suicide. 
Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team, for instance, collects data and the Virginia Department of Health also posts a data dashboard.
The data collection is in line with a broader effort to address maternal health disparities and underlying causes in maternal mortality. Data shows that deaths have decreased in recent years while collected data has also informed state policies, such as Virginia’s “Momnibus” packages that were signed into law this year.  Those measures enabled Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives and pilot programs for remote monitoring for hypertension.
Not every proposal prevailed, such as a mutli-year effort to require unconscious bias training for license renewals — a measure to target one facet of why Black women are more likely to die in childbirth, but others have addressed support for maternal health workforces and Medicaid enrollment timelines for pregnant people. 
Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said lawmakers will reintroduce failed or vetoed legislation again next year. She’s particularly hopeful about the unconscious bias bill, as it has consistently had bipartisan patrons. She also hopes a bill that would support businesses providing childcare to workers can pass. 
“You can’t talk about moms without talking about babies,” she said. 
Though Youngkin and some Republicans have noted support for addressing maternal health disparities and improving outcomes, Democrats have largely led on the issue. In an interview with The Mercury, Mundon King took a moment to stump for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, who she believes will get the other Momnibus bills across the finish line. 
Be it Spanberger, or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, either woman will be responsible for signing off on the state’s next budget — one that will likely need to address several federal funding losses. 
Not extending the ERASE MM program in Trump’s budget plans is what U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, called part of a larger push to “shrink the federal government willy nilly.” 
Throughout the summer she has cautioned that federal funding cuts will put more burden on states, and said some states will forgo certain services altogether. 
“Rather than looking at what are the important problems to solve,” she said, the cuts have culminated in a lot of health care infrastructure taking hits or bracing for them.
McClellan and Democratic state lawmakers have said throughout the spring and the summer the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to negatively affect the public health landscape with its changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid. So far, three clinics have closed in Virginia — citing the act as part of the reason — while hospital administrators have spoken out as well. 
On maternal health specifically, McClellan said letting ERASE MM lapse essentially erases the good intentions Republicans in Congress and the president have espoused with regards to both maternal health and the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.  
She juxtaposed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. MAHA initiatives against the different federal funding cuts to public health like the OBBBA, the tax credits that help people purchase health insurance which have yet to be renewed, and funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health. 
“It’s just a huge disconnect that I don’t think they see,” she said. 
Previous efforts to extend the ERASE MM funding have been unsuccessful — like a stopgap funding measure in December 2024 that failed with Republican opposition. The program was also missing from Trump’s budget proposals for next year. Legislation to extend the program introduced this year has not advanced so far. As Congress stares down a potential government shutdown before Oct. 1, it may not be included yet again. 
With the 2026 fiscal year beginning on that date, Congress needs to have resolved its appropriations bills or agree on a continuing resolution in the interim. Such resolutions have become par for the course in recent years for the nation’s legislative body. 
If McClellan and other federal lawmakers can’t extend the program in its current form this year, she plans to “absolutely” work on reauthorization in the future. 
North Carolina Central University nursing department chair Yolanda VanRiel is also watching closely. As a nursing professor, she helps oversee the education of future health care workers. She noted how programs like ERASE MM are an example of federal funding that helps states across the country.
“Maternal health is one of the most urgent equity issues of our time,” she said. “We know that solutions like community-based programs, culturally responsive care (and) consistent monitoring works, but we need the will to sustain them.” 
North Carolina is among the states to have maternal health data dashboards that help inform policy and has also its own Momnibus package in the works, but it has not passed yet. 
“Momnibus (legislation) shows what is possible when states lead boldly, but states cannot do this alone,” VanRiel said. “Federal and state partnerships ground the belief that every mother’s life matters.”

In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers sought to build a new system with “rigorous standards” for students, “best-in-class assessments, and a transparent and meaningful accountability and support system,” according to a Jan. 9 report. 
The agency suggested in a statement to The Mercury that lawmakers could have avoided delays by including ”mandatory carry forward language” when appropriating  $500,000 for the project, which would have allowed officials to begin soliciting proposals from qualified vendors immediately. 
“No General Assembly deadlines have been missed, and the General Assembly has been steadily updated,” said Kenita Matthews, a VDOE spokeswoman, in a statement last week. 
The response came after Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor and chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Health, raised concerns about delays and risks in a letter to Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera and Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Guillickson.
In her Sept. 22 letter, Hashmi noted that no Request for Proposals (RFP) had been issued following the legislature’s authorization for the agency to extend the existing Standards of Learning assessment contract with Pearson, an educational publishing company, through Dec. 31, 2027. The intent was to ensure “continuity of testing” while a new contract is secured. 
Hashmi added that lawmakers appropriated $500,000 for VDOE to hire a vendor to analyze options for an innovative new assessment system and to craft a competitive RFP with input from a work group of superintendents, teachers, principals, and assessment experts.
Under the budget language, a report with cost options and recommendations is due to the House and Senate education and appropriations committees by Nov. 1.
Hashmi wrote that the education committees were told the RFP would be issued by Sept. 1, but that deadline was missed and monthly updates had not been submitted.  
Without a vendor and a project plan underway, she warned, the timeline for releasing an RFP next year “cannot be met.” 
“The absence of market analysis and cost estimates will force the 2026 General Assembly to appropriate funds for a new multi-year assessment contract without the benefit of informed estimates or competitive bids, risking either underfunding the program or committing tens of millions of dollars beyond what is necessary,” Hashmi wrote. “Inaction now jeopardizes both fiscal responsibility and the quality of assessments for our students. The stakes are significant.”
Matthews countered that because the budget did not allow the funds  to carry over from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, the agency needed approval before moving forward. She said there was not enough time to properly hire a consultant before June, when the governor approved VDOE’s expedited discretionary carryover request on Aug. 25.
Typically, the governor must approve leftover funding for the following year in the fall, Matthews said.
“To ensure compliance with procurement policies and procedures the department had to ensure that the carryover request was approved, and carryover funding was allotted prior to posting an RFP and approved funding/appropriation was available to support the awarding of a contract to an assessment consultant,” she wrote.
Matthews said VDOE is now finalizing the procurement process for the mandated assessment vendor and expects to issue the RFP no later than October 6.
She added that VDOE will resume providing monthly updates to lawmakers. The work group also has six meetings scheduled before the end of the year, two of them ahead of the Nov. 1 reporting deadline.
Hashmi received a response letter from Gullickson, which she is currently reviewing.

“This is a substantial undertaking by the commonwealth that will impact our school districts, educators, and students for years to come, and we have a condensed time frame to act,” Hashmi said in a statement to the Mercury. “It is time to get serious with the Request for Proposal (RFP) process, continue a transparent process with stakeholders, and ensure our students are well-positioned for success in 2026.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Construction of Revolution Wind has been allowed to resume by a court, at least for now. But federal funding for renewables remains uncertain, perhaps signaling more trouble ahead for large infrastructure projects. What is the path forward to ensure Rhode Island, and New England more broadly, stay on track with the energy transition despite federal backtracking?
An energy transition away from fossil fuels must prioritize policy mixes that invest heavily in distributed and local mechanisms for energy production, such as rooftop and community solar, and give the state greater influence in the decision-making process. A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.
The relative success of solar photovoltaic (PV) incentive policies in Connecticut and New York shows that households at all income levels have started adopting solar though gaps persist in low-income neighborhoods. Such programs make solar a reliable and affordable tool for decarbonizing energy production and a way to deliver significant savings for households.
Rhode Island had at least 65 large-scale solar PV projects with nearly 400 MW of capacity by late 2024, potentially generating enough electricity to match the annual consumption of 50,000 to 80,000 households, with additional projects continuing to come online. Among the newest is the Exeter Mail Solar Field, the largest of three facilities commissioned by a collaboration of the state’s public housing authorities to offset their costs and reduce their energy bills.
The Exeter Mail project, dedicated on Sept. 12, would fit the definition of community solar, which are shared solar farms that let multiple households access solar power even if they can’t install panels on their own property. Participants receive cheaper electricity, reducing their overall energy costs. These projects are particularly valuable because not all households have suitable rooftops or the means to cover upfront installation costs. 
But there were only seven other community solar projects as of 2024, with most located around Providence and Bristol. These projects show that there is enough appetite for such infrastructure projects in Rhode Island. For example, neighboring Connecticut has 69 large-scale projects but with a combined capacity of only 300 MW. Despite these positive trends, there is a clear gap between the benefits provided by renewables and large-scale adoption. 










A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.


A study from NREL highlighted that Rhode Island has an upper-bound technical electricity generation potential of more than 3 million MWh from rooftop solar, out of which 1.3 million MWh are in low and medium-income areas alone. That would cover a large portion of electricity consumption in the state. However, technical potential doesn’t fully translate into real capacity due to economic, political and social factors. To get close to even a fraction of this capacity, governments need to emphasize robust pre- and post-purchase incentive programs that make households willing to adopt.
Evidence from California, where a policy reducing payments for excess electricity was established in 2022, before being recently overturned, shows how quickly solar markets can collapse if policy signals change. Similarly, the cancellation of Revolution Wind created uncertainty, and the state must step up to provide stability. For solar, the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which has lowered the costs of systems by 30% is due to end early at the end of this year, leaving a gap in the incentive structure for this technology.
Despite this uncertainty, one thing is clear: renewable energy projects can reduce the cost for the end consumer by stabilizing electricity prices, making it a winning message for policymakers. This is especially the case in Rhode Island as electricity prices for residential consumers have increased 65% since 2010, with transmission costs making up a great deal of the bill. One of the most consequential behavioral modifiers for households is rising prices. Reports have linked high electricity costs to fossil fuel production, a hotly debated issue and a significant burden for many households. The volatility in the price of natural gas and Rhode Island’s heavy reliance on it to power the grid is a recipe for continued uncertainty in electricity markets.
Policymakers in the local government need to see local renewable projects as a way to ensure energy independence and accelerate investment in them in the short term. The focus needs to be on making it attractive for communities to adopt renewables. Solar, especially, has become an economical way of producing electricity and with increasing capacity comes the benefit of lowering emissions for a sector that accounts for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions.
After all, everybody loves cheap, guilt-free electricity.

Kaleidoscope Youth Center’s Housing Program is closing after a grant supporting it was not renewed by the Ohio Department of Health.

ODH’s Services for Homeless Youth and Homeless Pregnant Youth Grant operates on a two-year cycle, with the previous cycle ending June 30. The department gave Kaleidoscope $227,247 ($113,623 per year) in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. 
“This grant has been a significant source of funding for our housing program since 2021,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. “Notably, this information was received approximately 45 days past the start date of July 1st, and we are now left with a pending deficit and the need to quickly relocate 10 young people without resources.” 
ODH received 18 applications for funding for the 2025-26 cycle and had $2.2 million to be awarded, ODH spokesperson Ken Gordon said. 
“Kaleidoscope Youth Center’s application was scored, and based on its low score compared to other applicants, the center was not one of the 15 applicants that were awarded the limited amount of funds available in the current grant cycle,” he said in an email. 
Kaleidoscope scored 120 out of 205 points, according to Gordon. 
“The executive summary section includes information about the target audience for the project, but without local data, it makes it difficult to understand why this population was picked,” ODH wrote in an Aug. 19 letter to Kaleidoscope. “… Overall, this application was missing important key requirements throughout the narrative, making it difficult to understand how each deliverable would be carried out.”
Kaleidoscope is able to re-apply for the next grant cycle, which starts July 1, 2027. 
KYC housing program  
Kaleidoscope, which serves LGBTQ+ youth ages 12-24, started the housing program in 2019 and informed current participants in the program about the closure on Sept. 8, Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
“Although we do not have a current date by which they will need to move, the soonest would be early to mid-November,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
Kaleidoscope’s goal is to maintain the housing program through July 2026 when the final lease ends. 
“This would provide the resources and time to safely and humanely transition current participants while decreasing the threat of returning to homelessness,” according to the statement. “Our youth are scared, and so are we. It is not okay that they are facing the threat of returning to homelessness.” 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine used his veto power to nix a provision in the state’s two-year budget that would have prohibited giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
Nearly a quarter of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives, according to a 2022 report by the Trevor Project. Those who experiences homelessness or housing instability were also two to four times more likely to report depression, anxiety and self-harm, along with considering or attempting suicide, the report found.
LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than non-LGBTQ youth, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A transplant from Miami, Anallive Calle learned her way around Kansas City from behind the wheel of a big yellow school bus.
The tablet near the dash provides turn-by-turn directions to every stop and checks each kid on and off the bus throughout her route. It’s helped her navigate the narrow roads and one-ways that stretch through one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods.
And from her phone, she can check on the status of her own son and whether he made the bus each morning and afternoon.
“So it’s transparent all the way,” she said. “You know when your child is picked up and where they’re at every moment.”
Last school year, Kansas City Public Schools started a new transportation contract with Zum, a company that provides busing services for districts across the country.
With the new vendor, drivers welcomed updates like air conditioning and tinted windows that keep the new fleet comfortable. But they also were given a suite of new technology — a main driver of the 15,000-student urban school district’s decision to ink a $100 million, 5-year contract with Zum.
Aside from navigation, the buses are loaded with live cameras inside and out. Checking in at the tablet allows parents to track their kids and schools to get a headcount on that day’s breakfast and lunch. From the bus barn’s dispatch office, a large screen shows the location of each bus, its exact speed, whether it’s running on time — and even the driver’s rating from parents.
Derrick Gines, a Zum driver and safety trainer with 10 years of experience, said the technology built into today’s buses make drivers and students safer.
“Versus yesteryear, they were designed for freight — human freight,” he said. “But now, there’s so much safety wrapped around this thing.”
While the iconic yellow buses might look like those of yore, school systems big and small are increasingly investing in a new wave of on-board technology.
New software programs monitor engine components, alerting transportation departments to maintenance needs. Other tools create the most optimal routes, saving on fuel, staff and bus costs. Turn-by-turn navigation and student manifests help ensure that no driver is lost and no kid is left behind. And live video feeds can help with student behavior issues — even allowing a school principal to speak to students on the bus in real time, in some cases.
This newfangled technology is a stark contrast to the machinery and aesthetics of the yellow bus, which have remained largely unchanged for decades, said Ryan Gray, editor-in-chief of School Transportation News, which covers the industry.
“Even when you walk onto a school bus, it still looks the same,” he said. “But the inner workings have just completely changed. All of the advanced electronics in it — the wiring to make all of this technology work, whether it be the hardware or the software — it’s grown by leaps and bounds.”
More states guarantee students the right to school-day religious instruction off campus

Schools see some of these technologies as intuitive progress: Technology has reshaped many other facets of public education, while many bus drivers were stuck with paper maps and CB radios. But with the rise of new technology comes new risks, and some advocates are cautious about the security of all the data flowing through yellow buses.
A booming market of vendors and limited regulations on bus tech has given more responsibility to school IT and transportation departments. But Gray said most school districts are embracing these new tools — if they can afford them.
“It always comes down to money,” he said. “I think that if they think they have the money, they’re going to want to buy this stuff.
School systems and tech companies say these tools can improve student safety, create efficiencies and help alleviate the chronic shortage of bus drivers.
“It’s a huge recruiting tool,” said Jason Salmons, transportation director for Bentonville Schools in northwest Arkansas.
Bentonville contracts with Transportant, a Kansas-based company, to equip its buses with new camera and tracking technology. Salmons said the navigation and student tracking provide peace of mind to drivers, who can easily traverse new neighborhoods. The seven live cameras on each bus also provide security if an incident arises.
About 13,000 of the district’s 20,000 students ride buses across 135 daily routes. In addition to an upfront cost, he said the school system pays a subscription of about $90,000 per year.
The software tracks not only every bus, but also every student’s boarding and disembarkment, even taking photos of the kids. If something happens, law enforcement can see where a child was and what they were wearing at dropoff — providing a “priceless” service, Salmons said.
With real-time tracking — much like a rideshare customer would see on their screen — parents and students view buses as more reliable, he said. With more precise pickup times, students don’t wait outside in the cold as long and older kids can even get a few more minutes of sleep, Salmons said.
“High schoolers use the app as their bible,” he said.
Data privacy
Given the national driver shortage and parents’ focus on reliability, Cassie Creswell understands the appeal of the new bus technology. But she has concerns about the growing loads of data being collected.
“It’s a mixed bag on this stuff,” said Creswell, the co-chair of the national Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, which advocates to protect student data.
That group has pushed to keep cameras out of classrooms, but hasn’t taken a formal position on school buses, she said. Creswell, a parent of a Chicago Public Schools student, said the more data that is collected — such as GPS locations and video footage — the more opportunities for that data to be sold or illicitly breached.
“Are we actually clearing away stuff that you really shouldn’t hold on to forever?” she asked. “We’re so careless with student data — even very sensitive data — and we’re very careless about the long-term protection of that data.”
More than half the states have issued AI guidance for schools

School systems interviewed by Stateline said their bus data is being securely stored separately from other student records and that data such as videos are routinely deleted.
Alan Fairless, a founder and chief technology officer of the tech provider Transportant, previously worked in building encrypted tech products.
He said the company doesn’t sell any student data and encrypts the memory of each device — so, someone stealing a tablet off a bus would have no access to its memory. The company was created in 2018 to tackle parent and school concerns about bus reliability and delays.
Fairless said he quickly learned many districts struggle with high driver turnover because of student behavior issues on board.
By providing multiple cameras that can be accessed live, he said, the company’s product provides a new layer of support to drivers.
“Now, when something happens, they push a button and a dispatcher or principal is going to watch that bus in real time,” he said.
Fairless said one school district has what it calls a seven-minute rule: When a driver alerts of an incident, a dispatcher aims to watch the video, figure out what happened and notify parents over text or phone call within seven minutes.
“The effect is, that video arrives to the parents, and now they know the real problem, and they know that before the student comes home and creates some other version of the story,” he said. “So now, it’s like the parents and the school district are working together to solve the problem.”

Since launching, the company has contracted with 88 school systems in 19 states to provide its all-inclusive tech suite that includes the app for families, on-board Wi-Fi, camera systems and routing services.
While prices can vary, school districts typically pay about $3,600 per bus up front and an annual subscription cost of about $69 per bus, said Jeff Shackelford, vice president of sales.
Changing parent demands
The addition of Transportant has helped keep parents informed in Oregon’s Estacada School District, which sprawls across 750 square miles southeast of Portland.
“It’s been great customer service for our families to just see, just like when someone orders an Uber, they can keep track of where their kid is at,” said Maggie Kelly, a spokesperson for the school system of about 2,000 students.
Kelly said the district expects to make up some of its initial investment in the technology as it realizes savings from more efficient bus routes.
Parents are demanding more real-time information on bus times and locations, said Rick D’Errico, a spokesperson for Transfinder, whose products build more efficient bus routes and provide tracking apps for parents.
“If I can track a burrito order, why can’t I track a bus?” D’Errico said. “Parents these days expect their districts to have ways to notify them on individualized ETAs and alerts for when their kid is on their routes, and not rely on schoolwide email blasts.”
Recently, school districts in Alaska, Texas and Wyoming have launched the company’s apps, which are free for parents.
Such services can provide savings by cutting back on the number of drivers and buses in operation. But they also relieve pressure on dispatchers, who can be besieged with parent phone calls during disruptions or delays.
Since rolling out a new bus tracking app this year, the St. Johns County School District in northeast Florida has fielded far fewer parent calls.
That app is just the latest addition to a portfolio of advanced onboard technology, said Jonah Paxton, transportation fleet technology foreman at the district, which serves about 27,000 bus riders.
The 52,000-student school system intentionally purchased separate products for bus cameras, parent tracking and driver navigation. Paxton said that allows the school system to avoid getting stuck with a single provider that could demand higher prices in the future.
“We’re not locked into a single sort of a walled-garden of products, which gives us a lot more freedom to pick and choose which products we like, which ones we don’t like, and gives us a little more negotiating power,” he said.
To ensure security, the school system stores video files on its own servers rather than those of outside vendors, he said. The district has a specific video retention policy and it blurs out student faces if videos are ever requested under the state’s public records law.
Paxton said student and driver safety drives many of the tech decisions for the school’s fleet of more than 300 buses.
“Buses are vastly different than they were even five,10 years ago,” he said. “I think many people who haven’t ridden a bus in a while can think of the bus as sort of an unpleasant place, or kind of the Wild West of schooling, but they’ve really come a long way.”

Because PFAS contamination is pervasive in the surrounding area, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services has advised that soils cannot be removed from the region unless they are taken to a specialized facility. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the greater Merrimack area, where toxic forever chemicals are concentrated throughout the soil and a long-term cleanup plan is yet to materialize, keeping the contamination local is the best many feel they can do for now. But how well that’s working isn’t clear and guidance is scarce, creating headaches for developers and concern for activists.
“Soil is a major concern,” said Rep. Rosemarie Rung, of Merrimack. “There are no clear and distinct regulations on how to manage soil that needs to be removed.”
The prevalence of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, also called PFAS, in the Merrimack region is tied to the now-shuttered Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services contends that the facility released PFAS into the atmosphere in the course of its operations; the factory opened under different ownership in 1986, ended operations in May 2024, and was demolished earlier this year. 
Airborne PFAS settle into soils, from where the chemicals seep into water bodies and groundwater. In 2016, water testing revealed hundreds of contaminated wells in multiple towns. PFAS are extremely slow to break down in the environment and have been tied to myriad health concerns, including elevated incidences of certain cancers and other illnesses.
Saint-Gobain has paid for some short- and long-term drinking water solutions, including providing bottled water to some households, connecting others to public water, and filtering some public wells affected by the contaminants. 
When it comes to longer-term questions about how the soil contamination will be managed or cleaned up, however, the company, residents, and NHDES have struggled to reach an agreement, and New Hampshire has not yet settled on a remediation plan outlining Saint-Gobain’s cleanup responsibilities.
For soil contamination tied to Saint-Gobain emissions, NHDES considers the company responsible for any remediation that must occur, Waste Management Division Director Michael Wimsatt said. 
Saint-Gobain initially suggested “natural attenuation and institutional controls” as a management strategy for the contaminated area into the future, and the company continues to believe that strategy — involving monitoring levels over time as the chemicals dissipate into the environment — is an “appropriate remedy,” said company spokesperson Suzanne Loranc. 
However, NHDES disagreed and has sent a letter to the company requesting that Saint-Gobain investigate the soils in the area to understand more about the extent and nature of the contamination, spokesperson James Martin said in an email. The findings will inform longer-term action plans for both the Saint-Gobain site and broader area, Wimsatt said.
Loranc said Saint-Gobain anticipated conducting the preliminary investigation this fall. 
This will be followed by an initial report, then a next draft of an action plan, though this process could take months, Wimsatt said at the commission meeting.
Containment
In the meantime, life goes on in the Merrimack area — with added considerations for the proper care and containment of contaminated soil.
NHDES calls for PFAS-contaminated soil to be “managed appropriately to ensure it is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment,” Martin said.
That doesn’t explicitly mean that the soil cannot be removed from the area, Martin said. But there are limited options for what safe management of PFAS-contaminated soils could actually look like beyond containment, said Rep. Wendy Thomas, of Merrimack.
This is due, in part, to the sheer size of the area believed to be affected by PFAS pollution from Saint-Gobain.
“The Saint-Gobain site is a tremendously unique site,” Wimsatt said, larger than the other PFAS-contaminated sites NHDES encounters — meaning that traditional management guidance is not necessarily applicable. “The problem is that there are millions of cubic yards of soil. … It’s just not feasible, either technically or practically or economically, in any way feasible, to think that we’re going to pick up all those soils and bring them to a landfill somewhere, right?”
PFAS-contaminated soil can’t be placed just anywhere, and the dedicated hazardous waste landfills where it can be placed can also be costly. Other routes, like burning or heat-treating soil, are similarly difficult to implement, Thomas said. For now, strategies for managing soils center on keeping them in place — though, as Wimsatt noted, this strategy does not address the risk to groundwater from contaminated soils.
Unexpected costs
A common circumstance that might call for relocating significant volumes of soil is construction — and development is still progressing in Merrimack, where Saint-Gobain’s legacy “hasn’t really scared anybody away,” according to community development director Robert Price. But it has created the need for additional considerations, and sometimes costs, that not everybody expects, he said. 
“Developers, they’ve obviously heard of the Saint-Gobain contamination issue and all of that, but they aren’t necessarily aware fully of how it affects them,” Price said. “… So they realize later in the process, like, oh, by the way, you’re not allowed to remove soil from the property. And so they have to figure out, OK – what do we do with all this now?”
The town faces the same challenges.
Initial plans for a bridge construction project called for the town to relocate about 9,000 cubic yards of soil, Merrimack Town Manager Paul Micali said. But taking that soil to a dedicated facility is expensive, and it was unclear whether Saint-Gobain or any other entity would help pay for it.
“We are trying to come up with a plan to figure out what we can and cannot do with the soil,” Micali said Sept. 22. He’s concerned, he said, that the uncertainty will delay the project, which the town had hoped to put out to bid in the fall. 
Ultimately, according to Martin, plans were updated to keep all the soil contained on site, using the excess to construct berms and slopes. This path is similar to that taken by other developers who have struggled to determine what to do with their excess soil, Price said. Not all have found a path forward — leading to piles of dirt popping up from time to time along Daniel Webster Highway.
“There are a lot of projects up and down (Daniel Webster) highway that are affected by it,” Micali said. “All these projects are being affected … They can’t remove the contaminated soil.”
Unclear scope
Another challenge is establishing a border around the affected area. A commonly referenced zone is the boundary laid out in a 2018 consent decree between NHDES and Saint-Gobain, which includes portions of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry, Manchester, and Merrimack. But the zone is a legal boundary and does not fully encompass the extent of pollution from Saint-Gobain, Martin said. 
Contaminated water supplies and illnesses associated with PFAS exposure have been found outside the boundaries of the agreement, Thomas said. And because PFAS leach into groundwater through the soil, activists such as Laurene Allen of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water have said they find inaction, and the attenuation strategy proposed by Saint-Gobain, unacceptable.
“The contamination levels have not dropped over the years of site data and are not expected to drop as these are chemicals that will only decrease if the site is remediated,” Allen said. Citing the water filtration some residents were undertaking at their own expense, air quality concerns, and danger to those working in the area, she added that she felt the site should have been designated a federal CERCLA, or superfund, site, to put the authority to push for a remedy onto the federal government.
“DES lacks the authority to order action. The solutions are there for soil removal and management as well as groundwater remediation but it seems (New Hampshire) does not have the will to set a state policy of polluter accountability,” she said. “This site continues to add to our aquifer contamination that we are filtering at our own expense. … It’s a long overdue issue of environmental justice and we are paying for what we did not cause with not only remediation but also with (our) health.”
Wimsatt said NHDES believed holding Saint-Gobain directly responsible for cleanup was a more efficient way to proceed than going through Superfund. 
“What we always do is we look for a responsible party that has both the wherewithal and the willingness to do the work they need to do, and in virtually any case, we see that as a much more efficient way to get people protected than going through the Superfund process,” he said, pointing to Saint-Gobain’s work to remedy residents’ drinking water as an example of forward progress.
However, some advocates said they weren’t yet satisfied. 
“We’ve had to assume so much cost, headache, personal loss because of the actions of Saint-Gobain,” Rung said. “… We need to tighten up the regulations and the responsibility.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/saintgobain-soil-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death in northeast Louisiana is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track make clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels…to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at CMS during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners. “Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states, including Rhode Island, declared bankruptcy in January. “I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. MPT bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with MPT and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give CMS an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.










There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’


– Erin Fuse Brown, professor, Brown University School Public Health


A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said CMS uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to CMS about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at CMS’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms, and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a CMS spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health-care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did. Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging that Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of CMS to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

CMS is not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from Medicare and Medicaid. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of Glenwood with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

Even as the number of youths who identify as LGBTQ rises, so has the number of state-level bills seeking to curtail their rights, a new analysis finds.
The number of bills aimed at rolling back or prohibiting in-school protections and health care access has tripled from 77 in 2020 to some 300 a year in 2023, 2024 and 2025, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
The drumbeat of legislation, report the researchers, has taken a steep toll on the mental health of the students in the crosshairs — regardless of where they live. When the dramatic escalation in legislation started in 2023, 90% of LGBTQ people ages 13 to 24 said politics had a negative impact on their well-being — up from 71% in 2022.
Policies enabling in-school support are particularly important to LGBTQ youth. Slightly more than half say they are accepted by peers or teachers at school, compared with 40% who are supported at home. The presence of even one supportive educator in a child’s life has long been shown to reduce rates of suicidality, anxiety and depression.
The number of young people impacted has risen sharply in recent years, though estimates vary depending on how data is tabulated. According to a recent Gallup survey, almost 2 million — or 9.5% — of teens ages 13 to 17 now identify as something other than straight or cisgender. That’s nearly twice as many as in 2020.
The project tracks state LGBTQ and elections policies using interactive maps featuring detailed information that is continually updated. For the new report, researchers tallied the number of states that enacted one or more of 16 types of laws commonly proposed in statehouses since 2020 — nine restrictive and seven protective — throughout the country.
They then combined that information with demographic data and surveys of LGBTQ young people’s well-being from a number of advocacy organizations. The top takeaway: Whether a student attends a school where teachers are able to talk about LGBTQ history, enforce anti-harassment rules, maintain confidences about a child’s identity and allow gender-nonconforming youth to play sports depends on where they live.
Nearly half of queer youth live in one of 27 states that have enacted one or more restrictions on their rights, ranging from bathroom bans to laws prohibiting schools from enacting anti-bullying policies. Thirty-eight percent live in the South, 24% in the West, 21% in the Midwest and 17% in the Northeast.
Of the nine negative state laws the researchers looked at, seven involve schools. The other two are bans on medical care for transgender youth and laws exempting providers of child welfare services, such as foster care, from nondiscrimination rules on religious grounds.



Tennessee has adopted eight, Arkansas, Montana and Idaho enacted seven each, and six other states imposed six or more new restrictions. Three-fourths of Southern states and two-thirds of the Midwest ban trans youth sports participation and medical care, while a third or fewer do in the West and Northeast.
While several states have adopted new, protective laws since 2020, MAP estimates that 6 in 10 LGBTQ youth live in places where there is no legal guarantee of support.
In 2023, 2 in 5 LGBTQ young people and their families said they had considered moving because of politics in their home state. Just 4% actually had — but if that rate is an accurate reflection of all affected families, at least 266,000 people have likely relocated, the researchers estimate.

Survey: More Than Half of LGBTQ Florida Parents Are Thinking About Moving

 




According to a survey released earlier this year by The Trevor Project, 25% of cisgender queer youth and their families and 45% of trans families have considered moving to a state with more protective laws. Seven in 10 families with a transgender member living in states with restrictive laws have thought about relocating, while 12% have crossed state lines for medical care.
Along with its state policy tally, the project released a second paper summarizing information gathered by half a dozen LGBTQ advocacy groups about the impact the recent political climate has had on queer young people. The data echoes the 2023 findings of a 74 investigation that found harassment, victimization and discrimination have spiked in blue states as well as red.



Recent surveys by The Trevor Project and GLSEN, which advocate for protective school policies, found there is no state where fewer than 93% of LGBTQ students reported hearing slurs in school in 2023. Nationwide, 83% were harassed, 54% were sexually harassed and more than 12% assaulted.
Research has long established that a hostile school climate translates to absenteeism, lower grade-point averages and graduation rates, and dramatically higher discipline rates, depression and stress — all of which can impact a student’s life trajectory.

Data Show LGBTQ Students Report Bullying and Attacks from Kids — and Teachers

 




The number of young people impacted has swelled, a change the report attributes in part to generational shifts. While 3% of Baby Boomers and 5% of Gen X identify as LGBTQ, a 2025 Gallup survey found the rate is 14% among Millennials and 23% for Gen Z.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the number of high school students ages 13 to 17 who identify as LGBTQ rose from 11% in 2015 to 26% in 2023.
Some of the sharp increase can be attributed to changes in how data is collected and categorized; to people realizing at younger ages they are not straight or cisgender; and to internet access to queer communities. But much of the rise can be attributed to the number of young people who identify as bisexual and/or nonbinary.
The number of transgender people of all ages, for example, has hovered around half a percent for the last decade, according to the University of California, Los Angeles’ Williams Institute. Meanwhile, Gallup found 59% of LGBTQ people in Gen Z, defined as those born between 1997 and 2006, are bisexual, and 76% of nonbinary adults are under age 29.

(Getty Images)As psychiatrists, we care daily for Granite Staters living with mental illness, addiction, developmental disorders, cognitive disorders, and the complicated medical conditions that often accompany them. We see firsthand how the decisions, or indecisions, of our public health leadership at the national level shape the lives of our patients and families. That is why we are deeply concerned about threats to clear, science-based information resulting from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other public health leaders. 
Medication safety and misinformation
Depression and other mental illnesses are some of the most disabling conditions in the United States. Safe, effective medications, in addition to psychological and social treatments, are a cornerstone of psychiatric care. Yet recently, the public conversation has too often been dominated by misinformation rather than rigorous science, sowing doubt into the safety and effectiveness of well-established mental health treatments. Psychiatric medications save lives, and have overwhelming evidence to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness when prescribed responsibly by trained medical professionals. Without steady, transparent, and evidence-based guidance from public health leaders at all levels, both patients and providers are left vulnerable to confusion, hesitation, and harm.
 Vaccines, autism, and public trust

The persistence of myths linking vaccines to autism is particularly troubling. The evidence is clear: Vaccines save lives and do not cause autism. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, and equating it with vaccine injury perpetuates stigma while undermining public health. Rates of autism diagnosis are increasing largely due to a wider recognition of the symptoms of autism, growing prevalence of screening programs in pediatric health care and schools, and a wider availability of early intervention programs that demonstrate efficacy in improving overall functioning and quality of life for people living with autism. When national institutions fail to forcefully counter this misinformation and provide clear guidance, vaccine hesitancy grows, preventable illnesses return, and vulnerable populations suffer. 
Threats to Medicaid and Medicare
For many New Hampshire residents, Medicaid and Medicare are lifelines. These programs ensure access to lifesaving health care, medications, and long-term supports. Unfortunately, these programs face continual threats, from budget cuts, eligibility restrictions, and political battles that treat health care as a bargaining chip. Patients with psychiatric illness, many of whom already navigate stigma and barriers to care, cannot afford further uncertainty as to whether they’ll continue receiving these benefits.
A call for responsible leadership
Granite Staters, and all Americans, deserve leadership at all levels, including the DHHS, that centers science, transparency, and the health of its people. That means issuing clear, evidence-based public guidance on medications, vaccines, autism, and the benefits of Medicaid and Medicare. It means actively combating misinformation. It means vigorously defending the integrity of Medicaid and Medicare as essential programs for our most vulnerable citizens. Recent misinformation, including attacks on the safety of vaccines and psychiatric medications, is eroding the public’s trust in and access to safe and effective health care. 
In the current environment, we urge providers and patients to seek guidance from authoritative and trusted sources that remain committed to an evidence-based and transparent approach to health care. Examples of trusted sources free from ideological biases include national professional societies including the American College of Physicians, the American Association of Pediatrics, the American College and Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Psychiatric Association. Similarly, state level public health experts are in the early stages of collaborating to provide evidence-based guidelines regarding public health and vaccines. Examples include the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative.  
As psychiatrists, we will continue to advocate for our patients in clinics, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, and communities across the state and nationally. But we cannot do it alone and we call upon DHHS leadership, the policymakers who oversee it, and professional societies nationwide to fulfill their responsibility not only to Granite Staters but all Americans: to lead with science, to protect the vulnerable, and to safeguard the future health of us all.

Courtesy photo.An Ohio lawmaker wants judges to consider a defendant’s immigration status when they set conditions for bail or hand down criminal sentences.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, characterized the changes as a way to give judges “a full picture” of the defendant before them.
But critics argue the proposal might violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause or encroach on the federal authority over immigration enforcement.
More generally, they worry the measure targets immigrants — whether here legally or not — at a moment of rising fear and distrust of justice system. People with a target on their back, they argue, aren’t likely to report crimes or testify in court.
What the bill does
When it comes to setting bail, the central question a judge must consider is whether the defendant show up for their court date.
But state law carries a laundry list of other considerations judges should weigh when determining bail, parole or sentences. Did the defendant serve in the military? Did they exhibit remorse?  Do they have ties to the community? In 2022, state lawmakers even went to the ballot to explicitly direct judges to weigh whether a defendant is a threat to public safety when setting the amount of cash bail.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 282 would add the defendant’s immigration status to that list. Williams thinks judges should be considering whether a defendant is in the country illegally or subject to a federal detainer when they’re setting conditions.
“It’s always a factor, one, in bail, whether or not an individual is going to return to court,” Williams said. “I think immigration status has a direct effect on that, whether or not an individual is going to be here to answer to justice or not at the conclusion of the case.”
When it comes to criminal sentences and parole, Williams contends, a defendant’s immigration status should be given the same weight as their criminal history.
“Just like probation and parole, if you are actively on those at the time that you commit an offense, and you are an American citizen, that goes against the idea of you being able to be rehabilitated, absent incarceration,” Williams said. “I think it also should be a factor that an individual is here unlawfully, already breaking the law in the state of Ohio and they commit another criminal offense.”
Committee questions
Williams’ proposal got pushback from Democratic committee members, including state Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus. He pressed Williams on the Supremacy Clause, which gives the federal government exclusive authority to enforce federal laws. Mohamed noted several states have passed laws wading into immigration enforcement and it hasn’t gone well.
“There’s about five to seven different bills that were passed in other states that were all struck down,” Mohamed said.
Williams insisted those other measures gave local authorities policing powers or made federal violations state crimes as well.
“There’s no federal statute, there’s no constitutional revision that prevents an individual from, especially a judge from considering immigration status as it comes to bond conditions or sentencing,” Williams said.
Mohamed asked about the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which applies to “any person” within a state’s jurisdiction.
“It doesn’t make any distinction with U.S. citizens, green card holders, noncitizens,” he said. “So essentially, if this will directly lead to judges that are imposing harsher sentences, how do you reconcile that with the 14th Amendment.”
Williams didn’t deny the provision would subject immigrants to greater scrutiny.
“I think it’s reasonable that individuals that are here, legally or illegally, are held to a high standard, just like individuals that are facing parole, probation or bond conditions in another case,” he said.
Instead, Williams contends treating immigrants differently isn’t an issue because immigration status is not a suspect category under the 14th Amendment. He pointed to analysis by state legislative researchers which draws a distinction between immigration status and the race, ethnic background, gender or religion protections found in state law.
Researchers point to an Ohio case where the appeals court upheld a lower court considering a defendant’s immigration status when imposing a felony sentence.
“Courts have done it before. It’s been upheld before,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable to use that classification, because it’s not a suspect classification that gets protection under the equal protections clause.”
But notably — and Williams acknowledged as much — judges already have the discretion to consider a defendant’s immigration status. State law includes a catch all “any other factors that are relevant” in its instructions to the bench.
To Williams, though, that flexibility is treacherous.
“I think it can lead to sentencing disparities where in one jurisdiction, an immigrant would have been seen — viewed more harshly, (and) in another jurisdiction, they will be seen, more lenient,” he said. “I think we need to have consistency across the state of Ohio.”

Ohio’s official regulator in 2023 allowed a huge increase in the fixed monthly charges Columbia Gas could collect from all residential customers. 
They all have to pay the same fees, no matter how rich or poor they are, and no matter the size or density of their dwellings. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio accepted Columbia Gas’s claims that it needed the money for infrastructure improvements even though its parent company is turning nearly $800 million in annual profit and its CEO makes $33,000 a day. But next month the question of whether those increased charges are in the public interest is headed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
The cost of utilities — what you have to pay to light and heat your home — have been exploding in Ohio. 
Some of that is attributable to increased electricity demand from the AI boom. But the PUCO has also been criticized for being too quick to OK upcharges requested by electricity and natural gas providers. As of 2020, it had granted more than $1 billion in increased charges to utilities only for the Ohio Supreme Court to later declare them illegal. Even so, the utilities got to keep the money.
With 1.5 million customers, Columbia is the largest natural gas supplier in the state. Its service area includes Columbus and Cleveland.
In 2023, the PUCO allowed the utility to increase its fixed charges by 50% — to as much as $57 a month by 2027. As of July, that amount was $53 a month, according to a de-identified bill viewed by the Capital Journal.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXControversially, the charges are shouldered by all customers equally, whether you’re a millionaire living in an 8,000-square-foot mansion on a five-acre lot in New Albany, or if you’re a single mother in a 500-square-foot apartment in North Linden.
Karin Nordstrom of the Ohio Environmental Council said high, one-size-fits-all fixed charges also discourage conservation.
“High fixed charges are bad for consumers because they remove their ability to control their bill,” she said. “They can’t reduce how much they get charged every month by reducing usage. It removes an incentive to reduce usage and it puts more overall strain on the household budget.”
In their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio said the PUCO ruling is not in the public interest because it allows Columbia to get 70% of its revenue from fixed charges and just 30% from the gas it actually delivers.
“The result of such a significant imbalance between fixed and variable charges is that the potential savings for customers through either energy efficiency measures or otherwise reducing usage are minimized because only thirty cents on every dollar spent on bills correlates to the actual gas they use,” the appeal said.
It also cites “the manifest unfairness in charging customers over $50 per month before they use the first therm of gas” as a reason why the charges are not in the public interest. It adds that “a low-volume consumer in a 500 square-foot house does not drive system costs in the same way as a customer in a 5,000 square-foot home.”
For its part, Columbia Gas asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal. It said it hadn’t raised fixed charges since 2008.
It also said energy efficiency doesn’t figure in determinations of whether a change in rate structure is in the public interest. 
“Similarly, this Court has heard, and rejected, arguments that Ohio’s energy policies require the (PUCO) to approve some arbitrary level of funding for energy efficiency programs that matches an appellant’s policy preferences,” Columbia Gas argued. 
And it quoted expert testimony in an earlier proceeding saying it was actually more fair to charge everyone the same amount in fixed charges for infrastructure, regardless of how much of a burden they placed on it.
The witness said “‘fixed charges promote fairness to all customers because the customer’s bill reflects the actual average cost of providing gas delivery service(,) rather than being based on the volume of gas consumed,’” the Columbia Gas filing said.
A spokeswoman for the company was asked whether Columbia would commit to spending all the additional revenue it collects from the increased charges on service to the people who paid it. She was also asked whether the company needed the money, given that parent company NiSource collected nearly $800 million in profit last year and paid CEO Lloyd Yates $12.8 million.
“Columbia Gas does not comment on ongoing litigation,” the spokeswoman replied.
Oral arguments in the case are set for Oct. 29.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Growing up, Salem Carmicheal’s family lived paycheck to paycheck, so she never considered college an option. She had always been interested in early childhood education, but didn’t think she’d be able to pursue a degree until she discovered that through the state program she could attend Eastern Maine Community College for free.
“If I didn’t go to community college for free, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go to any college,” she said.
“For a while there, it kind of saved me as a person, because I was living in my car for a little bit, but I still didn’t have to worry about college being free.”
Carmichael is now preparing to graduate after completing internships in daycares and classrooms and working at the Bangor YMCA.
“Now that I’m in a better place, I’m actually thriving,” she said. “Free college is an amazing thing, I’ve been thoroughly impacted by it positively.”
Students throughout Maine have similar stories as Carmichael. Students who were not considering college as an option, or planned to work directly after school, or were considering taking on debt to attend a four-year university when they learned about Maine’s free community college program, according to several interviews and public testimony submitted by students to the Maine Legislature. 
Free college, flexibility help drive increased enrollment in Maine’s community colleges

Since its establishment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, the scholarship has allowed all recent high school graduates to attend one of Maine’s seven community colleges for free, even if they don’t qualify for federal financial aid. The program has led to increased enrollment in community colleges and even contributed to an increase in transfer students attending the University of Maine System. 
But the future of that program, which is only guaranteed to include those who graduated high school in 2025, is uncertain.
Legislative ‘limbo’
When crafting the two-year budget earlier this year, the Maine Legislature was wrestling with a sizable deficit, which it made several cuts to address. Among those, the budget committee rejected Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed language to fund the free tuition program on an ongoing basis and codify it in statute, instead giving the Maine Community College System a reduced amount for the current biennium, which will help the system continue to offer free college to the high school graduating class of 2025. 
The community college system is concerned that means the scholarship is effectively over. But several members of the Legislature who have been supportive of the initiative have said they intend to continue prioritizing funding it for future years. 
The heads of the budget committee, Sen. Margaret Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) and Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), told the community college system in a July letter that the Legislature needs more information from the system to evaluate the impact of free community college. They asked for detailed cost estimates for the current and following budget cycles, including how much it costs to include nonresidents and students who didn’t graduate from a Maine high school. They also sought data on graduation rates, how many graduates stay in Maine, and potential economies of scale.
“The committee votes did not reflect a final decision on the value of the program so much as a desire for additional information and study of the relative costs and benefits of the program to the state and the participants,” Rotundo and Gattine wrote.
That information, which is due by mid-December, will be considered by either the education or budget committee as they weigh changes to the two-year budget in a change package next session, the chairs said.
Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland), who sits on both committees, said free community college “has been enormously successful and has been a big benefit to students in the state of Maine.” 
“There’s no intent to end the program, and there was never any intent during this last legislative session on either the education committee or the appropriations committee to discontinue the program,” he added.
A spokesperson for House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) also said the Legislature’s actions do not mean the program is ending, and that “the Speaker is committed to working with lawmakers to review the program with the goal of continuing to fund future graduating classes.”   
However, the lack of ongoing funding means the community college can’t promise free tuition to  graduates beyond the class of 2025, according to David Daigler, president of the Maine Community College System. The system sent out a press release at the end of the session saying the program had ended, which was widely reported throughout the state. But Daigler also said he’s continuing to work with lawmakers and is interested to see what they do next session.
“I think they understand that by not having an ongoing funding mechanism, and by not having language that says, ‘This is our intent,’ after the class of 2025, there really isn’t a free college program. But then they say, ‘We don’t want it to end,’” Daigler said.
“Right now, we’re sitting in limbo.”
Maine alone is walking back free college
Approximately 35 states have some version of free college, but Maine is currently the only state to walk back the initiative, according to two national researchers. 
Since 2014 when Tennessee became the first state in the country to offer free community college, many states have started their own programs, either focused on high school graduates, adult learners or both. 
In addition to Tennessee, California and  New Mexico have established a permanent funding mechanism for the program and don’t require annual legislative approval. But in most states, tuition-free community college programs are funded annually, or semi-annually by the legislature, “which definitely is a problem when you’re trying to create predictability,” according to Michelle Miller-Adams, a senior researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a professor of political science at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.










In every study that I've seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It's just a matter of fronting the cost.


– Ryan Morgan, CEO of The Campaign for Free College Tuition


“We’ve seen states create and continue free college programs over the last four or five years. Maine seems to be the only state right now going in the opposite direction,” said Ryan Morgan, CEO of national non-profit The Campaign for Free College Tuition.
When states offer free college, it boosts the economy and helps create a more educated workforce which results in higher tax revenue for the state, studies from other free college programs have shown. 
While Maine’s program is too new to be studied, Morgan said, “It’s a no-brainer. A more educated workforce is going to have economic benefits, increase tax revenues, support businesses and also make a significant impact in the lives of the students.”
“In every study that I’ve seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It’s just a matter of fronting the cost,” Morgan said.
Since most other New England states have some version of a free college program, Maine also risks losing students to neighboring states if it does not continue its tuition-free community colleges, Morgan said.
Miller-Adams also emphasized that while many community college students would likely qualify for a Pell Grant or other state or federal scholarships, by simplifying the process it makes it more accessible to those who may not otherwise apply.
“It’s the message that gets delivered that says: ‘You might think college is unaffordable, but guess what? Tuition is going to be covered.’”
Free community college helped broaden options
Tom McNeil, a high school counselor at Winslow High School, also said he’s noticed more students and families opening up to the idea of college.
“Changing the discussion around college affordability, which is what I think free community college has done, has made it easier for people to decide to go to school,” McNeil said.“It’s less scary from a financial perspective, so the kids and their families are a little more ready to take a risk.”
The rate of Winslow High School students continuing their education has been relatively stable for the last eight years, he said, but more students took advantage of the tuition-free community colleges, in lieu of either attending a four-year school or just trying out a few classes.
It’s too soon to tell how the class of 2026 might be impacted if the program ends, but McNeil said his biggest fear “is that it lets an old, unhelpful narrative take hold, that college is not affordable or no longer worth it.”
“This initiative has been a great way to combat that.”

Current and former students vouch for free college
Sam Parker had no plans of going to college, and was working in carpentry when his brother sent him a link to the free college program website. 
Parker, who grew up in Newfield, decided to enroll in Southern Maine Community College’s automotive technology program. He now has a job working for a Subaru dealership, and said he’s on a career path because he was able to go to community college for free.
“It just gives people another option,” he said.
Similarly, South Portland native Abby Steinhagen took a gap year after graduating high school, unsure whether she would apply to a four-year institution. But upon hearing about tuition-free community college, she also decided to start at the automotive program and is working at Arundel Ford as she finishes her degree.
“It’s taken a lot of stress from having to pay student loans,” she said. “I already work two jobs, but I would not be able to work the jobs that I need to be able to finance something like this if it wasn’t free.”
The automotive technology program was originally set up by local dealerships who were in need of technicians, said Ruth Morrison, who runs the 90-student associate degree program. Because free college helped enrollment grow, there were 25 new technicians working at shops last summer, she said.
“There are so many specialized fields nowadays that you really need those extra two years of education to get a job that’s going to sustain you and in the economy,” she said.
Jordyn Balicki had committed to attending a four-year nursing program at Husson University when she learned about free community college, and ended up changing her mind last minute and enrolled atEastern Maine Community College.
“I would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at Husson, so this was huge stress relief,” she said. She added that being able to work as a Resident Assistant her second year to cover room and board costs while doing externships at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor “helped me actually make money while going to school.”
Balicki now works as a nurse, and appealed to the Maine Legislature this session to continue free college for future high school graduates. 
“It was something I definitely didn’t think I was going to do and now I urge everyone to go to a community college,” she said.
“Really, not offering free college from now on is only harming the workforce in Maine.”

The two attended an event at Maceli's in Lawrence this month. (Jeffery Burkhead)The University Press of Kansas has built a distinguished reputation over the past eight decades as a publisher of scholarly works and books of interest to Sunflower State residents.
It has also worked closely with Kansas Reflector authors. Founding opinion editor C.J. Janovy wrote the definitive book about LGBTQ+ activism in Kansas, “No Place Like Home,” while Sunday columnist Max McCoy contributed “Elevations: A Personal Exploration of the Arkansas River.” Both writers have thought and felt deeply about this state, and I’m honored to join their company.
That’s right, my first book through the press will come next year. It will cover Kansas opinion writers of the past and what they have to teach us today. I’ve also signed to write a second book for the press, and that’s where my guest on this week’s Kansas Reflector podcast comes into the picture.


His name is Alec Loganbill, and he’s the editor of a new imprint from UPK called Plainspoken Books.
“We’ve been doing Kansas general interest books for some time, and this is an outgrowth and an evolution of that vision into something bigger,” Loganbill told me. “So Plainspoken Books is is really interested in telling authentic Midwest stories and getting them in front of a national readership. I’m thinking about Midwest politics, environmental issues, cultural stories, history, investigative journalism, anything that really has an authentic Midwest flavor, and is in that sort of nonfiction realm.”
The imprint’s first book, “Whirlwind: My Life Reporting the News,” by broadcast news icon Bill Kurtis, came out this month.

 

	
Loganbill and the Press were on hand in recent weeks as Kurtis promoted his book in Lawrence and at the Kansas Book Festival in Topeka (airline delays meant the latter event occurred via Zoom). You can find the volume at all good bookstores and online.
“It’s been an absolute treat to work with Bill,” Loganbill said. “He’s an absolute professional and has an excellent story to tell, and has been a very collaborative partner with all of us.”
More is coming. Kansas City author Chris Arnone’s “My Name Was Baby: An Intersex Memoir” will arrive next fall. McCoy will also have a new book, tentatively titled “God’s Misfits.” (Want a preview? You can read his columns on the shocking case here.)
Former Kansas poet laureate and Reflector contributor Huascar Medina has signed up for “Prairie Fool,” described by the press as “a lyrical meditation on politics, class, and culture.”
My contribution will be a volume with the provisional title “In the Shadow of Trump,” examining how Kansas politics has been shaped (and misshapen) throughout the past decade thanks to the influence of a certain president. I’m not interested in writing about Trump, mind you — more how the shockwaves from his persona and politics have changed this state’s formerly sedate politics.
“That trio from the Reflector really speaks to another reason behind why we felt like we could pull this off, and there are really, really incredible writers here in Kansas and in the Midwest,” Loganbill said. “There are award-winning journalists, there are New York Times bestselling authors, there are nationally recognized poets and creative writers. We really have just a lot of literary talent in the Midwest. And so not only did I feel we had the importance of story to build this out, but we had the literary talents to tell those stories, and the Reflector was an obvious first door to knock on.”
When fully up and running, Plainspoken Books should issue about 12 books a year, the editor said. As a whole, UPK publishes about 50 books a year, working out to roughly one a week. Spend some time with their catalogue and prepare to be overwhelmed.
Loganbill still wants to find great writers and manuscripts, too. While many people imagine writing a book one day or another, not many actually sit down to do it, or sit down to do so in collaboration with an editor.
“I’m always looking for projects, for pitches, for ideas, for really any stage,” he said. “If there’s a talented writer with a story to tell, I’d love to talk.”

(Hollie Adams/Getty Images)Elections have consequences. So do Senate confirmations. Never has that been clearer than a recent warning from the government about pregnancy, another indication that science apparently no longer counts in regards to public health.
More on that below. First, some recent news in which Nebraska’s two U.S. senators — principals in the aforementioned confirmation process — were prominent: one with her take on free speech, the other to announce his intention to keep his job. Both were stories of some import but paled when we consider that at about the same time the republic was lurching further alist in an unruly, fact- and science-free sea.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., told Nebraska Public Media in an interview earlier this month that she’s on board with the First Amendment in the aftermath of activist Charlie Kirk’s murder. She said, “Oh, I’m a strong supporter of free speech, but reactions like we’ve seen in some cases, where they are celebrating an assassination, celebrating a murder, that is not free speech, and those people need to be held responsible for the disgusting, horrible things that they are saying. It’s not free speech to celebrate the death of someone or to encourage attacks on other people. That’s not free speech. There, there is no issue that that kind of talk should be supported in any way whatsoever.”
The senator’s notion that such “talk” should go unsupported surely has plenty of support. That said, “disgusting, horrible” discourse, speech you and I might abhor, is nonetheless protected speech according to a long line of legal precedent such as Skokie v. National Socialist Party of America. Any speaker is open to the consequences of such speech, but unless it falls within the narrow confines of defamation, obscenity, threats or fighting words, incitement or fraud, the speaker has the Constitutional right to utter even the most heinous words without the government (Looking at you, FCC.) preclusion, censorship or punishment.
For his part, U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., announced his intention to run as an incumbent in 2026. He touted his work in the Senate, his support of the current administration’s economic and immigration policies and his belief that his opponent, Dan Osborn, was a “fake” independent. Osborn responded by calling Ricketts a “fake senator.” 
Discussions about free speech can be enlightening. Plus, we could raise the civics conversation bar if more of our informed interactions centered on constitutional rights. 
I suppose back-and-forths over who’s real and who isn’t can temporarily entertain us — maybe even provide some comic relief from the drudgery of a political campaign — but one hopes the candidates raise the level of debate going forward. 
Speaking of raising the level of discussion, we’ve watched a verbose scolding of world leaders, an inexplicable summoning of our top military brass and, as of this writing, the readying for a government shutdown (followed surely by a blame game). Meanwhile, the president and his confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, without qualifying evidence, officially told pregnant women they should avoid an over-the-counter medication that has kept mothers-to-be and their children safe for years. They insist, without offering proof, that the medication increases the chances of a child being born on the autism spectrum.
They are objecting to acetaminophen, which most of us know as Tylenol. While the president and secretary offered no studies that would underscore the importance of avoiding Tylenol during pregnancy, the FDA responded the next day. It said “a causal relationship has not been established, and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature. It is also noted that acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter drug approved for use to treat fevers during pregnancy, and high fevers in pregnant women can pose a risk to their children. Additionally, aspirin and ibuprofen have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.”
The secretary has his job in part because of our aforementioned senators’ votes. If you’re keeping score at home, the final tally in the Senate was 52-48 for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation. His hearing was not without contention, although his history as a vaccine skeptic was front and center, not acetaminophen. His promise at those hearings to keep vaccines accessible has dimmed, too, with HHS’s recent policy changes pitting its recommendations against those of medical provider associations.
I’d be curious if either of our senators, supporters enough of the current HHS secretary to give him the department’s corner office, feel any responsibility toward their constituents to explain why a potentially dangerous public health policy is being created without the proper science to support it? 
Surely Nebraskans would want an explanation of those consequences.

(Screenshot by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A state map showing “environmental justice” communities is back online, after the state lost access, in a Trump administration purge, to federal data about communities considered overburdened by pollution and underserved by government services.
But the Maryland Department of the Environment removed race, ethnicity and language data from the calculus that determines an area’s environmental justice score on the updated map, leaving some environmental advocates scratching their heads.
Brandywine — a majority-Black Prince George’s County community surrounded by gas-fired power plants, a coal ash dump, a Superfund site and more — has long been considered a poster child for environmental injustice in Maryland. After being ranked above the 75th percentile in the previous map, a qualifier for more careful scrutiny in environmental permitting, it now has a score of 63 out of 100.
“It’s just a map change. It’s not a reality change,” said Brandywine community leader Kamita Gray. “It just appears to me that MDE blatantly does not want to be accountable in the massive pollution and the overburden of these heavy industrial industries.”
Industrial facilities applying for a permit must list the area’s environmental justice score, and Gray worries that Brandywine’s lowered score will make it even easier for polluting facilities to win new or more flexible permits, despite the fact that residents already feel inundated, particularly by air pollution.
In a statement, MDE spokesman Jay Apperson said the agency redesigned the map after the federal data loss “with pre-downloaded federal data and Maryland-specific data from our agency and the Maryland Department of Health.”

The agency website containing the map warns that race and other categories are not included in the environmental justice score calculation, but adds that the data is still available on the site “for informational purposes only.”
“Collecting and displaying this data allows users to evaluate the relationships between demographics and pollution burden, and can be used to better understand issues related to environmental justice and racial equity in Maryland,” reads the message. “MDE cautions users against using the ‘Underserved’ map layer, or its subcategories, in any manner that would be considered discriminatory under applicable law.”
MDE, which handles environmental permitting, argues that it “consider[s] the overburdened nature of all communities when evaluating the adequacy of permit conditions,” particularly when it comes to communities over the 75th percentile on the map, Apperson said.
With an overall score of 63, Brandywine falls out of that percentile, but it has scores above 75 for at least five key indicators, so it still receives a more careful review, Apperson said.
MDE also argues that the updated environmental justice map, called MDEnviroScreen, also includes a number of beneficial new features, including a new climate change vulnerability score and a more user-friendly design.
Sacoby Wilson, a University of Maryland professor focused on environmental justice issues, said he believes that the racial data was removed from the Maryland map in response to President Donald Trump’s (R) crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion programming, which he codified in an executive order on his first day back in office.
“They’re trying to shy away from that kind of scrutiny. So, I get that,” Wilson said. “Now, what it’s done is, it’s a less-inclusive tool by excluding race.”
Wilson believes that, even if MDE continues excluding race, there are ways to strengthen the map with “race-proximal” indicators that show whether an area has suffered from racist policies, such as redlining, for example. He points to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development’s “Just Communities” tool, which takes into account homeownership rates, residential vacancy rates and more.
“We are working to explore race-proximal, race-adjacent indicators that are not race specifically, but capture the experience of racism,” Wilson said. “We are engaging with MDE to provide them with guidance and input on the types of indicators that could be really useful.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
MDE did not respond to questions about whether the map change came in response to anti-DEI pronouncements from the Trump administration.
During a July news conference in Baltimore, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that a loss of access to federal data at the beginning of Trump’s administration forced MDE’s map offline originally. The Trump administration removed the Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice map shortly after taking office, spurring a lawsuit from environmental groups.
At the July event, Moore touted the fact that Maryland brought the tool back online without the need for federal inputs.
“Just because we no longer have a willing partner in the federal government does not mean we just sit there now and take it,” Moore said. “We mobilize, and we step up, and that is why we are updating our environmental justice map to operate independently from our federal sources.”
Moore then signed an executive order requiring state agencies to reference the map during decision-making and produce reports on their efforts to uphold environmental justice, among other requirements.
After the MDE map was taken down, Jennifer Kunze, the Maryland organizing director for Clean Water Action, said she waited “on pins and needles” for its return. The result was disappointing, she said.
It isn’t just Brandywine, Kunze said. She said that the tool seems to struggle to account for environmental justice concerns in the state’s rural areas, lowering scores for areas near Eastern Shore poultry houses, and the former Luke Paper Mill site in Allegany County.
Kunze is among a group of advocates working on the next iteration of the CHERISH Our Communities Act, a bill that failed in the last legislative session, that would have set new requirements for pollution permits in environmental justice communities, and expressly let MDE deny permits on environmental justics grounds. Last year’s bill included all Census tracts with a score at or above 75 — and a 1.5-mile radius around them.
“Folks doing EJ organizing on the ground and living in frontline communities know what communities need to be covered by protections like the CHERISH Act and this tool — the way it’s currently calculated — leaves some of them out,” Kunze said.
Moore signs environmental justice order, amid federal government’s anti-DEI push

Wilson, who has also worked on the bill, said the group is considering alternatives for this year’s bill, including lowering the threshold, using a different measurement, or allowing communities with a score over a certain level to opt in to receive additional scrutiny during environmental permitting.
In August, Gray sent a letter to MDE leadership on behalf of the Brandywine/TB Southern Region Neighborhood Coalition, urging them to publish the rationale for dropping race, ethnicity, language and age data from the environmental justice score, and conduct an audit assessing the scores rendered by the new map. She said the previous EPA environmental justice map put Brandywine in the 97th percentile.
Gray was among the advocates who filed a 2016 federal civil rights complaint, arguing that an effort to place a new power plant near the community violated anti-discrimination law. The complaint resulted in a settlement with Maryland agencies.
Gray said that while the Moore administration has been more vocal about upholding environmental justice, including by signing its recent executive order, she continues to see be frustrated by permit decisions and potential new facilities, including a proposed concrete batching facility.
“It’s stopping nothing on the ground,” Gray said.
Greg Sawtell, a community advocate in Baltimore’s Curtis Bay, agreed. That community abuts the Curtis Bay coal piers, and is close to a number of other industrial facilities. A medical waste incinerator, which paid a historic fine for pollution in 2013, sits across Curtis Creek.
Sawtell, the zero-waste just transition director with the South Baltimore Community Land Trust, said the community has continued to track pollution events with cameras and air monitors, including puffs of dark black smoke emitted by the incinerator and clouds of coal dust from the piers.

Brown/Maryland Matters)A group of Medicaid recipients has sued the Maryland Department of Health for a “dysfunctional” system of determining eligibility for services that they say has denied services to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The failure of the department’s annual “redetermination” process has already caused a number of recipients to lose coverage, the suit says, and has the potential to expose thousands of disabled Marylanders with disabilities to institutionalization or homelessness as they lose the services that allow them to live independently.
The lawsuit was also brought by The Arc Montgomery County, a service provider, which says it has provided $9 million in care to clients since January 2024 for Developmental Disabilities Administration services that have not been reimbursed by the state.
The suit, filed Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, seeks to be certified as a class action on behalf of all 18,000 state Medicaid recipients
“The breakdown of Maryland’s Medicaid redetermination process threatens to a have a disastrous impact on Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” Kevin Docherty, the lead attorney in the suit, said in a statement from The Arc Montgomery County.
A spokesperson for the health department said Friday that the agency “does not comment on litigation.”
People with developmental disabilities seeing Medicaid coverage lapse more often

The named plaintiffs in the case — Ursula Battle, Constance Farrell, Frank Lee and Yolanda Puzzo — are all participants in the Community Pathways program, one of three “waiver” programs offered under Maryland’s Medicaid system, along with Community Supports and Family Supports. The services are jointly funded by the state and federal governments.
The suit says Community Pathways is “the most comprehensive waiver, paying for residential services, such as group homes; support services, including behavioral support, environmental assessments, caregiver training, and education; and day services, including employment support.”
Community Supports is similar, but does not include a residential component. Family Supports is for care of children from birth to age 21.
Participants in all the waiver programs have to prove eligibility annually. Recipients can earn up to three times the monthly Supplemental Security Income payment — currently $2,901 a month, according to the suit — and still be eligible.
Annual redeterminations were suspended in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when states were prohibited from canceling Medicaid coverage for most recipients. But redetermination was restarted in May 2023 and advocates, and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, say the department has struggled to keep pace with applications since then.
“Redetermination should be a straightforward process, but, for Marylanders with IDD [intellectual and development disabilities], it is not,” says the lawsuit. “Since May 2023, MDH has disenrolled people with IDD from DDA waiver programs in violation of the due process rights they are afforded under federal and state law. Many longtime participants in the waiver programs have been disenrolled without notice, a meaningful opportunity to be heard, or a reasoned decision from MDH regarding their eligibility.”
Among the problems since redetermination restarted, the lawsuit says, are notices sent to the wrong address — in many cases, an address that The Arc Montgomery County has not used for more than five years — and a failure to notify recipients that their services are in danger of being cut off. The department routinely fails to acknowledge receipt of redetermination paperwork or says it did not receive an application — sometimes by sending a notice to the wrong address — and applicants’ phone calls and emails to the department are not returned.
Hundreds of recipients who did receive notice that they were being disenrolled got letters citing a part of the Maryland Code of Regulations that “does not exist, and has never existed,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When they appeal their disenrollment, recipients do not get a decision within the required 90 days and often go months without a hearing, the plaintiffs argue. And even though the state is supposed to continue services while an appeal is pending, it will “consistently terminate benefits upon MDH’s issuance of a disenrollment notice, leaving participants without benefits while they are seeking to correct MDH’s arbitrary and erroneous actions,” the suit says.
“On the whole, Maryland’s redetermination process is so opaque, dysfunctional and arbitrary that disenrolled DDA waiver participants, and even long-established provider organizations like The Arc Montgomery County are unable to navigate it,” the lawsuit said.
Advocates said this summer, as the problem was becoming more evident, that the issue might be the result of a loss of experienced staff at the health department as it was hit with the Medicaid “unwinding” in 2023. That’s when it was forced to determine if everyone on the Medicaid rolls, which had ballooned to 1.8 million during the pandemic, was still eligible.
By summer 2024, state officials had reduced Medicaid rolls to 1.69 million, and that number was down to prepandemic levels of about 1.5 million as of May 2025, according to the department.
There is no exact count of the number of of Medicaid recipients who may have been accidentally disenrolled. But, after complaints from advocates and caregivers, the department acknowledged in July that it had restored coverage for 263 people who had been erroneously disenrolled and said it was in the “process of continuing to do a full review of all the particular circumstances of which the disenrollments occurred.”
The Arc Montgomery County said that at least 30 people it supports, including the four named plaintiffs in the suit, have been erroneously disenrolled during redetermination, even though they continue to be financially eligible.
“We stand with our co-plaintiffs and all Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities in this fight to secure the rights and benefits to which they are entitled,” said Daria Cervantes, CEO of The Arc Montgomery County, in a prepared statement.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_dda_advocacyday_fy26cuts-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s institutions of higher education are in trouble.
The University of West Florida is being run by Manny Diaz Jr., a former social studies teacher (and ex-Commissioner of Education) but, given that he’s Ron DeSantis’ choice, he’ll likely get the permanent position.
Florida Atlantic and Florida International have had undistinguished former legislators imposed on them; and USF president Rhea Law has announced her resignation, creating an opening for another DeSantis-friendly politician.
At the University of Florida, our supposed flagship institution, the provost is interim, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Law, and Arts are being run by interim deans, and 30 chair or director positions are vacant.
This obvious dysfunction has not gone unnoticed: The best and brightest academics are not exactly enthusiastic about working in Florida.
I’ve been teaching for more than 30 years; I love my job at Florida State — for now, at least. The students are wonderful (most of them), and I admire, even like, my colleagues (most of them).
Ron DeSantis hasn’t gotten around to trying to trash our reputation and cripple our academic freedom the way they have at New College, UWF, and UF.
Not yet, anyway.
The state’s “post-tenure review,” in which professors (who already undergo yearly reviews) must further justify their existence to the Board of Trustees, has driven some of the most productive academics out of Florida.
Nearly a third of Florida’s faculty want to leave the state.
If I were a young professor looking for a job, I’d avoid Florida.
Churn at UF
Our state government is authoritarian and proudly ignorant, hell-bent on destroying what makes universities great — freedom of expression, critical thinking, creativity, exposing students to ideas that may challenge them (or even upset them), unfettered research, scientific rigor, and advances in knowledge based on data.
Why would a scholar want to pursue a career in such a fact-resistant, small-minded, censorious state?
As has become its habit, the University of Florida has changed presidents. Again.
University of Florida Interim President Donald Landry. (Photo via UF X account)
Dr. Donald Landry has become UF’s interim president, replacing Kent Fuchs, the former interim president and one-time actual president who stepped back in when Ben Sasse, the unqualified spendthrift former president resigned under a cloud, and then had to stay on when the trustees’ choice, Dr. Santa Ono, who’d resigned as president of the University of Michigan to take the job at Florida, fell foul of the Board of  Governors’ anti-DEI hysteria.
This is not how serious institutions of higher education conduct themselves.
But then, Florida is not a serious place.
Enter Landry, late of the Columbia Center for Human Longevity and a medical doctor with “elite” Ivy degrees.
Landry seems positively giddy at becoming UF’s latest interim, calling it “the culmination of my career” and “the opportunity of a lifetime,” and demonstrates an Olympic-standard talent for sucking up, calling UF “a preeminent university in what one could argue is the preeminent state in this nation at this moment in time.”
He obviously wants the permanent job. The trustees obviously want him to have it: They’re paying him $2 million for this year, with the possibility of a $500,000 bonus.
If they don’t give him the permanent job, they have to pay him another $2 million.
Purge of academics
While the fact-based community knows Florida is Ground Zero for the climate crisis, Landry told UF’s right-wing trustees what they wanted to hear, insisting the science is “not settled,” even though the science is indeed settled: 97% of climate scientists agree on anthropogenic causes of global warming.
Maybe they should have asked him if the Theory of Gravity is sound or if the sun orbits the earth.
Or if he’ll defend professors’ freedom of speech.
DeSantis and his anti-education squad have passed laws banning anything that smells of DEI, clamped down on the honest study of American history, pitched hissy fits over pro-Palestinian campus protests, and railed against so-called “woke” professors who have the temerity to recognize that gay people exist, trans people exist, systemic racism is real, and science doesn’t care what you believe.
Now they’re going after educators who dare disparage Charlie Kirk.
Let’s stipulate that Kirk did not deserve his violent death. No one does.
He was a human being. He had as much right as the rest of us to speak his mind.
Which is the whole point.
A University of Miami neurologist was fired for posting, “What was done to Charlie Kirk has been done to countless Palestinian babies, children, girls, boys, women and men not just over the past two years of the ongoing genocide, but decades.”
A retired University of Florida law professor was stripped of his emeritus title for saying, “I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump.”
At FAU, three professors have been placed on administrative leave. One, a tenured professor of art history, didn’t comment on Kirk’s death, but re-posted others calling Kirk bigoted and racist.
It’s not illegal.
As the great Rick Wilson says, “tastelessness is not treason.”
‘Outrageous things’
Kirk identified as a “free speech absolutist,” declaring, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things,” even if you upset people.
Among the outrageous things Charlie Kirk said:
On journalist Joy Reid, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson being “affirmative action picks,” he said, “You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
On women: They should “submit to a godly man,” marry early, and have babies.
On Jews: “The philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors in the country.”
On guns: “I think it’s worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
As offensive, stupid, prejudiced, or karma-inviting as you or I might find what Kirk said, we live under a system of laws that protect his right to say it.
‘Civility’
The question is whether the DeSantis administration and Florida’s education establishment, including UF’s new president, understand that freedom of speech applies to all of us.
Donald Landry says he’s big on civility: “I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility.”
Christopher Rufo via Facebook
Landry enjoys the support of Christopher Rufo, who calls him “a principled leader who will reverse ideological capture and restore truth-seeking within the institution” at UF.
In case you’ve forgotten Rufo, he’s yet another pious conservative who likes to claim he cherishes free expression on campus, telling PBS News Hour in May the DeSantis administration has “expanded the range of discourse in higher education,” and boasting, “At New College of Florida, for example, where I’m a trustee, we have probably the widest range of discourse of any public university in the United States.”
A habit in Florida
Getting rid of a visiting professor who focuses on Black history contradicts Rufo’s smug assertion.
No one at New College accused Erik Wallenberg of incompetence or bad teaching or any other malfeasance.
But Rufo called him “a pure left-wing mad-lib” and sniffed, “New College will no longer be a jobs program for middling, left-wing intellectuals.”
Firing a professor because you don’t like his politics is not evidence of a wide range of discourse.
It’s also likely illegal.
Landry should take note and someone should alert him to Florida’s long, shameful history of McCarthyite attacks on academics.
In the late 1950s, the Legislature started investigating universities, determined to search out communists, biology professors who taught evolution, English professors who assigned “The Grapes of Wrath” and the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, and especially gay people in the student body or the faculty.
Scores were fired or expelled.
Perhaps former president/former interim president Kent Fuchs can tell Donald Landry about the time he, and UF trustees head Mori Hosseini, tried to ban four law professors from signing onto an amicus brief opposing a state law making it hard for former felons to vote, and stop three other professors  from testifying as expert witnesses on the ground that their actions might impede Ron DeSantis’ agenda.
Landry’s UF contract stipulates that a number of important decisions, including hiring, must be approved by Mori Hosseini — which means a highly partisan political appointee will exercise even more control over how the university works, what’s allowed, what’s censored.

Ned Lamont’s veto of House Bill 5002: An Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons and Senate Bill 8: Protections for Workers and Enhancements to Workers’ Rights.
What are these bills about and what will they do?
H.B. 5002 could be better named the “Democrats Hate Small Town Life in Connecticut Bill.” Among other things, it’s an attempt to mandate far left DEI housing policies into every city and town across the state. Many Democrats appear to believe that all local zoning ordinances are racist and discriminatory. Their solution for increasing the amount of low-income housing in Connecticut is to force the cities and towns to comply with state-issued mandates.
Democratically elected planning and zoning commissions determine local zoning ordinances. They reflect the needs of their municipalities and residents in accordance with current laws. H.B.5002 would sideline local commissions and put the power to decide where, what type and how much low-income housing will be built in the hands of state lawmakers. Compliance with the first version of this bill would have been devastatingly costly to small communities. Even the later, slightly watered down version would be financially problematic for many small towns.
H.B.5002 is nothing but a power grab for Democrat lawmakers in Hartford. It’s a crack in the door Democrats will use to push DEI policies into small communities with limited resources. Unaffordable housing is an inflationary problem of government’s own making. Homelessness is a combination of economic and social problems. But more regulations are not the answer.
Household income in Connecticut did not keep up with the housing market because we lack better job opportunities for our people. Why don’t Democrat lawmakers work to bring back the good paying manufacturing jobs they drove away with high taxes, high-energy costs and excess regulation? Then more people could afford to buy homes again. Governor Lamont was right to veto this bill.
Senate Bill 8 should have been called the “Taxpayers Funding Endless Strikes Bill.” S.B.8 aims to give unionized workers taxpayer funded unemployment benefits while out on strike. This is the second time Governor Lamont vetoed this bill.
If any company needs another reason to not do business in Connecticut, here’s one more manufactured by none other than our own legislature, with the help of public employee unions. How will employers react to the State of Connecticut injecting themselves into private labor negotiations? Would public funding of protracted strikes stifle job growth? You bet it would.
Try to imagine the effect it will have on state, county and municipal union contract negotiations. Public employees can go on strike against their employers, we the taxpayers, and we taxpayers must pay them unemployment benefits until they get what they want from us? Sounds more like legalized extortion than fair labor negotiations.
And all of this to be financed by an overtaxed population of Connecticut workers who (according to a 2022 Nutmeg Research Study) earn on average 40% less in pay and benefits than a State of Connecticut employee who does similar work. Governor Lamont was right to veto both of these bills. In this instance he stood up for the taxpayers, which is something Democrats in our legislature almost never do. Thank you, Governor Lamont.

Franklin understood that the great experiment of republican democracy requires action, and that people must work diligently to maintain such a precious form of self-government. Unlike the authoritarian governments of his time, where citizens were subjected to the demands of a ruler, democratic practices must be taught. Consequently, the civic education and engagement of an informed population are imperative in order for a democratic system of government to sustain and thrive.

State Rep. Kevin Brown
In 2023, Connecticut took a major step towards ensuring that our future generations are well-versed in the function of government and the importance of participation within their communities. Created in statute, the Civics Education, Civics Engagement & Media Literacy Task Force was formed to study the level of civic knowledge and engagement in our state, as well as our ability to navigate the ever-changing media platforms that exist in the modern 24-hour news cycle.  The bipartisan and diverse task force membership spent nearly a year checking the civic pulse of our state, only to find that while a variety of programs are working to increase participation in civic life, we fall short of truly preparing our youth to take the lead in their communities as they come of age.
As task force co-chair, a legislator, and most importantly a high school civics teacher, the dearth of civics education in our state causes me tremendous concern.  After decades of marginalized social studies instruction, due largely to a reliance on standardized testing to measure school performance, many students who enter our classrooms have little understanding of how their government works, or what their role in the process might be. 
In 2022, only 24 percent of U.S. students reached the “proficient” standard on the NAEP Civics Assessment. Volunteerism, which has seen a slight improvement since a major drop during covid, has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voter turnout in the last Connecticut municipal election cycle sat just above 30% statewide, and even lower in some of the communities with the greatest needs. 
With so many major issues facing our state and nation, it is easy to look past what many of us take for granted. Recent events, however, including assassinations of political figures on both sides of the aisle, should serve as a warning that a lack of civic knowledge and the ability to discern credible information can lead to an unhealthy distrust of the institution of government, vitriolic rhetoric, and a breakdown of democratic practices as we know them.


All hope is not lost, however. One simple way to encourage our youth to engage in their communities is to reward them for it.  In the 2025 legislative session, there was an opportunity to do just that with the passage of HB 7009, which included the establishment of a state seal of civics education, allowing graduates to earn a seal on their diploma certifying that they have shown proficiency in civic skills and engagement over the course of their high school career. 
While this bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives, it was not taken up in the Senate. As a state, we must make a commitment to our future and the future of democracy.  While there are many important legislative priorities each year, our ability to address these issues through the democratic process rests upon our ability to educate and engage the public in the practice. 
If children grow up learning how democratic government works, along with the impact their participation can have, they are more likely to engage in their communities as adults. If they can identify credible sources, they will develop opinions that are supported by hard evidence and be able to take meaningful informed action. 
We must put a high level of emphasis on civics and media literacy in the classroom throughout the K-12 experience. Partnering with organizations like the Connecticut Democracy Center, Connecticut Bar Association, and CT Humanities, among others, school districts can develop engaging curricula and provide opportunities for students and adults alike to see the value of civic participation. 
As the Constitution State, let us take the lead on this Constitution Day by paying democracy forward, prioritizing civic education, engagement, and media literacy, and guaranteeing that these subjects are prioritized in schools and communities across Connecticut.

Dover, Del. – Delaware has completed its first comprehensive property tax reassessment in over 40 years across all three counties: New Castle since 1983, Kent since 1987, and Sussex since 1974. This process was mandated following a 2018 lawsuit by civil rights groups, including the NAACP, which argued that outdated valuations led to inequities in school funding reliant on property taxes.
The reassessments, conducted by Tyler Technologies, revealed that residential property values surged, often by 400-500% or more, while commercial values rose more modestly or declined. The reassessment process aimed to be revenue-neutral, with tax rates adjusted down to result in no change in revenue for either the county or school districts. However, the shift in valuations between residential and commercial/non-residential properties significantly altered the tax burden. This disproportionately affected homeowners, with many facing tax increases of hundreds to thousands of dollars annually, particularly in New Castle County where the residential share of the tax burden jumped from 67% to about 76%. School districts in some areas also captured a 10% “windfall” in revenue allowed under state law, exacerbating the outcry.
Public frustration peaked in the summer of 2025, prompting an August 12 special legislative session where seven bills were passed for short-term relief. These included HB 242, which allows New Castle County school districts to reset and split tax rates for residential vs. non-residential properties for the 2025-2026 school year, reducing homeowner bills by shifting some burden back to commercial properties. HB 240 and HB 241 establish payment plans for residential taxes without penalties, interest, or liens if complied with, extending protections through 2026 for longer plans. SCR 122 mandates a statewide review of the reassessment process to ensure future ones (next in Kent 2029, New Castle/Sussex 2030) are fairer and more transparent. Other measures include quarterly reporting on payment plan data and protections against aggressive collection.
These were stopgap fixes; long-term reforms, including broader tax framework changes and exemptions, were deferred to 2026. In response, Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D-Newark), announced committee assignments on September 3, 2025, saying “The special committees… [are] tasked with investigating Delaware’s first statewide property reassessment in more than two generations… to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.” Democratic leaders have emphasized the committees as a transparent, bipartisan effort to review the reassessment process, gather public input, and develop long-term reforms, building on the August special session’s short-term relief measures.
Republicans have criticized the effort as lacking true bipartisanship, claiming their input, such as on bills like HB 73 to double senior credits, was sidelined. Per House Republican Minority Leader, Tim Dukes, and Minority Whip, Jeff Speigelmanj, “Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers… And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion… Republicans [were] not given input or advance notice about the new committees.”
The special committees are structured as separate but coordinated House and Senate committees, each with bipartisan membership. They focus on valuation methods, tax impacts, education funding ties, exemptions, and equity. The committees aim to probe Tyler Technologies’ methodologies, assess homeowner hardships, compare Delaware’s protections to other states, and develop a “roadmap” for equitable future reassessments and targeted relief, such as for seniors and fixed-income households.
The format includes four public hearings in the Senate Chamber at Legislative Hall (411 Legislative Avenue, Dover). All are open to the public, with in-person attendance and livestreaming available at legis.delaware.gov. No registration is required, but agendas and witness lists will be posted closer to the dates.
The updated meeting schedule as of mid-September 2025 is as follows:

Hearing #1: Tuesday, September 30, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. – The Recent Reassessment: Overview of the process, methodologies used by Tyler Technologies, lessons learned, and initial inequities identified.
Hearing #2: Week of October 6, 2025 (Exact date TBD; likely Monday/Tuesday) – Property Reassessment and the Law: Legal background, compliance issues, and guardrails for future cycles.
Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

Private schools in McDonough, Covington and Conyers received as much money as schools in in more populous places like Columbus, Savannah and Atlanta.

 
Of the total $7.1 million program funds distributed so far, most have gone to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, according to data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority, the state agency set up to manage the program.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
The remaining program funding spent this fall — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.

Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.

Rick Cleveland
Back to 2014.
Remember?
For a while there, both Mississippi State and Ole Miss both ranked among the nation’s top three football teams. State, coached by Dan Mullen, was No. 1. Ole Miss, coached by Hugh Freeze, was No. 3. At one point, both teams were a perfect 7-0. The college football world was astonished. Actually, so were most of us Mississippians. No, it didn’t last, but wasn’t it fun while it did?
Fast forward to Saturday: Ole Miss surely did its part, earning a solid, not-as-close-as-it-sounds 24-19 victory over previously No. 4 LSU to move to 5-0. After a slow start, the Rebels dominated LSU, nearly doubling the Tigers in total offense. In one of the most amazing stats you’ll see this year, the Rebels were penalized for nearly twice as much yardage (109) as LSU was able to gain (59) running the ball.
The Rebels, previously ranked No. 13, soared to No. 4. Trinidad Chambliss should enter the far-too-soon discussions of who might win the Heisman Trophy. And it is not in any way too soon for Chambliss to enter any discussion of the most interesting story in this, or any, college football season. From Division II Ferriss State and the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to Ole Miss and the SEC. From the D-II national championship to the FBS national championship contention. More on that later.
Meanwhile, in Starkville, Mississippi State did everything but knock off 15th ranked Tennessee. If State isn’t the most improved college football team in the nation, the Bulldogs are in the first sentence of any paragraph written on that subject. Southern Miss might be in the next sentence, and we’ll get to the Golden Eagles, too.
State led for much of the game and battled the Volunteers on even or better terms throughout. Watching the Bulldogs these days, it is hard to fathom that just a season ago they lost 10 games, nine by double digits, and defeated only one FBS team. But then, that’s the way it goes in today’s college football world in which if you have the money — and spend it wisely — you can turn over your roster and turn around your football fortunes in one offseason. State and head coach Jeff Lebby clearly spent wisely. 
Same goes for Southern Miss, which spent most wisely, it seems, on Charles Huff, the head coach who last year led Marshall to the Sun Belt Championship and brought with him to Hattiesburg 21 of the players who helped him win it. Clearly, the most critical of those Marshall transfers is quarterback Braylon Braxton, who has thrown for 11 touchdowns and run for another. In Saturday night’s 42-25 pasting of Jacksonville State (which clobbered USM 44-7 a year ago), three for two scores and ran for another and did not turn the ball over.
But let’s get back to Ole Miss, which appears to have all the necessary ingredients to make a run — not only to the FBS playoffs but in the playoffs, as well. Those ingredients include:

A special player at quarterback. Chambliss reminds me most of Kyler Murray, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2018, throwing for 42 touchdowns and running for 11 in leading the Oklahoma Sooners to an 11-2 record. What’s more, the Rebels have Austin Simmons, who opened the season as the starter, in reserve.
A balanced offense that also features running back Kewan Lacy and a host of speedy receivers. Lacy, who runs hard but can also make people miss, has run for 445 yards and eight touchdowns. He is what Ole Miss did not have – or at least did not utilize – last season.
Speed, speed, speed on defense. The Rebels run to the football and hit hard when they get there. Pete Golding continues to do a masterful job. LSU ran the ball 21 times for 59 yards.
Inside stoppers on defense. This was a perceived weakness with the Rebels losing first round draft pick Walter Nolen and also JJ Pegues. But Ole Miss looks at least as proficient with gargantuan tackle Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles promoted to fill the void. LSU couldn’t block them.
A sound kicking game. With the Ole Miss offense, the Rebels punter is often much like the Maytag repairman, but Australian Oscar Bird has been excellent when called upon. Placekicker Lucas Carneiro has hit 11 of 12 field goals, including three of four beyond 40 yards. 

The Ole Miss schedule, by SEC standards, is doable. The Rebels don’t have to play Alabama, Texas, Texas A&M, Missouri or Vanderbilt (yes, I just wrote that). They do play both Georgia and Oklahoma both on the road and back-to-back. South Carolina is no gimme and neither is Mississippi State for that matter. But again, in the SEC, it could be a whole lot worse.
The Rebels have a week off, before Washington State, a 59-10 loser to North Texas, visits for homecoming. Then, it’s at Georgia and at Oklahoma, back to back.
Will the bubble burst? Or will Trinidad Chambliss, the best story in college football, add to seemingly tall tale? We shall see.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/28143349/AP25271000675535.jpg,,,2025-09-28 15:56:57.711039

According to police reports there are multiple victims and the shooter is down. (Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Authorities say 10 people were shot, at least one fatally, and a fire broke out Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, about 50 miles north of Detroit.
Grand Blanc Township police said on social media that the suspected shooter “is down” and there was no ongoing threat to the public, with Chief William Renye later telling reporters that the incident began at 10:25 a.m. when a 40-year-old Burton man he drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church.
“He then exited his vehicle, firing several rounds at individuals within the church. Ten gunshot victims have been transported to local hospitals at this time. Including one who has been deceased,” Renye said.
Officers, including with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Grand Blanc Township, arrived on the scene a short while later and “engaged in gunfire with that particular individual, neutralizing that suspect,” Renye said, adding that the fire is thought to have been deliberately set by the shooter.
Multiple law enforcement agencies have responded to Sunday’s incident in Grand Blanc, including the Michigan State Police, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office and the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office.
FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media that the bureau was monitoring reports of the “horrific shooting and fire” and was assisting in the investigation.
“Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act,” Patel said. “Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also shared a statement on social media, saying her “heart was breaking for the Grand Blanc community.”
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful for the first responders who took action quickly.”
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based  in Salt Lake City, issued a statement, saying they were “deeply grateful” for the outpouring of support from around the world. 
“In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” Doug Andersen, a church spokesperson said.
The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after  the death of the church’s president, Russell M. Nelson, who died Saturday at 101 years old.
The Grand Blanc Township incident follows another church-related shooting in late June when a man wearing tactical gear and carrying multiple firearms entered the CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan before being fatally shot by church security. 
The shooter’s mother in that incident was reportedly a church member, and he had attended services several times over the past year.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — After South Dakota Democrats heard appeals to organize, recruit and raise money, the keynote speaker at their Saturday night fundraiser urged them to do something else: hope.
Jaime Harrison, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told a story from his earlier job as floor director for the U.S. House Democratic Caucus. He recalled how a woman who was cleaning his Capitol office picked up a picture frame, recognized his mother in the photo, and said she went to high school with his mom and remembered when she dropped out of high school to give birth.
Harrison said the encounter brought them both to tears.
“And she came over and she hugged me and she said, ‘I would have never guessed that Patricia Harrison’s son would be right here. You give me hope.’”

Harrison said the story is a reminder that success is possible “no matter where you start.”
South Dakota Democrats are starting the 2026 campaign season with nobody in a statewide elected office. They had nine of the Legislature’s 105 members until earlier this month, when one of their members defected to the Republican Party and left them with eight.
One of those eight, Rapid City Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, told the crowd Saturday night that “I cannot begin to tell you how good it feels to be in a room of more than seven Democrats.” 
There were actually about 200 Democrats gathered in the DoubleTree hotel ballroom for the party’s annual western South Dakota fundraiser, which featured socializing, speeches and auctions benefitting the state party.
Harrison was the headliner. He chaired the Democratic National Committee from 2021 until earlier this year. Previously, he served as the first Black chairperson of the South Carolina Democratic Party and worked as an aide to U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn. Harrison also founded the Dirt Road Democrats political action committee, which works to engage rural voters, and he hosts a podcast called “At Our Table” that features conversations with guests about the nation’s challenges and hopes.
In his Saturday night speech, Harrison highlighted Uhre-Balk’s success. Last year, she became the first Democrat in 18 years to win a seat in her legislative district. According to her, if she wins again, she’ll be the first Democrat in 30 years to win two consecutive races in the district.

Harrison said the party needs more candidates to follow her lead and ignore the naysayers.
“She didn’t listen to them,” Harrison said. “She listened to all of you, and she stood up and she spoke out and she won.”
The prescription for more results like that, according to Harrison, includes a focus on recruitment.
“Do not leave any seat in South Dakota uncontested in 2026,” he said. “Not one.”
Democrats have a start toward that goal with declared candidates for offices including U.S. Senate, U.S. House and secretary of state. But their only declared candidate for governor so far is a 20-year-old college student, and they face a challenge recruiting candidates in legislative districts that lacked Democrats on the ballot last year.
Fundraising, meanwhile, has been a bright spot. The state party’s reports to the Federal Election Commission showed $341,000 of income from January through August. A July fundraiser in eastern South Dakota featuring Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz drew a crowd of about 1,000 people. 
The same period’s reports from the South Dakota Republican Party, which has undergone staff turnover including a new chairman in February, showed $41,000 of income.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Museum of Art displays rare portraits of enslaved people,"Sophie Bates, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/mississippi-museum-art-rare-portraits-enslaved-people/,The only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi are on display at the Mississippi Museum of Art.,"With powerfully haunting eyes and an enigmatic expression, “Portrait of Frederick,” an image of an enslaved man painted circa 1840, stares out at visitors of the Mississippi Museum of Art.
A little further into the museum is Delia, a Black woman dressed in red and wearing a headscarf who bears a similarly unknowable expression. The pair of portraits are the only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi.
Now, for the first time, they are on display together for the public to see.
“I was mesmerized by the painting,” museum visitor Staci Williams said. “The colors, the expression. His humanity seemed to jump off of the page.”
The portraits evoke questions about who Frederick and Delia were, why they were painted and what went through their minds as their faces were captured stroke by stroke for generations to see.
“We don’t know, for example, if either of these people had the choice to sit for the portrait. We don’t know if they had the choice of what they were wearing when they were painted,” said Betsy Bradley, the Laurie Hearin McRee director of the museum. “They certainly weren’t allowed to own their own portrait.”
The museum bought “Portrait of Frederick” in partnership with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The museums will pass the portrait back and forth, each displaying it for several years at a time.
Bradley said purchasing the portrait brought up complicated feelings. Until emancipation freed him, Frederick was considered property. Now, more than 150 years later, his portrait is property, bought and sold to the highest bidder.
“If it enables us to have important conversations with each other about the human cost of slavery and why it mustn’t ever happen again, then having it in a public place can be meaningful,” Bradley said.
Since the 1860s, “Portrait of Frederick” has been displayed at Longwood, an antebellum mansion in Natchez, Mississippi, that belonged to the family of his enslavers. There, Frederick’s likeness was used to whitewash history.
According to research by the Neal Auction Company, which sold the painting to the Mississippi Museum of Art, tour guides in the 1970s informed the public that Frederick had grown up alongside his enslaver Haller Nutt, and the two were best friends. They claimed Nutt freed Frederick and referred to him by the belittling moniker “Uncle Frederick.”
In reality, Frederick oversaw other slaves on the plantation. He collected data on field production, analyzed growing conditions and acted as a manager. His role was important, and he and his family may have received better living conditions as a result.
Frederick was about 70 when the Civil War ended. He took the surname Baker and became ordained. Prior to emancipation, Black people were not allowed to marry. Frederick conducted weddings for at least 69 couples after it became legal.

Less is known about Delia. Her portrait was painted between 1840 and 1849. She appears to be sewing, which leads some to believe she worked inside her enslavers’ home. Delia’s portrait was kept by the descendants of her enslavers until the Mississippi Museum of Art bought it 2019.
Both portraits are unique in that Frederick and Delia are the sole subjects of the works. Oftentimes, Black people were painted alongside white people, likely as a way of underscoring the white person’s wealth.
Frederick is dressed in regal garb — something he likely would not have worn in his everyday role on the plantation. Both are depicted in a three-quarters composition, which was used for dignified and important subjects.
Upon looking at “Portrait of Frederick,” Williams said she felt a surprising mixture of pride and sadness.
“I wonder about what he’s thinking,” Williams mused. “He doesn’t seem to give anything away.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25154934/AP25256728817578.jpg,,,2025-09-28 09:56:31.964701

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — The Veterans Affairs Healthcare System this week celebrated the completion of a $16 million, 24,000-square-foot renovation of a medical surgical unit at the White River Junction VA Medical Center.
The upgrade aims to provide accessible, modern health care for veterans, and make “the actual experience of being in the hospital as pleasant as possible,“ said Dr. Brett Rusch, the executive director of the White River Junction location.
While the unit, which covers the second floor of its building, previously looked and felt like a “40-year-old dormitory,” it now is a “state-of-the-art medical unit,” Rusch said.

Except for trauma, open heart surgery or open skull surgery, staff on the floor provide most types of specialty medical and surgical treatment, Rusch said. The facility performs an average of around 1,700 to 1,800 surgical cases per year, spokesperson Katherine Tang said in an email.
Beginning in December 2023, the Colchester-based Engelberth Construction company took the building “down to (the) studs,” optimizing square footage to maximize beds while creating space for movement around the unit, Rusch said.

As part of the renovation, the number of total beds in the unit decreased from about 42 to 37, Greg Auch, nurse manager of the medical surgical unit, said.
“Sacrificing a few beds, to reach the 37 beds now, allows us to break things apart to single rooms and a couple double-occupancy just to create a better experience,” Auch said.
The increased space also allows patients to receive more of their care within their rooms.

For example, there is space for in-room chest X-rays and bedside cardiograms, Auch said. Additionally physical therapy and fold-out couches for family members are moving into rooms, Rusch said.
Each individual room now also has its own temperature controls, Auch said.
Four nurse stations are now distributed across the floor to be as close to veterans as possible, in contrast to being centralized in two centers as they previously were, Rusch said.
Additionally, ceiling lifts that carry patients and could previously only go the length of certain rooms can now maneuver across the entirety of each room and into bathrooms, VA interior designer Kaitie Gillespie said.
Throughout the nearly two-year project, the facility was able to keep beds operational by working on one half at a time, Rusch said. Half of the beds moved downstairs during the construction, which was originally office space, Tang said.
The first half opened about six months ago, Rusch said.
The unit will fully open for patients in about two weeks, Gillespie said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zachary Pratt: Vote no to Rutland City’s $3.9 million tax bond.","Dear Editor,


It is irresponsible for Rutland City to ask its voters to approve a $3.9 million tax increment financing bond at a time when the future of healthcare and other economic factors are unknown. Watching the Senate Finance Committee questioning the Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. earlier this month makes me believe that Vermonters are being put in harm’s way by his leadership as the “Big Beautiful Bill” strips Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
Open enrollment for health coverage in Vermont runs yearly from November 1 to January 15, so for me to vote to approve a $3.9 million project is unthinkable, especially when healthcare benefit cuts, increased prices of homes and automobiles, and tariff increases on other types of products are all yet to come.
Additionally, Rutland City is undergoing a comprehensive property tax reappraisal to update property taxes to bring the home assessments in line with market values that have risen in recent years. It is wrong to ask city residents to vote yes on a bond before all of these are known.

Despite another flood hitting in early July 2024, which again damaged parts of the trail, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail quietly opened last year to bikers looking to travel its full 93 miles.

This story by Patrick Bilow and Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Sept. 25, 2025.
After a long day of pedaling from Swanton to Morristown on the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, Paul Arthur of Vail, Colorado, didn’t have to look far for a quiet place to lay his head.
As the sun set over the Lamoille River, Arthur had pitched his tent on a soft patch of grass just steps away from the trail he’d been traveling. His bike, mounted with bags bursting at the seams with gear, was propped up by a strong stick, and Arthur was basking in the last sliver of sunlight available to him.
He’d found what he was looking for after dropping his son off at college a few days prior — something smooth and flat to pedal and reflect. The river murmured as it moved, and Arthur hadn’t seen another rider in hours.
“This is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had,” Arthur, 68, said. “Vermont is a biker’s paradise. I can’t believe no one else is out here right now.”After repeated floods waylaid its completion, towns are starting to see the full impact of a complete Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, which is attracting locals and out-of-town visitors like Arthur alike. Some ride and others walk or run. They come for day trips, launching from several different trailheads in Lamoille County, or they travel straight through Vermont, from New York to New Hampshire, stopping in towns along the way for provisions, repairs and libations.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
Data from counters installed by the Vermont Agency of Transportation that monitored traffic on the rail trail for the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025 shows that, if trends continue apace, that most stops on the trail are set to see usership far in excess of 2024, which department spokesperson Amy Tatko said reflected last year’s flooding-related closures.
The data also shows how the locally connected portion of the trail that runs through Lamoille County has helped develop ridership in those towns. Morrisville is clearly the most trafficked hub along the trail, while Cambridge, Johnson and Wolcott are also among the most popular access points, as towns like Fairfield have made inroads in the first half of this year.
Every town has benefited from a dry summer, as cyclists were able to travel unimpeded between Swanton and St. Johnsbury on the 93-mile former railway and one of the longest rail trails in New England, passing through five counties and 18 towns, including five Lamoille County towns along the way. Such a season has been a long time coming, even while a 17-mile Lamoille County portion of the trail has been open since 2016.
In 2023, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — who helped secure millions in federal funding to get the rail trail started in the 2000s — and Gov. Phil Scott — who has boosted the project and advocated for annual funding to maintain the trail — were set to walk portions of the trail in mid-July of that year as the complete version of the trail, decades in the making, was set to be unveiled.
But the flood of July 2023 hit just days before the big ribbon cutting, severely damaging portions of the rail trail and causing millions in damages in towns like Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville, Wolcott, Greensboro and Hardwick.
Despite another flood hitting in early July 2024, which again damaged parts of the trail, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail quietly opened last year to bikers looking to travel its full 93 miles.
Yva Rose, who operates Johnson-based Lamoille Valley Bike Tours with her husband Jim, has been keeping her own data of rail trail usership. Since 2016, she has seen the number of users steadily increase. In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the surge in outdoor recreation interest gave usership another big boost. The Roses’ plan to provide planning support, shuttle rides and bike rentals to riders along the full-length of the trail was torpedoed in 2023, which pushed potential riders to have cold feet even before the anniversary floods in 2024.
But the relatively dry summer this year has been a bounce-back season for the trail, with usership of the trail by her metrics having “quadrupled,” driven largely by a sector of outdoor enthusiasts that seek out the rail trail experience. Many towns along the trail have seen the cultural and commercial benefits already, even as they try to better position themselves to capitalize on their proximity to this economic engine of recreational tourism.
“There’s a community, a very large community, out there that spends their summers exploring rail trails,” Rose said. “Having our rail trail be 93 miles now and complete, without any flooding, has drawn a huge increase in rail trail tourism.”

Tranquility
Elona McNeil, 13, Shelburne
My funny little friend
appearing at my door,
day in and day out,
to say hello to me.
So intelligent
yet so silly,
chasing after fallen leaves and blades of grass.
Lying on the doormat
waiting for me to appear,
and sometimes,
when I do show up,
you stay sprawled right in front of the door,
unwilling to move,
saying,
Go around me –
you have other doors,
because you’re so comfortable.
The white fur on your stomach exposed as you roll around,
hooking your claws in the mat,
scratching,
pulling,
tugging,
brushing up against me,
wandering around the porch,
rubbing up against the box of chalk…
guarding our front porch
against what?
Only you really know,
pacing and nuzzling,
sitting and staring,
claiming this place as your own,
claiming me as your own.
You are my equal.
Sometimes I don’t understand you,
but most times
I just feel contentment and tranquility,
living in the moment, maybe,
having moved on from the past
and not having to worry about the future,
as the dappled sunlight between the leaves shines on your face,
as you close your eyes…
You never really sleep;
you’re just resting,
basking in the sunlight,
sleepy and calm after an exhausting day.
You know how to live –
can you teach the rest of us?

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Speaker Jason White wants citizens to be able to vote, but not on ‘school choice’",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/jason-white-school-choice-ballot/,Column: Speaker Jason White apparently does not want people to vote on whether public funds should be spent on private schools.,"House Speaker Jason White says he wants to restore the initiative process to allow citizens to place issues on the ballot.
But at the same time, White apparently does not want people to vote on the important issue of whether the state should expand its so-called “school choice” initiatives, which would provide more public funds to private schools.
His positions on two of what he calls his legislative priorities — restoring the initiative process to allow citizens to vote and expanding school choice options — seem to be incompatible.
White, the Republican House Speaker from West, has established a special committee to look at restoring the ballot initiative process, which allows voters to bypass the will of lawmakers and gather signatures to place issues directly on the ballot.
The state Supreme Court ruled Mississippi’s initiative process void in 2021 because it required a designated number of signatures be gathered from five U.S. House districts to place an issue on the ballot. The Supreme Court pointed out the state has had only four districts since 2000, thus the initiative process was invalid, even though other entities in state government are based on the five congressional districts.
Lawmakers vowed to fix the problem and quickly restore the initiative process. They still haven’t, and there’s no sign of any real movement to seek an agreement.
White has said he believes restoring the ballot initiative is important. But apparently he does not want school choice to be placed on the ballot for a vote of the citizens.
The speaker also has formed a special committee to look at expanding Mississippi school choice. The committee is expected to make recommendations before the start of the 2026 legislative session in January.
Though it may seem logical to do so, the committee does not seem interested in recommending a proposal be placed on the ballot to amend the Mississippi Constitution to repeal language that states explicitly that public funds cannot be provided to private schools.
Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution reads in part: “nor shall any funds be appropriated toward the support of any sectarian school, or to any school that at the time of receiving such appropriation is not conducted as a free school.”
That language is stunningly clear and concise, especially compared to some of the convoluted legalese often found in historical governing documents.
Multiple states have language in their constitutions prohibiting public funds from being spent on religious or sectarian schools. The courts have struck down that language, saying religious schools could not be discriminated against. But only the South Carolina Constitution has language similar to Mississippi’s restricting public funds from being spent on any private school — religious or non-religious.
If White and his special committee were serious about expanding the state’s school choice programs, they would start with amending Section 208. That could be done by the Legislature approving the proposal by a two-thirds vote of each chamber and then placing it on the ballot for voters to approve or reject.
Therein is the problem for the pro-voucher, school choice crowd. They know they cannot garner that two-thirds vote in both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature, and furthermore they cannot convince the public to pass such a proposal.
If they thought they could, they already would have placed such a proposal before the Legislature.
Instead, if the Legislature ever passes a proposal expanding school choice to private schools, they are counting on the Mississippi Supreme Court ignoring the plain language of the state constitution and ruling that public funds can be spent on private schools.
Of course, another option would be for the Legislature to finally restore the initiative process in Mississippi and allow voters to place a proposal on the ballot to repeal Section 208 language banning public funds from being spent on private schools.
But that is not likely to happen even if the Legislature restores the ballot initiative, which is also not likely to happen.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31115625/3X0A0245.jpg,,,2025-09-28 07:56:57.728551

As drought intensifies, depleting water levels are forcing towns to conserve water, harming aquatic ecosystems, and impacting recreational activities

In Berlin, an elder care facility that serves about 150 people saw all of its wells go dry. Now the town — which is getting 50% less water from its own wells — has to jury-rig a system to make sure Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center stays up and running. 
“I run a fire hose over to their storage tanks,” said Craig Pelletier, the town’s public works supervisor. 
Berlin isn’t alone. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, almost 94% of Vermont is in a severe drought, while almost 24% of the state is in an extreme drought, with Orange County, Windsor County and Rutland County being the most impacted.

Though many residents hoped recent rain would provide relief, any solace will be piecemeal. Rainfall throughout the week of Sept. 21 is “mostly going to be a drop in the bucket,” said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
After Sept. 28, warm temperatures accompanied with a high pressure system are expected to exacerbate the drought, Haynes said. 
One effect of climate change is that it often leads to a “swing between extremes,” Haynes said. In 2023, Vermont had its wettest summer on record, while this year’s summer has been extremely dry — a huge change in just a matter of two years, he said. 
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
With scientists predicting that drought will persist in the coming weeks, Vermonters say low water levels around the state are prompting towns to conserve water, affecting aquatic ecosystems, and creating barriers to recreation.
‘It’s just that bad, I guess’ 
In Berlin, one of the town’s four industrial-size wells recently went dry, Pelletier said. He estimates that the town’s overall water production is down by about 50%, he said.
The significant decline in production prompted Pelletier to issue a water conservation notice last week. The town issued the mandatory notice to its approximately 115 connected users, most of which are commercial businesses, Pelletier said. 
“This wasn’t a ‘pretty please’ thing. It was kind of, we need to do this to get through this drought together,” Pelletier said, referring to the notice.

Pelletier is working with state officials and well-drilling companies to see if the town can find a stopgap fix and reach some untapped aquifers underground to keep everyone up and running. 
“They’re drilled really deep. You know, they’re supposed to have plenty of storage — and it’s just that bad, I guess,” Pelletier said. 
Until then, he said, the town is carefully threading the needle. 
Neighboring city Montpelier issued a similar conservation notice on Sept. 18 after water levels in Berlin Pond, the city’s primary water source, dipped below the threshold for conservation. The city asked businesses and residents to cut back on water use and be mindful of when they’re turning on their taps. 
Another Washington County town, Plainfield, issued a conservation notice on Sept. 16. The town gets the majority of its water supply from a number of springs nearby, but those springs haven’t been able to meet the town’s demand in recent months, said Tristan MacGregor-Stewart, the town’s chief water system operator. 
Luckily, the town has a number of backup wells that it’s begun to draw from periodically since August. But pumping water from the wells is more expensive, MacGregor-Stewart said. The notice is a preliminary measure, to start conserving before the town has a big problem, he said.
One of Lunenburg’s fire districts is also under a water conservation notice. “Our water resources are depleted and the daily usage of customers needs to drop immediately,” said the town’s notice from Buddy Ball, the chief water systems operator.  
Since Aug. 22, the state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Ben Montross, with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of those reports, 77% represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well, and 20% represent drilled wells.
Residents in Orange County, in the driest part of the state, submitted the most reports, making up 21% of all reported shortages. 
At least five water systems across the state have also reported using alternate sources of water, according to Stephanie Brackin, a spokesperson for the Agency of Natural Resources. Those neighborhoods range in location from Pownal to Newbury. 
It’s possible that more towns and cities are operating under water conservation notices, but municipalities aren’t required to alert state officials when they issue the local warnings, Brackin said. 
In Corinth, an Orange County town that was one of the first in Vermont to see extreme drought conditions, residents are suffering.

People who live in town have been going to the town hall for water because their wells have gone dry, said Martha Brough, the town’s clerk. Margaret Loftus, who owns a farm in town, said she’s heard of people showering in local schools. 
Low water levels 
While sources of drinking water are drying up around Vermont, lakes, rivers, and streams have also been drastically impacted.
“A number of them are recording their lowest value on record,” state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux said. 
Vermont is experiencing at least five types of droughts at once, according to Dupigny-Giroux. A meteorological drought, driven by scarce precipitation, has dried out soil and led to agricultural drought. As conditions worsened, lakes, rivers and streams were hit by a hydrological drought, while the impacts on food production and prices pushed the state into a socioeconomic drought.
“A lot of the impacts that we’re seeing were exacerbated by how quickly the summer drought kicked off, which is a flash drought,” Dupigny-Giroux said. The flash drought — a rapid onset drought that deteriorates quickly — began between June and July but then ramped up in August, she added. 
Although Vermont has experienced droughts in the past, what’s unusual this time, Dupigny-Giroux said, is that the state has been experiencing a flash drought coupled with the hydrological drought since last year. 
“I spent most of my life in and around Lake Champlain ever since I was a kid, and I really have not seen water levels like this before,” said Julie Silverman, Lake Champlain lakekeeper with the Conservation Law Foundation. 
During her monitoring activities in the lake, Silverman said she was struggling to paddle to Law Island in Lake Champlain due to the lower water level. “People are actually able to walk to islands and other parts of Lake Champlain that they’ve never really had access to before by foot,” she said.
The fluctuations the lake has experienced between floods and extreme drought impact the entire ecosystem, Silverman said. “These are really dramatic extremes that put a tremendous amount of stress on animals as well as plants.”
“The lake is so low that we’ve lost a lot of shallow water habitat,” said Jason Stockwell, director of the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Laboratory at the University of Vermont. “The decrease in water level will affect the availability of such habitat for young fish to find food to eat and also to hide from predators.”
As the water level decreases, and the water temperature rises, different species are forced to share a shrinking band of livable habitat, with surface waters too warm and low-oxygen areas at the bottom of the lake expanding, according to Stockwell. 
The phenomenon intensifies competition among species, Stockwell said, leaving fish such as rainbow smelt, which would normally be in cold waters at the bottom of the lake, more vulnerable to predators and exposing spawning sites to anglers, wind storms and waves.
According to Dupigny-Giroux, the state climatologist, collecting data on drought impacts can help determine if Vermont is also going through an ecological drought, in which the landscape changes and cannot be reverted to what it once was. If some streams become permanently dry or some species leave and don’t come back next year, for example, the state would have experienced an ecological drought.
For this reason, Vermont officials encourage people to report drought impacts they notice across the state. 
“Reporting impacts, reporting any observations are so critical for us to be able to piece together all of the parts of this jigsaw,” state climatologist Dupigny-Giroux said.

Limits to recreation
While Vermont’s water bodies run low, Vermonters are seeing their aquatic activities limited around the state. 
In Burlington, “several weeks ago, we actually started to move boats that were in more shallow areas,” said Robert Peterson, the city’s Parks, Recreation and Waterfront’s marina manager.
Peterson said they had to move 10 or 12 boats from Perkins Pier to the Burlington Boathouse Marina, which is deeper, and pull some boats at the Boathouse Marina further back into the water or move them to deeper slips. 
“We’ve certainly had low lake levels before, but just not to this extent and not this early,” he said.
Joe Tyson, state parks regional manager for the Northwest region of Vermont, said park staff have been contacting people with reservations at the park to inform them that, with water levels so low, it may be challenging to access the parks by boat or launch a boat from there, especially with motor boats. 
“At Grand Isle State Park and Burton Island State Park, we proactively reached out to folks to let them know that it’s going to look different this year than it has in the past,” Tyson said.
Victoria Edwards-White, coach of the rowing team at the University of Vermont, said the team generally heads to Lake Champlain from the Lamoille River, but lately they have been facing some challenges due to the low water levels. While the boats used by the athletes aren’t very deep, the coaches drive boats with outboard motors that go deeper into the water, which are needed to reach the athletes in case there are any problems. 
“We’re getting to the point where, if we don’t see any rain in the next few weeks, we are at risk of not being able to operate at all,” Edwards-White said, adding that a lower water level would risk damaging their equipment. 
With low water levels, weeds and reeds are getting stuck in the oars and the engines, Edwards-White said, and the team hasn’t been able to access part of the river because of that.
On other bodies of water around the state, anglers are feeling the impacts of low water levels on their local fishing spots. 
Nick Mahood, who oversees the fly-fishing program at the Woodstock Inn & Resort, said his guides usually lead groups on fishing trips into the Ottauquechee River, the White River and smaller tributaries near Woodstock. But this year’s low water levels have completely changed the game. 
“The water levels are so low, we’ve had to pretty much completely stop any sort of small stream creek fishing for brook trout or native wild trout. That’s been really challenging,” Mahood said. 
His guides no longer consider smaller rivers suitable for fishing, and the program hasn’t been able to fish the Ottauquechee River in the last five or six weeks, Mahood said. 
Fishing for trout is usually a big part of the inn’s program, Mahood said. But when water 
runs low, its temperature rises faster, even in large rivers. 
Trout don’t do well in water above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and this year, water temps surpassed that marker early in the summer, leaving anglers to fish mostly smallmouth bass in the White River, he said. 
Northeast of Mahood is Bob Shannon, who owns the Fly Rod Shop in Stowe, a business that also takes anglers out on guided trips. In the fall, he mostly books trips to fish brook trout on mountain streams. Usually he takes groups out to Miller Brook, Ranch Brook, Notch Brook and Gold Brook — but this year those streams are so low there isn’t enough water to fish in them.
Shannon has adapted by mostly taking groups to ponds and lakes nearby, but sometimes that isn’t the trip more experienced anglers want — and he’s seen it affect his business. 
“Most of our fly fishing clients would rather fish in moving water on, you know, a beautiful fall foliage stream,” Shannon said.

Rising costs have defined the past six years for Dayna DePalma.
It wasn’t something she thought much about growing up in New Jersey with parents who both worked good jobs, who lived in a beautiful house. But in 2019, while in rehabilitation recovering from a drug addiction, she found out she was pregnant with her daughter. As a single mom, she moved back in with her parents and eventually started working at her child’s day care just so she could get the 50 percent discount that made it affordable. After six months, she left that job for a better one and now works in logistics.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network. 

But it wasn’t until this month, after months of looking for a place to live, that she was finally able to rent her own apartment. Her daughter just started kindergarten. DePalma has been sober for six years.
“Just being a single mom, it’s really hard to have a savings in general. I feel like I live paycheck to paycheck just with basic needs supporting her and myself,” said DePalma, 28.
Costs only keep creeping up, and she’s not sure what comes next. Saving enough to make the move was several years of work. DePalma has no savings, nothing squirreled away for retirement. Homeownership feels like a farfetched dream.
“I just feel like it’s going to be impossible to be able to own a home,” she said. “My anxiety levels have been through the roof regarding money.”
That’s a familiar story for most women these days, not just DePalma. The rising cost of living is squeezing women much more than men, and they report more concern about how they’re going to pay their bills, according to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll.
In every category surveyed — groceries, housing, child care, medical bills and retirement — women are more likely to say they are worried about covering those expenses. About 67% of women said they are worried about the cost of housing, compared with 60 percent of men. More than two-thirds of women are worried about the cost of groceries, while just over half of men are. Among parents, 52% of women are stressed about the cost of child care; 45% of men said the same.
SurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.

In recent months, prices for most necessities have again been rising, and changes from the Trump administration could make affordability more out of reach: Last month saw the largest rise in food prices in nearly three years; costs are up 29 percent from the start of the pandemic. Upcoming cuts to SNAP, the food stamps program, will make accessing benefits that lower that burden even harder. And housing costs, though they are starting to level out from their post-pandemic peak in 2022, are still outpacing inflation. Rising tariffs, which took effect last month, are only expected to worsen both.
The cost of child care is also outpacing inflation, averaging $13,128 annually in 2024, a 29 percent increase from 2020. And medical bills are soon expected to increase for those on Medicaid — the lowest-income Americans — and especially women and children after Congress cut more than $1 trillion from the program over the next decade.
On retirement, a spending package that passed Congress this year will provide a tax break to Americans 65 and older, but it will also make the Social Security trust insolvent by 2032, meaning retired women — the majority of Social Security beneficiaries — could see cuts to their incomes in the coming years.
If Americans are worried, it’s easy to see why. It’s also no mystery why women may be worried even more: Women make the majority of consumer purchases for their families and face rising grocery costs head on. Those costs are going to make it harder to pay for other needs, like rent; women are more likely to be renters, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be spending over a third of their earnings on housing alone.
If they’re parents of young kids, their other big line-item expense is probably child care, which for those with two or more children now exceeds the cost of the average rent or mortgage in most states. And if child care falls through, women are the ones most likely to have to leave work to stitch together care or leave the labor force altogether. Perhaps they’re missing work because their child is sick. Women are more likely to shoulder health care expenses for kids because they are primary caregivers, while also themselves facing higher health care costs on average because they go to the doctor more frequently for things like prenatal and reproductive care. After all of that is tallied up, what is left for retirement? Thanks to historic inequality, about 30% less than men.
What to know about the Classic Learning Test, the conservative alternative to the ACT 

“The shift in who does all the bill paying over the last generation — it’s not just that women do the shopping, they are also frequently the ones handling the mortgage check, paying the credit card bills, definitely looking at the after care bills or the child care bills,” said Mike Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.
And while men tend to view the economy more individualistically, women are making decisions across the whole family’s bank account, Madowitz said, while also taking the kids to the doctor and drawing up the grocery list.
“It’s both like women are in fact the accounting department and the manufacturing floor,” he said.
That view into household finances has made it so, historically, women have consistently felt worse about the economy than men. Because they tend to have fewer earnings and more caregiving responsibilities outside the home, they feel the impact of higher costs first.
Women of color feel it most of all.
In the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll, Latinas, especially, consistently reported higher rates of worry than any other group across nearly all categories except retirement. On groceries, 77% of Latinas reported feeling worried about growing costs, compared with 69% of White women. It was the same for child care (47% versus 28%), housing (77% versus 63%), and medical bills (73% versus 69%).
Black women also had far higher rates than their White counterparts, especially when it came to food and housing costs. Since early this year, Black women’s unemployment rate has been rising far quicker than for other groups, from 5.1% in March to 6.7% in August. It’s currently at its highest rate in four years.
Now, the arrival of higher tariffs on most countries is adding a new stressor to the mix that is already showing up in the inflation data.
“There are things like groceries where we know it’s gonna show up really fast and that’s obviously stressful because you’re seeing it right away, and also you’re seeing it right away in places where it’s not particularly easy to cut your spending,” Madowitz said. “But then there’s all this stuff where it’s not showing up right away, and on some level that also produces anxiety because you’re like, ‘Well, I know this is coming.’”
That feeling of uncertainty has been hanging over Nicole Taetsch and her family of four in New Jersey. Taetsch has her own consulting business focused on marketing and business development, and her husband works with real estate investment properties. They have a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old and make a pretty good living, “and still, it’s tight,” she said.
“Everything post-pandemic has gone up, and then the uncertainty of everything: Costs have never really come down, then tariffs have only added to it. There’s all sorts of different pressures,” said Taetsch, 43.
If they had another child “what would we do?” Taetsch said. “There is nowhere to move in our area. We couldn’t buy anything here.”
Even recently, as she did the kids’ fall shopping at Old Navy, she noticed those prices had increased. The same is true at the grocery store. Taetsch hosts a podcast on parents and politics, and her most recent episode discussed exorbitant grocery prices for healthy food items. It was inspired by a LinkedIn post from food importer Greg Santollo about a bowl of cut fruit at Whole Foods with a $35 price tag.
She and her husband, Taetsch said, “are just very cognizant of the fact that prices are going up, there is absolutely no social safety net, the government isn’t making any policies to help the average American, they are only making it harder through taking away people’s health care, not doing anything to improve our health system, not doing anything to invest in our schools or public education or child care — the things that parents need.”
Taetsch grew up with a single mother and feels like “there is no way that, today, the lifestyle of a single mom raising two kids is anywhere near how my mom was able to raise us.”
For women of her generation, she said, “I feel like the cards are so broadly stacked against us.”

Health security means that we get care that’s effective, competent, quick, and kind—with no more than tiny co-payments and no worry about medical debt. To redeem the promise of plastic insurance cards, health security requires having enough good doctors, dentists, nurses, hospitals, and other caregivers where we need them.   
That doesn’t make health security for all easy to win—just easier than housing, education and job training, global warming, personal and national security, decent living standards, or the other huge challenges we face. Because we already spend enough on health care to get the job done.  
Unfortunately, we won’t get even one step closer to affordable health security for all by nibbling around the edges of the problem. That includes following the well-intentioned but deeply flawed recommendations that the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Sarah Iselin, set out in a recent CommonWealth Beacon commentary.  
Her proposed remedies are modest. Even so, they are not likely to be implemented. If they were, they would do little good because they don’t attack—or even identify—the causes of high costs, weak access, and caregiver shortages. How can a problem be successfully treated if it isn’t correctly diagnosed?  
Blue Cross’s imaginary world 
Iselin asserts that “Our state has a chance to make big changes in our health care system right now—the kind of transformation that can only come about in a crisis.”  
But who in our state will take that chance? Most politicians mean well but none yet face strong political pressure to fix health care. Our governor wasn’t elected because she knew a lot about health care. Our legislative leadership knows less—apart from a few terrific committee chairs.  And the Health Policy Commission’s two new members are the head of the state hospital association and a drug company executive, each an informed insider who seeks not transformation but simply higher revenue for their sector.  
Many citizens and caregivers are suffering already, but their crisis hasn’t translated into political pressure for serious change.    
When it comes to lobbying in Massachusetts, it’s no surprise that health insurers, hospitals, and others in health care are eight of the top 12 spenders, as reported earlier this year.   
Iselin claims that “We have an excellent track record in our state of collaboration between health plans, clinicians, business, labor, and policymakers.” Sure, but that happy harmony has been lubricated by ever more money each year for business as usual. The throats of that harmonious chorus will go dry after the last remaining dollar is pumped out of the financial aquifer.  
State government has for decades refused to put its arms around health care and understand our cost or access or caregiver problems—or their causes. It did pass a law in 2012 requiring an assessment of needed hospitals and other caregivers, but then simply walked away from implementing that law. So state government still doesn’t know which hospitals are needed, or how many doctors we need or even have. And it has refused to forge the financial and legal tools to sustain needed caregivers. 
Still, it’s encouraging that so many smart and knowledgeable and dedicated people already work in health care in state government and elsewhere. They will be able to help fix our health care, once the people at the top face political pressure to get serious.  
For now, though, we have good reason to worry. Many insured people couldn’t afford out-of-pocket costs of needed care before the cuts from Trump’s big tax and spending bill. About a dozen million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage owing to the budget bill. Up to another dozen million could lose Affordable Care Act coverage if Congress refuses to extend Biden’s extra subsidies, which expire in December.  
Most Massachusetts hospitals are already losing money. Many nursing homes are in bad financial shape. Many people—even with insurance through the job—can’t find a family doctor who takes new patients.  Or afford high deductibles and co-pays and co-insurance.

Bad as this is, it isn’t the crisis. It’s the storm clouds and heavy rain that precede the hurricane. The health care crisis is probably a few years away—when Congress does something drastic—like freezing all federal health spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies.   
Why might Congress do that? Because it will face a massive federal budget crisis—one fueled by international tensions, reckless tax cuts, a $2 trillion deficit in good economic times, discord between two dysfunctional political parties, and the many competing demands for public dollars.   
That very real crisis could politically galvanize health care reform, but sudden pressure for change will be worthless without advance preparation.   
The remedies advanced today don’t help us prepare.   
Iselin bemoans higher costs for medical care and medications, and the high share of our citizens who delay care owing to its cost.  
One of her proposed remedies is greater reliance on value-based payment. This is tied to rewarding health outcomes, not volumes of care. Both notions have been wildly oversold. They simply haven’t saved any serious money, as both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have finally admitted.  
One big reason value-based payment doesn’t work is that payers find it very hard to devise trustworthy ways to measure the value of doctors’, hospitals’, and other caregivers’ services. Especially since the caregivers control the evidence and can game the payment method if they wish. Financially incentivizing caregivers to pursue “value” induces them to think more and more intensely about ways to maximize their own incomes and less about us as patients. For-profit Medicare Advantage plans respond the same way.   
More important, high volumes of care aren’t America’s problem. Doctor visits here are only 60 percent of the average across all rich democracies, and hospital admissions are 80 percent of that average. 
Care volumes are low here partly because high out-of-pocket payments deter many of us from seeking care. But the high out-of-pocket costs have been fostered by federal and state policies that try to turn American patients into kamikaze pilots in the war against high health care costs.  
Relying on patients—the least powerful and least informed group in the health care universe—to shop wisely for health care is a sick joke. It’s wrong to rely on suppressing access to care as a main cost control technique. Doing so manifests public and private payers’ unseriousness about cost control. And their stunted empathy for people who can’t afford high out-of-pocket costs.   
Another proposed remedy is finally enforcing the state’s “benchmark” for spending increases. In 2012, the Legislature created the Health Policy Commission and charged it with setting a yearly benchmark for the percentage rise in health care spending. But the HPC’s statutory authority is feeble. It took years, after the fact, to even try to recoup heavy overspending by Mass General Brigham. With health care spending increases widely disseminated, enforcing the benchmark on dozens of hospitals and others would be an administrative and legal nightmare.  
Other proposals call for a medication affordability board, hospital price controls, shifting surgery to allegedly cheaper ambulatory surgery centers, greater emphasis on primary care, and finding ways to ensure that for-profit groups like Steward play nicely.  
Yes, negotiating affordable drug prices is a good idea. But do individual states have the willingness, the buying power, or the political support to leverage lower prices?   
Even federal action on drug prices has been feeble. It took two decades for Congress to require Medicare to negotiate prices for its 10 costliest drugs. But the resulting prices remain almost triple the Western European average. There’s still little political will to take on the drug makers.   
Only one state has acted effectively to rein in hospital spending. Step by step, over five decades, Maryland has established a small, uniquely powerful and experienced state agency to set adequate budgets for all needed hospitals.   
This requires learning which hospitals and which services are actually needed, and how much it should cost to efficiently deliver care. Politically, the Maryland arrangement was possible partly because hospital trustees—who cared about their hospitals but also about costs of health insurance—controlled the state hospital association. A few other states have been taking baby steps to follow Maryland, but Trump may stop them in their tracks.   
Also, in response to Maryland’s success in slowing hospital spending, considerable care has been shifted from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers. This doesn’t save money—it simply sorts the dollars into different boxes. Worse, ambulatory surgical centers have very high profits and underserve Medicaid patients. The lesson? Individual reforms must be coordinated.   
Primary care? It’s been like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does anything real about it. A big reason is that no one is accountable for making sure we have enough primary caregivers to serve all 7 million Massachusetts residents. Not Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, or other payers. Not medical schools. Not teaching hospitals that train residents. And not state government.   
Sadly, reforming for-profit hospitals or insurance companies simply isn’t possible. The problem isn’t Steward, its deleterious and disgraced former CEO, or private equity. Focusing on them is like the French army preparing to fight the last war. Complete market failure in health care means we can’t trust greedy profit-seeking to give us the innovation, efficiency, and cost-cutting—or the provision of needed and effective care—that real markets would deliver.  
The real world 
US health spending this year will be $5.6 trillion. That’s six times defense spending and triple all education spending. In Massachusetts, health care spending this year will total about $140 billion, or roughly $20,000 per person—about one-third above the US average.   
This should be enough to pay for the care that works for all of us who need it. Most of the world’s other rich democracies have worked this out. We can, too.  
Massachusetts and US health care have become financially addicted to more money each year to finance business as usual. The grave health care crisis—the actual hurricane—will arrive when the new money stops flowing. The freeze in federal health spending, mentioned earlier, is one of the possible sparks for explosive changes. It will threaten caregiver bankruptcies and much greater suppression of needed patient care.

The first response by hospitals, doctors, and drug makers to the freeze will be to try to raise the prices they get from insurance companies, money supplied by the employers who pay insurers’ bills. But with family premiums already over $30,000 yearly, private employers and also state and local governments will say no to higher prices.  
Their second response, discussed shortly, will be very different.   
But why isn’t current spending enough? Because up to half of what we spend on health care is wasted.  

On care that isn’t effective or isn’t needed or has enormous cost but low clinical value. Or that lacks continuity and coordination owing to shortages of primary care and the loss of lower-cost community hospitals.  


On vast paperwork that stems from deep mistrust between payers and caregivers—and the resulting upcoding, downcoding, prior authorization denials, and litigation—and from the astonishing complexity of coverage and error-prone bill-paying.  


On very high prices for needed drugs, devices, and other things. (Americans are 4 percent of the world’s people but we give the world’s drug makers 50 percent of their worldwide revenue, and an even greater share of their profits. That’s not affordable and it’s not right.)  


And on outright theft. Complex payment methods, market thinking that applauds greed, belief that health care theft is a victimless crime, and short-handed prosecutors who negotiate no-contest plea deals all help sustain theft.  

Overall, we waste so much because we rely on free market competition to contain cost and on government action to regulate our way out of problems. Neither works. 
The conclusion that competitive free market simply does not work in health care is a pragmatic assessment, not an ideological one. (I think free markets are a good idea, where they actually exist.) Not one of the seven requirements for a genuine free market is—or can be—remotely well-satisfied in health care. 
Market failure means that we don’t get innovation, lower costs, or the care we need and pay for. But we waste time and effort by trying to shoehorn size-12 health care realities to fit into size-5 market fantasies. This is a bipartisan problem. Both Democrats and Republicans talk about anti-trust suits against hospital mergers but neither does much. Both parties push caregivers to post prices on web sites, but the numbers are generally useless—and unused.   
At the same time, government’s energies have been diverted into trying to regulate to clean up the many messes that the failed market leaves in its wake. It acts like the worker with the wheelbarrow and shovel who follows the circus parade.  
Steward is the latest acute example. The state’s cost benchmarks’ failure to limit spending is a chronic example. Low-quality nursing home care is a third. Widely disseminated theft in health care is a fourth. Governments write regulations that are hard to enforce; failed enforcement undermines confidence in competent public action.  
Failed markets and incompetent government mean health care anarchy. Anarchy means weak accountability for financial coverage, for actual access to care, for cost control, or for securing the right doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers in the right places.  It means more waste.   
In a few years, the explosive health care financial crisis will provide the energy to blast loose most of the vast dollars now wasted inside Massachusetts and US health care.  
Hospitals and doctors will support reform when their alternative is bankruptcy or deep income cuts. Patients will support reforms that guarantee needed care that’s affordable. Employers will finally recognize that they can’t rein in their own costs. Politicians will try to catch up.  
Real reform requires crafting an alternative to markets that can’t work. And to traditional reactive government regulations that can’t work. We can look at the arrangements prevailing in most of the world’s other rich democracies—nations that successfully, though not perfectly, protect all their people, give more health care, spend one-half as much per person, and live longer.  
Here’s what that would mean.  
First, an insurance card for each person, one requiring no more than nominal out-of-pocket payments. Back the cards financially with the dollars already available. Give up on trying to save money by suppressing patients’ use of care by making out-of-pocket burdens unaffordable or doctor appointments unavailable or waits for mental health care intolerable.  
Second, redeem the plastic cards clinically with adequately financed budgets for needed hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other institutions. And for the right types and numbers of doctors in the right places. If we want more primary care doctors, we have a choice between drafting them and paying them more money.  Much more.  And slashing their paperwork.  And supporting them with NPs and PAs.   
This means careful public action to identify needed caregivers and pay them enough to finance efficient delivery of needed care. It also means paying caregivers in ways that allow us to trust them to spend our huge but finite dollars effectively, equitably, and frugally. That’s a tall order.    
Third, a yearly cap on national and state-level health care spending. This means putting health care on a budget. Making that work requires caregivers and managers who are accountable for spending our vast—but inevitably finite—health care dollars as well as possible.  
The first three actions require strategic legislation. Making the big strategic decisions well can set health care on a path to affordable self-regulation by caregivers. If governments don’t make the big decisions well, they will be pressured to continue to make lots of micro regulatory decisions. It will remain impossible to make those competently or efficiently. Or enforce them. 
Fourth, recognize that free markets and government regulatory micro-management don’t and can’t work in health care. The resulting anarchy means that no one is accountable for ensuring good care for all people, containing cost, or sustaining the right caregivers in the right places.   
To assure good and affordable care for all—to balance access and cost—there’s probably only one workable alternative to failed markets and incompetent government regulatory micro-management.  
It turns out that individual doctors’ decisions about how to diagnose and treat us control and spend almost 90 cents on the health care dollar. So we have to put our money in doctors’ hands under arrangements that allow us to trust them to spend it as well as possible—to do as much clinical and human good as possible.  
That means paying doctors well, but in financially neutral ways that don’t incentivize them to give unneeded care or deny valuable care. This means seeing physicians as fiduciaries, not MBAs. It probably means salaries (large ones) for doctors working in hospitals and other trustworthy arrangements for doctors working in ambulatory care.  
Greater physician altruism will help. So will a simple bargain: Doctors, we will get rid of almost all of your payment-related paperwork, including prior authorizations. And we will even end medical malpractice suits—and craft alternative ways to compensate patients who are harmed by bad care. But only if you agree to serve as clinical and financial fiduciaries for your patients.  
Doctors’ better decisions will weed out clinical waste. Especially when supported by hospital trustees and managers who also act as fiduciaries—helping doctors get as much clinical value as possible for patients out of finite hospital budgets. That will require making better evidence available on effective and affordable ways to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries.   
Paying doctors and hospitals in simple and trustworthy ways will slash administrative waste.  
Capping drug prices or negotiating deals with drug makers will make needed meds affordable for all. This can be matched with big dollar prizes for competing labs that develop effective and safe new meds.   
Simplifying the flows of money inside health care will cut opportunities for theft. Health care theft and fraud are not impulsive. They are calculated. Catching more crooks and imposing serious jail time on those who steal will help deter further crime. Capping spending will make it clear to everyone that theft kills. This will spur more whistle-blowers to come forward.  
Fifth, since market failure means that profit-seeking isn’t legitimate, outlaw for-profit caregivers and insurance companies. Buy up owners’ equity by floating 20-year bonds.  
You may not think a crisis is coming. You might be right.  
US and Massachusetts health care might continue to muddle through. Some hospitals will close; others will lay off nurses and other workers. And cut money-losing services. ER delays will grow. Access to care will get a little worse each year. More paperwork and private insurance companies’ denial of care will drive us a little crazier each year, but only slowly. AI will automate the job of making us crazy. Employers will boost out-of-pocket costs to slow premium increases. Anxious not to upset organized lobbies of caregivers, drug makers, and insurance companies, politicians will continue to do as little as possible.  
But you might be wrong. If a grave crisis does arrive, and political pressure for reform becomes irresistible, will we know what to do? It’s a bad idea to defer sewing parachutes until the plane’s engine has stopped.   


The best insurance policy we could craft for our health care is to begin right now to plan what to do if the crisis hits. Crisis means an opportunity to fix all that’s wrong with our health care. But only if we prepare in detail.   
Broad and deep planning is vital because health care itself is so complicated—and because reform is even more complicated. Also because it’s essential to minimize disruption to patient care and to conserve the valuable and intricately organized networks of caregivers we rely on.   
The premium for this policy would cost a few million dollars yearly for five years or so. That  money would establish a state government office to plan the responses to the many challenges that a health care financial crisis will present. Some of the jobs entail preparing state government to make essential strategic decisions. Others involve orienting doctors and other caregivers toward balancing the financial and clinical books—the pressures to care for all citizens of Massachusetts effectively, equitably, and efficiently—with the vast but finite dollars available.   
Some of the individual jobs include:  

Sustaining the flow of revenue into health care, to protect access and to keep all needed hospitals, doctors, dentists, nursing homes, hospices, and other caregivers out of bankruptcy 


Assessing the current availability and locations of care—from hospitals, doctors, dentists, nurses, nursing homes, mental health, and other caregivers 


Learning how much hospital inpatient capacity we require, where it should be located, and how much it should cost to deliver efficiently  


Learning which types of doctors we need, how many, and in which locations 


Designing ways to fill gaps between current capacity and need—and of implementing those designs  


Starting today to rapidly rebuild primary care capacity—and also dental care capacity 


Learning how to cap cost of care at affordable levels—and securing revenue commensurate with that cost  


Crafting ways to pay doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers that are financially neutral, adequate to keep caregivers reasonably happy, simple to administer, and affordable to all of us to provide the money 


Promoting an altruistic and fiduciary outlook for all caregivers 


Designing a financial-clinical-political deal with caregivers, one that lifts today’s oppressive and time-consuming administrative burdens, pays them well, and liberates them to spend our health care dollars to do as much good as possible 


Addressing prescription drug prices and incentivizing development of valuable new meds 


Assuring worried patients that health care is working for them—since pathology is remorseless but resources are always finite, how to build citizens’ trust—such that the only reason one patient doesn’t get certain costly care is to liberate doctors’ time and hospitals’ nurses and dollars to deliver care that’s more valuable?  


Developing ways to identify and respond to problems and complaints from patients, caregivers, payers, and politicians 


Integrating the pieces so they fit by developing timelines for each activity and coordinating revenue, budgets and other caregiver payments, access and equity and quality of care.  

Affordable high-quality health care for all of us should be the easiest aim to attain because we already spend enough.  Nations that are realistic about health care—and that don’t tolerate wasting one-half of their health care spending—cope continuously with the challenges a deep crisis would mean. It’s time Massachusetts state government took those challenges seriously. It’s time to begin to organize the efforts of the many competent and smart people working in and out of state government to plan to respond to the crisis—if, or when, it hits.  
The alternative will be to accept that a health care crisis would hit us like a Pearl Harbor attack—unready to respond.   
Preparing to fix health care will help us win a victory for compassion and competence—one that will liberate money and attention to address the tougher problems that confront us.

A twisting path brought them to Connecticut more than a year later.,"On a cold, rainy day in late March, Evgenia Natsevych lifted her daughter Angelina, allowing the 7-year-old to peer through the waiting room window of a New Haven dentist’s office. 
“I want her to see the ocean,” she said, pointing to Long Island Sound. “We had the sea in Odesa.”
Angelina began experiencing tooth pain in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Three years later, her mother was finally able to get her care through Connecticut’s Medicaid insurance, known as HUSKY.
Caught in the whirlwinds of war and migration, Evgenia and her family are just a few of the 120,000 Ukrainians who arrived in the U.S. through a program known as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U). Created under the Biden administration, the program has been paused indefinitely by the Trump administration. As the intensity of the war escalates, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Ukrainians to seek refuge in the U.S.
Evgenia’s story, like many Ukrainians’, transcends borders. The war opened up her family photo album and scattered its pages. 

As Evgenia resettled in the U.S. on October 2022 with her husband and children, her mother and stepbrother resettled in Germany. Her father and stepfather remained in Ukraine. Her father is his ill wife’s caregiver, and her stepfather is a hospital director and a first responder to airstrikes.
It was in the midst of these changes and the uncertainty of their family’s residency status that Evgenia and her husband Vitalii finally began to find steadiness — in Connecticut.

War at home
In the early morning of Feb. 24, 2022, Evgenia was sleeping with her 3-year-old daughter Emma in their home in Odesa, Ukraine, when she was woken by a loud noise. She called her husband Vitalii out of bed. 
“It’s a firework,” she recalled him saying. Moments later, as they stood in front of their bedroom window, a missile flew by, close enough for them to discern its shape. Then the sky went white with another bang. 
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun.
Later that morning, Evgenia’s phone glowed with messages pouring in from the WhatsApp group chat for Angelina’s nursery.
“Is anyone going to day care today?” asked one mom. “We are operating as usual,” answered a teacher.
Evgenia and Vitalii’s home had no basement, and it was near a military station, which they worried would be a target. They decided to leave. 
“I had one hour to pack everything. So I got my plant, I got my camera or something like that, a few books, and that’s it,” Evgenia said. “We didn’t realize what’s going on. We thought we would just take some stuff, but it’s not forever.”
It was one of many moments, at the time and since, that residents of Odesa have had to weigh whether to leave. And it wasn’t a clear call.
Just a few evenings earlier, Evgenia’s university friend Julia Abramova had come over for dinner. They prepared burgers, and Julia had sat between Evgenia’s two daughters, little Emma and Angelina, whom she adored. 
As Evgenia was considering her options, Julia was panicking, pacing around her apartment. After a few hours of indecision, she began throwing things into a suitcase. “It’s hard when you can see all of your life in one luggage,” Julia said. 
Ultimately, Julia decided to remain in Odesa — and she’s still there, living through the frequent drone strikes that have only grown in number. She and Evgenia haven’t seen each other since that evening they made dinner together.

Evgenia documented her thoughts on social media as she and her family made the drive north to her inlaws’ house. “We took the most valuable thing — the children,” she said in one Instagram story. “There are many other pieces of life left.” 
Those physical remnants of memories can’t be replaced: her late grandmother’s strawberry plants and tulips, which Evgenia had planted in her home. Or the piano, which she had had shipped across the country after her grandmother’s death so her daughters could learn to play. 
“What if I don’t come back,” she continued in the social media story. “Or there’s nowhere to come back to.”
The family thought they’d be safer with Vitalii’s parents, farther north in Ukraine. But soon after they arrived, they discovered they were just over a dozen miles from the Kyiv battle lines, where Russian and Ukrainian forces were fighting for control of the capital. By the third day of the invasion, the house shook and sirens wailed. 
The three generations took shelter in the unfinished basement, where Evgenia continued to work remotely as a marketing manager. Then she began to develop sensitivity to certain odors. She was pregnant. 
“Oh god,” she thought. “Why now?”
Evgenia’s belly grew as Russia’s military bombed hospitals and maternity wards. She read reports of pregnant women moved to hospital basements and didn’t want to become one of them.
“I decided that I have to go out (of the country) somewhere, at least to have my baby. Because I was scared.” She left for Chemnitz, Germany, with her mother and daughters, while Vitalii stayed in Ukraine. He had no choice. 
Ukraine had already mobilized its men of fighting age, but fathers of more than two young children were exempt. This baby would be the couple’s third.
After two months of trying, Vitalii was able to leave and join his family in Germany. They then connected with a university professor in Arkansas named Ken Olree, whose church helped a number of Ukrainian families through the U4U program.

At the edge
Like countless other Ukrainians, Evgenia and her family thought their stay in the U.S. would be temporary. 
“I was living the wonderful life in the house of my dreams,” said Evgenia of her life in Ukraine. Three years later, the war shows no signs of stopping, and Russia continues to pummel Ukraine with ever-increasing drone attacks.
The third most populated city in Ukraine, Odesa is a seaside city known for its architectural heritage and its inhabitants’ distinct sense of humor. Its historic downtown is peppered with lush parks, coffee shops with bustling terraces, boutiques and rooftop restaurants with unobstructed views of the Black Sea.
The city’s proximity to Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014, and the magnitude of its port make it a target for Russian airstrikes. While Ukraine’s air attack alert system can successfully warn civilians of an impending air strike in places like Kyiv, drones can cross the distance to Odesa fast enough to leave little to no time for cover.
The port, near the city’s historic center, was where Evgenia and her husband dated, got engaged, and were married soon afterwards. Today, it is closed to the public, partially burned and damaged by strikes.
Evgenia had bathed in the sea’s calm waters during her first pregnancy and later would take leisurely walks by the water on workday lunch breaks. “It felt like the sea was where we drew strength,” she said.
Just months after her family’s emigration, sea mines, both Russian and Ukrainian, forced Odesa to close its coast for some time after a few swimmers died from explosions.

The seashore was also where Evgenia would go on walks with Julia, who works for a maritime employment agency, and where they had partied as single women, dancing at the upscale Ibiza Beach Club. 
Strolling through Odesa’s Lanzheron Beach on a warm Sunday in June, Julia thought back to the time she had spent there with her friend, tears gliding down her cheeks as she recalled when they’d lived mere minutes apart. Life in Odesa had changed so much since that time.
Now the days were punctuated with air alerts signaling potential incoming drones. Even a visit to the mall could turn into a waiting game, as it had for some the day before. Shoppers filed down escalators to the basement-level parking garage, standing among cars as they waited for threats to subside.
A robotic voice announced the all-clear through the mall’s loudspeakers, and shoppers quickly lined back up outside stores, waiting for the security gates to lift. Outside, people resumed evening walks and happy hour chats on restaurant terraces. It was like pressing “play” on a paused movie.
Just hours later, a Russian drone struck a high rise across town. Alarms wailed on and off into the early morning.

But the new day brought renewed energy. Children splashed around in the waves, the water’s green tint a reminder of ecological warfare resulting in algae. Elderly women chatted on lawn chairs, basking in the sun. A man sporting a bandage down his arm pushed a wounded friend through the sand, his leg propped up on his wheelchair. 
The whiplash between the mental toll of Russia’s psychological warfare and residents’ grasp on a ‘normal’ life was palpable.
Russia’s invasion, Julia said, made her “realize that life will never be the same.” By the time she had calmed down that first morning, the military activity made it too risky to leave the city. She decided to stay in Ukraine to be near her parents, even as her friends left the country one by one.
The last time Julia saw Evgenia, in early 2022, she had two cheery toddlers. “I don’t really know when I will feel or touch them, hug them,” Julia said in June. Now, Angelina is 7, Emma is 5, and Olivia, whom Julia never met, is 2. Evgenia is 38.

Resettling
Olree picked up the family in October 2022 and welcomed them into an extra home he owned in Searcy, Ark. The house was furnished, there were clothes for them, and the refrigerator was stocked with food. 
“He’s our angel,” said Evgenia.
She gave birth to their third child, baby Olivia, soon after, and Vitalii began looking for a job. (Under the U4U program, Ukrainians received humanitarian parole, which automatically grants the right to apply for work authorization.)
The main challenge in his job search was the language barrier because his English wasn’t strong. Back in Ukraine, Vitalii had worked for the same food company for 10 years, where he was a regional manager, and had dozens of people reporting to him. In Arkansas, he settled for changing tires.
Believing they would soon return to Ukraine, the family left Arkansas after three months to see more of the country before returning home. For more than a year, they lived in Florida — alternating between a rental home belonging to an acquaintance of Evgenia’s in Delray Beach and a hotel when the rental was occupied. 
They were still hoping for the war to subside so they could return to Odesa. “We see the war getting worse. And I tell my husband we have to stay,” Evgenia said.
 
 

Evgenia cleaned houses to earn an income. 
After a few months, the couple began looking for a home to rent more permanently. But they didn’t have a credit score, among other standard requirements for housing applicants in the U.S.
“I was trying to find something. They said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no.’” Eventually, one Russian-American couple responded to her husband’s Facebook message on a housing post in Lake Worth, Fla. 
“She says, ‘We don’t need any documents. We want to help you.’ So we got house, we rented it. So the house was very bad, very bad with cockroaches, with mice, rats. Living in a zoo, but it was a house. I was not homeless anymore. At least I was happy.”
The house was a small source of relief from the violence and heartbreak they were following from afar. “I missed home. I was watching all (the) Ukrainian news, every bomb, every house, and they killed a lot of kids. I was crying all the time,” Evgenia said.
To stay afloat, the couple picked up odd jobs, with Evgenia eventually cooking in a daycare and Vitalii working as a handyman. Then one day, a job listing in Evgenia’s Telegram app stood out. It was for a sales manager at a food company in Connecticut.
“I immediately call them and say, I have my husband. He was a top manager in Ukraine. He’s very good in sales. He knows everything. Your company will benefit.”
Vitalii got the job, and the family of five moved to New Haven. It was February 2024, two years after Evgenia fled her homeland.

Stability in New England
In Connecticut, the family began to find their footing. 
They fulfilled their dream of purchasing an RV, which they found discounted on Facebook. That allowed them to make summer road trips to places like Hammonasset State Park and Cape Cod. “This would have been great when we were homeless,” said Evgenia, pointing to the camper parked in their backyard, near a small trampoline for the girls.
Their sun-drenched home in New Haven’s Amity neighborhood echoed with the girls’ joyful squeals as they chased each other. Their drawings, taped to the walls, brought life to the kitchen. Outside, a white picket fence.
Their living room was decorated with hints of their heritage, and a Ukrainian flag hung proudly in the window. Back in Ukraine, Evgenia said, “We didn’t need to think about identity. We just were there.”
Being removed from their homeland pushed Evgenia, Vitalii and their three children to seek out others in the diaspora. 
“We met a lot of Ukrainian people and Ukrainian Americans who were born here,” she said, “but they keep the traditions.” She began studying Ukrainian embroidery and architecture. “I understood that it’s important. I want to know it, and when I know it, I can share it with my kids.”
The eldest, Angelina, now speaks English, but her mother says she struggled through kindergarten and first grade. “I was sad about that, because I feel like she’s stressed all the time.” Her limited grasp on language impacted her confidence. “She didn’t understand English, and it was hard for her,” Evgenia said. “She’s good in math because math, you don’t need English for that.”
Beyond raising three daughters and working as a home aide for the elderly and people with autism, Evgenia took on the role of art director for an event organized by the New Haven Ukrainian American Humanitarian Aid Fund. Tapping into her past experience working at an art gallery, Evgenia named, priced, and categorized the pieces that will be sold at the Wounds to Wonders event on Oct. 26.

The event will take place in St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church, the same church where Angelina recently received her First Communion, and where the family attended events as some of New Haven’s newest community members. 
As the weather warmed up last summer, Evgenia began to take the girls on highly anticipated trips to beaches along the shoreline. On one excursion in mid-August, the girls splashed in Long Island Sound’s gentle waves. Later, they took turns on the swings and shrieked as they played with other children in Lighthouse Point Park’s splash pad in New Haven.
Summer was coming to a close, and so was their chapter in Connecticut.
On Sept. 9, the family made one more move, leaving New Haven for Duncan, South Carolina, where Vitalii took on a new role in his company. 
The plan was for Evgenia to stay back with her daughters for the academic year, as they had gotten off the wait list for their desired schools. But when Evgenia’s car was stolen in front of their home in August, she decided the family should stick together.
“I will always be grateful for Connecticut and for the people there, and I think [Connecticut] is the best,” Evgenia said. “I could get a counselor from CIRI or from IRIS, they’d help me,” she said, referring to two refugee resettlement organizations whose services made her feel supported during her move to Connecticut. Evgenia placed her children in IRIS’ summer program during their first summer in New Haven.

Both CIRI and IRIS have been forced to cut back on the services they offer following funding freezes by the Trump administration, and more recent refugees to Connecticut can no longer access the type of help that was available to Evgenia and her family.
The status of Ukrainians across the U.S. remains in limbo following the pause on the U4U program. And high-profile meetings between President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed to bring about a solution to the conflict. That has left Ukrainians at home and abroad in a holding pattern. 
Evgenia is taking life day by day, but amid the precarity of her family’s situation, she is certain of one thing: “Connecticut gave us jobs, insurance, school, and community,” she said. “Connecticut saved me.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Not long ago, I was haunting the alleys downtown and noting all the infrastructure you don’t see from the storefronts. The utility poles and power lines and electric meters reminded me of the work of R. Crumb, the underground cartoonist most famous for the anthropomorphic, sexually charged “Fritz the Cat” comics. It wasn’t an oversexed feline I was thinking about but Crumb’s urban drawings, especially “The History of America,” that render in painful detail the things we have trained ourselves not to see, such as the web of power lines strung from utility poles overhead.
One alley in the center of Emporia is packed with such infrastructure, including “One Way” and “Do Not Enter” signs and Dumpsters and pooled rainwater and about a billion feathers from the pigeons that make their homes in the nooks of the surrounding multi-story buildings. I don’t know why, but I find the feathers particularly repulsive. It’s not that there’s a particular problem in my hometown with the birds, not more than any other downtown, or that the alley is filthy or otherwise unclean. The feathers just get to me like some things get to others — like knife on glass or listening to the president trying to pronounce “acetaminophen.”
We all have something that makes us cringe.
I was thinking about these things that drive us individually or collectively to distraction, and it occurred to me the alley was a metaphor for our current political landscape. Behind the marquees of either party, past the storefronts jammed with tired slogans, past the back rooms where the real work is done, either with cigar-smoke influence or cold hard cash, there’s the alley of American political life. This is where the absurd and the unpredictable occur, the place where drunken shouting matches take place, the band smokes reefer and you notice all the hidden things that keep the whole show powered, except it isn’t electricity moving through those lines overhead.
The power that moves through our political high-tension wires is made of money and attention. The money is like volts and the attention is like current. You can’t have one without the other, at least not when there’s flow in the line. There’s nearly an unlimited supply of volts available, thanks to Citizens United, but the amperage is driven by how many eyeballs and ears are on a particular post or podcast or television program.
Right now, an incredible amount of wattage flows through our political infrastructure, enough to make your hair stand on end if you get too close to one of those lines. Say the wrong thing — which in some cases is simply stating a truth — and you might get zapped with a billion watts of blind outrage. Here in Kansas, MAGA toadies have called for the firings of state employees over social media posts. The First Amendment insulation has frayed under the stress to the point where a reasonable citizen might question how much, if any, speech is safe.
We’ve experienced strain on the system before, most recently in the 1960s, and we eventually strengthened the political infrastructure. Some of that super-duty equipment included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both were pillars of the modern civil rights movement. The former outlaws discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The latter prohibits racial discrimination in voting, including racial gerrymandering, but it has been gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court through the past 12 years.
We are now in territory that would have been unrecognizable to most Americans just a few years ago. Even though some of us could see it on the horizon, we have arrived in a new country with unexpected urgency, accompanied by political violence. The latest to die, of course, was a 31-year-old MAGA ally, shot Sept. 10 in Utah. Other political assassinations include a former Minnesota speaker of the house, a Democrat, and her husband, in June. These deaths are tragic. I will not attempt to describe the political beliefs of either Charlie Kirk or Melissa Hortman. No postmortem commentary should add or detract a whit of what they had to say in life.
When bullets silence speech, democracy is in grave peril. It was already in trouble, considering the rush to authoritarianism and the repeated stumbles of Democrats, but on this month an American tradition was made new again. Political violence is a habit we must break, or it will surely break us.
My earliest media memories are television coverage of assassinations in the 1960s. I felt the fear radiating from my parents and other adults as television beamed into our living rooms news of the assassinations of a president, a civil rights leader, and a presidential nominee. John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy. There were more. The killing of revolutionary Black separatist Malcolm X, the attempted assassination of presidential hopeful and white segregationist George Wallace, the executions of Mississippi Freedom Riders Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
We are at another turning point in American history at which we must ask: What now? How much more can we endure? Where is the country we once knew?
No matter our discomfort, we must not surrender to whatever heated inclination to mayhem may surge through us. No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, a violent response would power more violence. There’s been a lot of talk in the wake of the shooting earlier this month that political violence is never the answer. That, of course, is the only proper reaction. What also needs to be said is that retaliation for political violence is not the answer, either.
While the manhunt was still ongoing for the Kirk shooter, the president was quick to blame political enemies for the shooting. He declared Kirk a martyr and promised a national crackdown on political violence, including nonprofits and others he accuses of funding organizations that support it. Since that declaration, Trump suggested some broadcasters should have their licenses revoked for engaging in speech critical of his administration.
A TV talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel, was suspended by Disney-owned ABC for his remarks on the Kirk killing. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, had said Kimmel should be suspended and “we could do it the easy way or the hard way.” The threat of regulatory action was clear. Kimmel has since been reinstated by ABC to a surge in ratings, although the program was still boycotted by the Nexstar and Sinclair station groups, effectively removing Kimmel from about 20% of markets. In his returning monologue, Kimmel called the censorship threat by the FCC chair “un-American” while tearfully mourning the loss of Kirk as someone whose life was cut short.
Freedom of speech is among the foundational principles of the American experiment in democracy. It goes all the way back to before we were a nation, to when colonial printer John Peter Zenger’s newspapers were burned by the governor of New York in 1734. But the Kimmel case may be the most high-profile modern example since police raided a small-town newspaper two years ago — here in Kansas.
The Kimmel firing also appears to be a textbook case of censorship, when a government official (in this case, the president and his FCC chair) attempt to suppress speech based on content. This is prohibited by the First Amendment. From the president all the way down to your town council and school officials, the law is meant to restrain government actors from trampling your expression.
But as troubling as the government suppression of speech is, there’s a related stifling of expression we must now talk about. It’s self-censorship. If you’ve caught yourself thinking twice before sharing your political views with others, you’re suffering the chilling effect of political violence and the government’s retaliatory crackdown on dissent. You may not be suffering immediate effects, such as the loss of a job, but there is a cumulative risk, like secondhand smoke.
Back when I was a student journalist, I once had a piece of mine challenged at the last minute because a school official thought it was obscene. In those days I briefly drew a comic strip for the campus newspaper at a public university in Kansas. I was heavily influenced by Doonesbury and other, less mainstream comics, and it was the second or third installment of the strip. It involved somebody asking where the nearest bathroom was on campus and a communication major being unable to answer the question clearly. By the end of the strip, the character doing the asking was turning into a kind of human pretzel to keep it all in.
Not great stuff. Did I mention I was still a teenager?
But when the newspaper sent the pages to the printer on campus, a question arose. Somebody thought the strip was obscene. They imagined they saw an exposed private part in the drawing. A dean was alerted and I was summoned to the print shop. I never did see what the shop supervisor thought he saw. But I remember how uncomfortable it was to stand in a group of older adults — of authority figures — and try to explain there was no penis in the cartoon.
It didn’t matter, they said, they weren’t running it unless I changed it.
I was handed a grease pencil.
I didn’t know enough then to understand that even if I had drawn something a bit naughty, it wasn’t enough to qualify as obscene. If it had been obscene — and that is quite a high bar — it wouldn’t have been protected by the First Amendment. But it wasn’t that, it was just a sketch, a silly attempt by an aspiring cartoonist. I yielded to the pressure and used the grease pencil to change the offending part of the drawing on the page composite. The bowdlerization was completed using some black tape and an X-Acto knife.
I recall how I flushed with embarrassment.
Had I been in the campus newsroom, I might have had the courage to refuse. But I was across campus in the print shop, with angry authority figures telling me they couldn’t run my strip because it was improper. Afterward, I kept the incident to myself.
I was ashamed and desperately wished I’d never tried drawing a comic strip. I vowed never to do it again for publication, and I didn’t. I abandoned drawing comics forever as soon as I put the grease pencil down.
I censored myself.
It may have been one of the reasons I so desperately fought for the rights of my journalism students when I became a college publications adviser decades later. That old cartoon strip was something I’d tried to push out of my mind. I didn’t think I was angry about the incident at the time, just ashamed. Did I have any promise as a cartoonist? Probably not. But the next Art Spiegelman or Alison Bechdel may be thinking twice about putting thought to paper or pixels because of the Trump era attacks on free speech.
There is only one Kimmel, and his suspension and reinstatement has dominated the news. We are right to be concerned about the future of free expression in America, for journalists and cartoonists and late-night talk show hosts. But we should also be concerned about the chilling effect all of this has on the rest of us.
The most effective tool to silence dissent is not force, but shame.
If your views don’t match that of the current administration or its favored political movement, you may have had an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. I know I’ve had. You might think your views might be offensive to some of your friends and neighbors. I know mine are. Your cheeks might sometimes become flushed when trying to explain yourself. I’ve been there too.
But the thing is that disagreeing with somebody isn’t the same as wishing them harm. Neither is refusing to act with what government officials and influential others may regard as the proper deference. If they take offense at your rational and nonviolent opinion, the fault is theirs and not yours.
You may not think your opinion counts for much, that you don’t have anything to add, or that engaging in the sober debate over the deep issues that divide us is important. You might even feel that saying what you feel is right might be disrespectful. Or you might just want to tell a joke a draw a comic with a political bent. But it is all the kind of free and unfettered exchange a functioning democracy requires.
We’ve all felt so much political cringe and stepped-up outrage that our collective hair is standing on end.
But don’t let a bullet fired in Utah make you silence yourself. Speak out against political violence, always. But don’t allow others to make you so afraid of retribution, so deferential to power and authority, or so ashamed of your own beliefs that you stifle yourself.
In other words, Keep on Truckin’.

But here are a few tips for making your next ride frictionless.  These tips are mostly about riding Acela, but many hold true for slower Northeast Corridor trains.


What’s a NextGen Acela? These are the new trains built by Alstom, previously known as Avelia Liberty.  They hold 25% more passengers than the existing Acela trains and can, at least for 32 miles with fast, straight track in New Jersey, travel up to 160 mph compared to the old Acela’s 150 mph.
Just a few of the new trains are running so far but 26 are more on the way, replacing the older Acelas which will be retired.
Book early:  We booked our Acela tickets about two weeks in advance and scored senior fares (10% discount) of “only” $204 one way from Stamford to Washington D.C.  Waiting at the station to board I heard the ticket agent startle a younger passenger seeking a ticket to DC by quoting her the same-day walk-up fare of $402 one way.  A minute later the helpful agent said she could make the same trip a half-hour later (on the slower train) for half as much.
Reserved seats: Seats on all Acelas are now reserved.  But don’t trust the seating chart you’ll see online.  When we boarded the train we found our seats faced backwards (not in the direction of travel) and had no window.  But a helpful conductor found us better seats right on his phone.  Consult a third-party seating chart to make sure you get the seats you want.
If you want the Quiet Car, be aware there’s only one such car with 59 seats.  Otherwise you’ll be enjoying the “finance bro” across the aisle making deals enroute by phone.
Boarding advice: The cars on the NextGen Acela are much shorter than the regular trains, so position yourself carefully on the platform to minimize walking once the train arrives.  I noticed Amtrak staff at each station helping minimize “dwell time” for the train by getting passengers off and on as quickly as possible.
Use the Red Caps: If your train originates at your station, like our return from DC, get priority pre-boarding with the help of the Red Caps.  Avoiding the throngs queueing to board is worth a tip, even with reserved seats.
How’s the ride? In a word, spectacular.  All the Acelas run no faster than Metro-North in Connecticut, but south of New York City it’s a whole different railroad.  True to its promise our train hit 159 mph on the straightaways in New Jersey and the ride overall was very smooth, unlike the 25-year-old Amfleet cars or the 50-year-old Amfleet cars on the slower trains.
Service: Enroute the cabin cleaning staff came around to collect trash and Café Car items were available (credit cards only) from a cart moving between the cars.  The Café Car itself looked great with self-serve windows displaying the food items. But there are no tables to sit down, just some counters where you can perch and munch.  The food offerings were “premium” and priced accordingly.

The on-board Wi-Fi was spectacular… truly 5G.
On time? Like many Amtrak trains, even the super-Acela tends to run a few minutes late in Connecticut because of Metro-North traffic.  We departed about ten minutes late from Stamford but, because the schedule is padded, were on time out of Penn Station and arrived early in Washington D.C.
Is it worth trying?  Yes, at least once.  Amtrak has a lot riding on these new trainsets, so try one soon and you’ll see what the future will be like.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acela-Engineer-runwaygirlnetwork-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-28 04:57:22.305214

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Democratic presidential nominating process may not begin in Iowa during future presidential nominating cycles, but politician Rahm Emanuel told a crowd of 400 Iowans Saturday the state will play an important role for Democrats in 2026 and beyond.
“I want you guys to have some confidence,” Emanuel said. “People bet on winners, and Iowa is where winners are made.”
Emanuel, who has served as former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, a U.S. representative, former mayor of Chicago and U.S. ambassador to Japan, spoke at a fish-fry fundraiser for Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines. The longtime Democratic operative has not officially said whether he plans to run for president in the next election cycle — although he has made several comments indicating he is considering a run — and he did not bring up the future role of the Iowa Democratic caucuses in 2028 or beyond.
However, Emanuel did speak about his vision for national policies while answering questions on issues such as President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, Medicaid and education. Emanuel said he has spent more than 30 years trying to “unrig a system that is rigged” while working on issues such as gun regulation and health care access.
“I’m here to tell you, in confession, I’m done unrigging it – I’m going to rig it for the people that work hard and play by the rules,” Emanuel said.
Iowa lost its first-in-the-nation status beginning with the Democratic presidential nominating cycle in 2024 due to concerns with the reporting of results from the 2020 Democratic caucuses and Iowa’s use of the caucus process rather than primaries. While the Democratic National Committee is reconsidering its presidential nominating calendar for 2028, it currently seems unlikely that Iowa will regain its position.
This has not stopped Democrats like Emanuel, as well as other potential presidential hopefuls like U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg from visiting the state in 2025.
On Saturday, Emanuel also said he believes Democratic candidates are in a good position heading into the 2026 midterms, highlighting the state’s gubernatorial, U.S. Senate and state auditor races, as well as congressional races. Emanuel joked that “I don’t want to put on my old Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hat, but I see two (competitive seats) … Okay, I’m not going to tell you which two, but I see it” — likely referring to Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts, which have been rated by political forecasters as potential flips for Democrats.
He also brought up the victory of Iowa Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City, who won with 55% of the vote in an August special election against her Republican opponent Christopher Prosch for a seat formerly held by Republican Sen. Rocky De Witt of Lawton.
“I want the rest of America to know what Iowa’s doing, not the other way around,” Emanuel said. “You guys are leading the way. So, congratulations.”
Drey also spoke at the event, calling for Iowans who are upset with the GOP-led state and federal government to speak out, run for public office, and support Democratic candidates.
“Together we can do extraordinary things, but not if we are focused on playing nice and following the rules and waiting our turn,” Drey said. “So, this is our turn, and I would like for us to take it together.”
Bagniewski begins event with acknowledgement of DMPS superintendent arrest

Bagniewski began the event by making a statement about the detainment Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Roberts entered the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa and was not authorized to work in the country, in addition to being charged with illegally possessing weapons in 2020.
The DMPS school board placed Roberts on administrative leave during a special meeting Saturday. DMPS officials held a news conference Friday speaking about the incident, though they did not comment on the validity of DHS claims.
At the fundraising event, Bagniewski said his thoughts and prayers are with Roberts right now, as well as with teachers, parents and students across Des Moines. Bagniewski said after his son, Teddy, came home from school yesterday, he had a “hard conversation” about what occurred.
“Our community is grieving right now, and I hope we get to a better place on the other side of all this,” Bagniewski said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a statement earlier Saturday on the arrest where she spoke in support of enforcing immigration laws.
“The arrest on Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts was shocking, particularly his attempt to evade authorities, and the loaded gun, knife, and large sum of cash found in his vehicle,” Reynolds said in the statement. “The investigation is still underway, so I won’t comment on details of the case at this time. But I want to be clear: We are a nation of laws that must be enforced. Those who believe immigration laws are optional are dangerously wrong. When laws are ignored, or when people are led to believe there will be no consequences, our communities are at risk. Iowans won’t stand for that. We must enforce the law, every time, to protect our families and our future.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/emanuel.9.27.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-27 22:57:01.718909

(Undated photo courtesy of Arkansas Department of Corrections)After pushback from members of her own party, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Friday changed the date of the general election to fill the vacant District 26 Senate seat from November 2026 to June.
The new general election date still comes after the end of the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, giving rise to complaints from Republicans and Democrats that citizens of the district will be unrepresented in next springs legislative fiscal session
Republican candidate Ted Tritt of Paris posted on Facebook Saturday: “Any step to shorten the time our people go unrepresented is encouraging,” but the new date remains “unacceptable.”
Tritt is one of three Republicans who have announced their intent to run; the others are Brad Simon, also of Paris, and former state Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
The special election is being called to replace Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died Sept. 2. 
State law requires a special election be held not more than 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Tritt, Simon and Arkansas Democratic Party Chair, retired Army Col. Marcus Jones all criticized the election dates as unfair to residents of the district, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of a proposed 3,000-bed state prison in rural Franklin County supported by Sanders, and Simon and Tritt expressed concerns Friday that the area’s residents will be left without representation during likely discussions of prison funding in the fiscal session.

In her original and updated proclamations Friday, Sanders declared that holding the election within the 150-day window would be impractical and burdensome.
She originally set the special primary for the District 26 seat for March 3 and the general election for Nov. 3, 2026, dates which coincide with the state’s regular election schedule.
The revised election schedule kept the primary election on March 3, but moved the general election to June 9.
In a press release announcing the revised election dates, Sanders said that “after receiving feedback from the community and getting confirmation from election officials that a change while difficult is doable, I have decided to move up the general election date to expedite representation for the River Valley.”
Arkansas Democrats, in a Saturday press release, said Sanders is still “ignoring the law.”
“This is nothing but a bandaid to the serious bipartisan backlash she’s receiving, but she is still openly and scandalously defying Arkansas law,” Jones said in the release. “The Governor has a legal responsibility to fill this vacancy within 150 days, and the updated election date is still 130 days after that deadline.” 
“This general election date still leaves more than 85,000 Arkansans without representation in the Senate for 280 days: not only does that take away their say in the 2026 budget, but that means there is no one to reach out to when they need resources or assistance from Arkansas’s highest legislative body,” Jones said.
Tritt wrote on Facebook that “the reality remains: District 26 will still go through the spring fiscal session without a senator and clock over 250 days without representation. That’s well beyond what the law calls for, and far beyond what our families deserve.”
“Budgets will be written. Priorities will be set. Votes on the Franklin County prison project will be taken. Decisions will be made that affect our schools, our hospitals, our farms, and our jobs. And through all of it, the people of District 26 will not have a seat at the table,” he said.
Simon posted on Facebook Friday that letting the seat remain vacant for so long is “unconscionable, unacceptable, and unconstitutional.”

(Creative Commons CC0 1.0) A gunman shot and killed an employee at Eastern State Hospital early Saturday morning, according to the Spokane County sheriff’s office.
The suspect exchanged gunfire with police and was also pronounced dead on the scene, the sheriff’s office said. He was reportedly wearing tactical-type gear, and a rifle and handgun were found near him.
Eastern State Hospital is one of two state-run psychiatric hospitals for adults in Washington and is located in Medical Lake, Washington, west of Spokane.
“Preliminary information indicates that this armed suspect is believed to have been acting erratically in Medical Lake and possibly involved in three incidents that occurred in the same general time frame,” the sheriff’s office said.
These reports described a man making “wild statements,” including about aliens.
Firefighters responded to a brush fire around midnight and encountered a man yelling and acting aggressively. They requested police assistance, but the sheriff’s office said the man left the scene before deputies arrived.
Around 1:40 a.m., police received a call about a man with a rifle who entered a home and fired several shots as uninjured occupants hid.
About 15 minutes later, a caller reported the Eastern State Hospital employee had been shot in the hospital’s parking lot. The suspect took the employee’s radio and began transmitting messages over it about “an army coming,” police said.
“We grieve the tragic loss of life of an Eastern State Hospital employee who was murdered by an active shooter overnight at work,” Washington Federation of State Employees President Mike Yestramski said in a statement. “Senseless acts of violence like this have become an all too common reality these days.”

Tim Walz call a special legislative session to consider a ban on assault weapons.
The rally came more than a month after two children were killed and 21 other people injured, all of them children and senior citizens.
Brittany Haeg, whose six-year-old son David was injured in the shooting, urged lawmakers to act quickly and decisively. “I’m here to tell you as a Catholic, as a mother, as a human: prayers in place of action when you have the power to act are a betrayal of prayer itself.”

She described her experience testifying before a state Senate gun control working group, where she told lawmakers about her son’s injuries, “about the bullets that lacerated his spleen, about the shrapnel still scattered through his side, about the bullets that grazed his skull. Then I listened to other parents, to the doctors who saved David, to their anguish and their grief, to their fear.”
She then called out Republican Sen. Jeff How of Rockville.
“And then I listened to Sen. Howe tell me he couldn’t support a ban on assault rifles, or high capacity magazines,” she said, “because shooting guns with a 30-round magazine, like the one that nearly killed my son, is fun. Fun, he told us.”
Boos and hisses erupted from the crowd.
“Listen closely,” Haeg said, “Your silence is not neutral. Your silence is a choice.”

Republicans say an assault weapons ban is a violation of 2nd Amendment gun rights and won’t stop motivated killers from acquiring weapons.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spoke about the bittersweet feeling of dropping his children off for their first day of school, saying that his wife made note of where his daughter’s seat was in relationship to the windows and doors. “We are being robbed of our peace,” he said.
Tess Rada, whose 8-year-old daughter survived the shooting, spoke about the trauma of hearing the 116 shots inside of the church where her daughter prayed.
She read the names of children killed in recent school shootings in the United States, ending with Harper Moyski, 10, and Fletcher Merkel, 8. It took more than a minute to read the whole list.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)County election officials are required to accurately report when  voters’ mail-in ballots have been set aside because of disqualifying errors and allow their votes to be counted on provisional ballots, Pennsylvania’s highest court ruled.
The state Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision Friday upholds lower court rulings that Washington County election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots. 
This prevented voters from challenging the board’s decision to disqualify 259 vote-by-mail ballots or casting provisional ballots as a backup to ensure their votes were counted, the courts said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We must interpret the Election Code and its statutory procedures in a way that ‘favors the fundamental right to vote and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate,’” Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote for the majority, quoting the court’s 2020 decision resolving issues surrounding the then-new vote-by-mail law. 
“Reading the Code as allowing county boards to withhold readily available information from voters does not serve that goal,” Dougherty wrote.
Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center, which represented voters and voting rights advocates in the case, said the right to vote is fundamental and the foundation of the nation’s democracy.
“Yesterday’s decision is a win for voters. Boards of Election cannot segregate mail-in ballots with disqualifying envelope errors and then withhold that information. Voters should be afforded an opportunity to cast a provisional ballot if they make a paperwork mistake on their mail-in ballot envelope,” she said.  
The Republican Party of Pennsylvania, which filed the appeal along with the Republican National Committee, and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not respond to the Capital-Star’s requests for comment.
The decision stems from a decision by the Washington County Board of Elections days before the 2024 primary to rescind a policy of notifying voters about disqualifying errors on their ballot declarations such as missing signatures or dates. 
The policy allowed voters to correct errors, request a fresh mail-in ballot or vote provisionally at their polling places on Election Day.

Instead, elections office workers were instructed to stamp ballots with the date and time they were received and make a decision whether to set aside ballots with obvious disqualifying errors such as a missing signature or date. All ballots were also scanned into the state’s electronic voting system and recorded as “ballot received,” regardless of whether they were segregated for errors.
This prompted the system to automatically generate an email stating that the ballot had been received, and that if the “election office identifies an issue with your ballot envelopes that prevents the ballot from being counted, you may receive another notification.” Otherwise, the email stated, voters would not receive any further messages and would not be able to vote at their polling locations on Election Day.
It also caused the poll books at voting locations to indicate that a voter had cast a mail ballot, preventing those whose ballots were set aside from casting provisional ballots.
A group of seven disenfranchised voters backed by the Center for Coalfield Justice and the Washington Branch NAACP filed a challenge in July 2024, claiming the board’s new policy violated voters’ constitutional rights to due process of law. A Washington County judge ruled in their favor and a 2-1 Commonwealth Court panel affirmed the decision on appeal.
In his opinion for the Supreme Court majority, Dougherty said the RNC and Pennsylvania Republican Party’s arguments that the board of elections should be allowed to “hide the readily ascertainable status of electors’ mail-in ballots” would punish voters for common errors. He added that their positions are at odds with both the Election Code and the commonwealth’s longstanding practice and policy of protecting the right to vote.
While the courts have affirmed that the Election Code does not provide for voters to “cure” defective ballots, Dougherty scolded the Republican Party for characterizing voters who make minor mistakes as “noncompliant” and “fingerwagging” that the legislature has “forbidden do-overs.”
“But this case is not about do-overs. It is not about correcting a defective mail-in ballot return packet. It is not about a “second bite” at the proverbial apple, and it is not about double-voting,” Dougherty wrote. 
“It is about allowing a voter who made a mistake on a mail-in ballot return packet — the kind of mistake that will likely disqualify the ballot and invalidate the elector’s attempt to vote — to avail herself of the remaining “fail-safe” attempt to exercise her fundamental right: completing a provisional ballot on Election Day,” he wrote.

Dougherty added that in that case, the state voting system is designed to ensure that only the provisional ballot would be counted, or if the mail-in ballot is counted, then the provisional ballot is thrown away.
“In both scenarios, however, the only way the elector gets her single vote counted is to be given the easily accessible information that was intentionally withheld in this case,” he said.
Justice Kevin Brobson issued a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice David Wecht, in which he cited a fundamental disagreement with the majority on whether a mail-in ballot with missing signatures or dates is actually void and whether provisional voting is allowed. He also expressed concerns about a lack of consistency across the state in whether voters should be allowed to correct such errors. 
“Like existing county-by-county “notice and cure” practices, the Majority’s decision here provides another data point upon which electors can reasonably question whether our elections meet the promise of equality and uniformity guaranteed by our state charter,” Brobson said.
Justice Sallie Mundy issued a separate dissenting opinion in which she added her concerns about the fairness of the state electronic election system notifying voters their mail ballots are disqualified because providing an email is optional when registering to vote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7447-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-27 11:57:27.993073

The prize for investigative journalism came with $5,000 cash for Castro and an additional $2,500 for Rhode Island Current. Funding comes from the A-Mark Foundation.
The awards ceremony occurred on the second day of the NENPA conference at The Hotel Northampton in Northampton, Massachusetts. This year’s conference was jointly hosted by the New York Press Association, and A-Mark Prizes were given to three reporters in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. There were not enough entries for A-Mark Prizes from Maine and New Hampshire news outlets, according to the event program, although NENPA hopes to award A-Marks in these states next year. 
“The Prize will reward ambitious, well-researched reporting that may expose a wrong, hold powerful individuals accountable, or explore a complex problem, issue, or subject,” the prize application read. The judging panel for each state consisted of journalists, editors, journalism educators, and investigative reporters. 
Castro’s winning entry on the RIBridges data breach spanned reportage published from December to May, when the state’s public benefits systems was hacked and the data leaked online. Around 650,000 residents were affected, according to state officials. After the initial wave of reporting on the breach had subsided, Rhode Island Current coverage revealed that a state request for proposals posted months before the hack contained a system architecture diagram — a blueprint for possible intrusion. Castro notified officials and Rhode Island Current delayed publication until after the documents were taken down. 
Providence Journal writers Mark Reynolds and Jack Perry placed second and third, respectively, in Rhode Island’s batch of A-Mark prizes. 
Rhode Island Current content partner Connecticut Mirror won first and third place A-Mark prizes in its state.
At last year’s fall publishers conference in Providence, NENPA named Rhode Island Current the region’s Online News Publication of the Year. That competition was judged by New England readers. NENPA announced there is no Online News Publication award for 2025 because judges did not receive enough entries to consider.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed Gov. Larry Rhoden’s bill designed to help homeowners get relief from the high cost of paying property taxes. Don’t expect that to be the last word on the subject.
Dramatic increases in property taxes have given rise to some strident calls for change. Owner-occupied dwellings, in particular, have seen their property tax bills increase. While the Legislature is certainly listening to those complaints, as yet it is still struggling to find relief for property owners who say they are seeing the ability to keep living in their homes slipping away.
The property tax problems in South Dakota were neatly summed up during an educational panel at Dakotafest, as noted in a story in the Mitchell Republic. South Dakota Retailers Executive Director Nathan Sanderson said that when the subject is property tax relief, the state has three choices: shift the burden to another class of property, ask schools and counties to spend less, or find another funding source.
None of those solutions have many backers, though finding another funding source is part of the solution offered by Rhoden. He has proposed allowing counties to voluntarily impose a sales tax of up to half a percent with the funds to be used for relief of residential property taxes. This is a stopgap measure at best and sure to have its detractors in the Republican-controlled Legislature, because it calls for a new tax.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

Rhoden already has one property tax win, with the passage of a complex law designed to offer homeowners some relief. The new law, which took effect July 1, limits the increase in owner-occupied residential assessments to 3% countywide for five years; sets a five-year, 3% cap on the amount taxing districts and school capital outlay budgets can increase as a result of new construction; exempts some home improvements worth less than 40% of a home’s value from affecting assessments; and expands eligibility among disabled and elderly people for property tax assessment freeze programs, including an increase in the multi-person household income limit from $45,000 to $65,000, and an increase in the maximum value of an eligible home from $300,000 to $500,000.
While that legislation has many moving parts, it represents only a portion of a tax system that lawmakers were admonished to study by another Dakotafest panel member. Former state senator Mary Duvall said lawmakers should do their homework, learning about the state’s tax system so they know what they’re talking about and have the expertise to assess the impact of their legislation.
The need for expertise in how the system works can be seen in a proposed constitutional amendment offered by former legislator Julie Frye-Mueller, among others. That amendment has not yet been approved for circulation to gather signatures.
If approved by voters, the amendment would scrap property taxes and instead levy a $1.50 fee on transactions of $15 or more and a 10% fee on purchases of less than $15. These fees would be charged over and above the sales taxes that are already on the books.
The Legislative Research Council, which has to review all proposed constitutional amendments, said its passage would change everything as it relates to the funding of counties and schools. Passage of the amendment would also rely on the Legislature to design a way to collect the tax, establish a distribution formula and manage a new property tax replacement fund.
Those blank spots in the amendment will certainly ask voters to take plenty on faith if they were to vote for the new system. The next step in the process of approving the amendment for circulation is creating a fiscal impact statement which will show if the new tax, at a buck-and-a-half a purchase, could actually generate enough money to keep schools and counties afloat.
The proposed amendment shows the folly of trying to fix the state’s tax system in a piecemeal fashion. Like the 18 property tax bills in the 2025 legislative session or the dozens that will likely show up in 2026, they only go to show that there’s no one solution to revamping the system.
As Sanderson pointed out at Dakotafest, the Legislature has been “schizophrenic” lately when it comes to taxes, cutting the sales tax and considering elimination of the sales tax on groceries. Lawmakers do this, all the while proposing legislation that’s supposed to “fix” property taxes, often without including a way to replace the funding.
According to Sanderson, the Legislature has conducted summer studies of property taxes three times in the last five years. With summer winding down, let’s hope that this year’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force can decide on a way forward that makes sense for the state.
That may be a lot to hope for since past summer studies apparently haven’t alleviated the pressure felt by the state’s property taxpayers. The scope of these studies is too narrow. It would be best for the state to widen the study and take on all taxes, rather than just property taxes. A comprehensive study is needed because it’s obvious that a change in property taxes is likely to have ramifications for the state’s entire tax system.

Sen. Alex Padilla observed immigration court in San Diego this week in order to get a better understand of the issues that people face in proceedings. 


When Sen. Alex Padilla attended an immigration hearing at the federal courthouse in San Diego Wednesday, there were no confrontations with federal officials and no public arrests of people attending immigration check-ins. 
Instead, the visit revealed the confusion involved in legal proceedings conducted in multiple languages, over virtual platforms, amid a federal campaign of mass deportations.
Padilla, a member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Security, said he wanted to observe the issues that people face in immigration proceedings.
“In that capacity as part of our oversight responsibilities in the Senate I came to see firsthand what we’ve been hearing for months and months now,” he said at a press conference after the visit. “Not just the stops, the detentions, the arrests on the streets through this immigration enforcement activity by this administration, but even people who have been in the system coming in from periodic check-ins, trying to comply with the conditions of their status.”
In May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their hearings at San Diego Immigration Court and placed them in a process called expedited removal, as part of a nationwide effort to fast track deportations.
This month, a San Diego law firm challenged courthouse arrests in a lawsuit filed on behalf of two asylum seekers. The complaint argues that those arrests are unconstitutional and erode the integrity of the asylum process.
There were no such detentions on Wednesday, but Padilla said he wanted to make sure no one was arrested while complying with the immigration process.
“Whether people are quote unquote ‘playing by the rules,’ they should not be penalized for them,” he said. “This should not be a trap.” 
Padilla made headlines in June after he entered a Los Angeles press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and was tackled by her security officers and forcibly removed. 
Noem said he barged into the room and interrupted the event, but Padilla said he attended peacefully and properly identified himself. Videos of the incident illustrate the tension between President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration raids and California officials’ efforts to oversee enforcement action within the state.
On Wednesday, Padilla highlighted his low-key appearance at the San Diego court hearing.
“I sat quietly in the back,” he said. “I want to make sure I emphasize that, because I was not disrupting, not recording, was not interfering with the procedures, and saw multiple people who were scheduled to be before judges today in person. The judge was not in person. The judge was remote.”
While the judge’s appearance over video is legal, Padilla said, it can limit their ability to observe and communicate with defendants.
“When a judge is not present in person to be able to read body language, and is remote and virtual, that also is not ideal,” Padilla said, adding that immigration courts need more judges to handle the volume of cases generated through increased ICE enforcement.

The first defendant Wednesday was a young Haitian man. Although the Wednesday hearing was simply an intake procedure that did not cover the substance of his immigration status or case, it included multiple miscommunications.
Judge Olga Attia appeared on screen, introduced herself and learned that he needed a Creole interpreter. The interpreter also logged in remotely, but poor audio quality made it hard to follow the discussion.
Attia learned that the defendant had recently moved, so she ordered a recess while he completed a change of address form. 
While he filled that out, she called the second defendant, who confirmed that he spoke English and Bengali, but did not need an interpreter and did not have legal representation. It turned out that he too had recently changed his address and needed to fill out the form.
Shifting back to the Haitian man, Attia tried to establish the basic details of his residence, educational status and guardianship. But the attorney representing him said the client had been “unresponsive and uncooperative” and had not returned calls. Because of that, he and his co-counsel asked to withdraw from the case. The defendant said his phone wasn’t working, so he couldn’t receive his attorneys’ calls or messages.
“I guess if I share a couple of takeaways it’s in some ways the inefficiency of the process, whether it’s the need for additional access to counsel in person, or whether it’s the need for translation services,” Padilla said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425_Padilla-SD-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-27 10:59:00.898233

WILMINGTON — Sussex Central lined up in punt formation on their own side of the field trailing Salesianum by ten early in the third quarter. The Golden Knights appeared ready to punt the ball away after their first drive of the second half was halted by the Sallies defense. Instead, the snap went directly into the hands of senior William Harmon, shocking the Salesianum special teams unit.
Harmon flew down the right side of the field all the way to the Salesianum 24 yard line before he was taken down by a few Sallies defenders. The fake punt paid off a few plays later when senior quarterback Josiah Cannon connected with Harmon down the right sideline for a 20-yard score to draw within three points. That’s the closest the score would be the rest of the night.
Sallies scored 21 unanswered points following the Golden Knights’ successful third quarter drive defeating Sussex Central, 31-7, Friday night at Abessinio Stadium.
Sallies’ defense was strong throughout the evening holding a powerful Golden Knight offense under 30 points for the first time this season. Sallies was able to slow down Sussex Central’s mighty running game and force a couple of turnovers to earn their first regular season victory over Sussex Central since 2021.
One of those turnovers was a pick six from junior Jett Healy that he ran back 28-yards for his second of two touchdowns in the game. Healy’s pick six occurred with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter capping off a streak of three straight drives ending with Salaesianum points.
Healy’s first touchdown of the game started the scoring streak.
Following the Golden Knights score at the start of the third quarter, Sallies began their drive at their own 38 yard line. Salesianum marched down the field all the way to the Sussex two yard line where Healy took a wildcat snap into the endzone to restore Sallies’ lead to ten.
EstherVell Cotton followed Healy on Sallies next offensive possession, running outside the right tackle for a 23-yard score in the fourth quarter. Senior Devin Hasan was the only other Sallies player to record a touchdown catching a nine yard throw from quarterback Brady Nabb on Salesianum’s first possession of the game.
Sallies’ win boosts their record to .500 after a couple tough losses to two out-of-state powerhouses in LaSalle College High School and Malvern Prep High School. Sallies is undefeated this season when playing in state competition, beginning the year with a win over Red Lion.
Sussex Central’s loss is its second in as many games. The Golden Knights started the year with two straight victories over West Philadelphia High School in Pennsylvania and Woodbridge, but lost to Hodgson a week ago. The road doesn’t get easier for the Golden Knights as they head home for a matchup with Middletown next week.
Sallies’ next game will be another class 3A matchup against Smyrna next Saturday. That game will be played at the University of Delaware.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Salies-vs.-Sussex-Central-scaled.png,,,2025-09-28 09:56:31.964701

Watching the space between two nations shrink became a regular pastime for Detroiters over the past decade as the segments of the Gordie Howe International Bridge gradually grew, extending meter by meter from Ontario on one side and Michigan on the other.
The gap finally closed in July 2024 with the two halves coming together in a long-awaited kiss.
The official grand opening of the bridge was originally scheduled for fall of 2025, but it seems now likely to be delayed into 2026.
I’m a sociologist who has worked alongside neighborhood revitalization projects in Detroit for the past 15 years. I’ve observed the bridge project – and the many tensions around it – from the perspective of adjacent communities of Delray and Mexicantown, communities that are largely home to low-income Latino, Black and white residents.
The costs and benefits of this binational behemoth are complex and intertwined.
 Clearing a chokehold

Boosters on both sides of the border have spoken frequently of the bridge’s expected benefits.
Detroit and Windsor would finally be free of the perpetual chokehold produced by the privately owned Ambassador Bridge.
Auto parts will flow more freely over the border, according to the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor. And the Detroit Greenways Coalition is celebrating that its advocacy led to the inclusion of free pedestrian and bike lanes.
People living close to the existing bridge will gain some relief from truck traffic and pollution. But this burden won’t simply disappear – it will be shifted nearby, where others will have to cope with increased traffic flowing over six lanes 24 hours a day.

 A political football

The costs and benefits of the bridge were contested from the beginning.
In the early days, the debate concentrated on who would own the bridge and who would pay for it.
Once just a concept known by the acronym DRIC, or Detroit River International Crossing, the project became real under former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. In July 2018, representatives from both Ottawa and Washington broke ground on the bridge situated in an area of Detroit empty enough to contain its significant footprint and bear its weight without fear of sinkholes from underground salt mines.
“Every Michigander should thank every Canadian,” said Snyder at the time, alluding to the agreement that Canadian taxpayers alone would pay for the bridge’s construction in exchange for collecting all the tolls.
The bridge’s designers attempted to honor the cultural and natural history of the region. It was named after the legendary Canadian hockey player who was also a longtime stalwart for the Detroit Red Wings. The bridge’s towers are adorned with murals by First Nations artists.
But serious questions remain.
Today the debates center on whether the Trump administration’s increased tariffs and trade conflicts with Canada could negatively affect the value of the bridge – and if it will ever pay for itself. Even before President Donald Trump took office for the second time, truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge was down, falling 8% from 2014 to 2024.

 One bridge was always a bad idea, (nearly) everyone agreed

Residents and politicians have long agreed that having a single, privately owned bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor was a bad idea. This felt especially apparent after the 9/11 terrorist attacks laid bare the possibility of suddenly losing critical infrastructure.
For many years, travelers’ only other connection between Canada and Detroit has been a tunnel that runs underneath the Detroit River. However, the tunnel doesn’t offer direct access to interstate highways, making it less suitable for commercial trucks.
Adding another bridge makes it harder to disrupt trade and transport.
But the project has had one stalwart critic. Matty Moroun, the trucking billionaire who purchased the Ambassador Bridge in 1979, ferociously protected his asset against potential competition. He actively sought to thwart the construction, launching numerous lawsuits against the state of Michigan and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the entity managing construction of the new bridge.
Those lawsuits continued even after Moroun’s death in 2020, as his heirs asserted significant damages to the value of their property.
 Was enough done for nearby homeowners?

Others have criticized the attempts to compensate the residents of Delray, a once-vibrant neighborhood that has been impacted by industrialization since the 1960s.
Benefits negotiated for residents and homeowners affected by the construction have not increased as the project’s costs ballooned and the timeline to complete it stretched out.
The cost of the Gordie Howe bridge is now estimated at around $6.4 billion Canadian – or about $US4.7 billion. That is $700 million more than the original projected cost. The project is at least 10 months behind schedule.

Simone Sagovac, director of the SW Detroit Community Benefit Coalition, said they did not anticipate the immense scale of the development and its continued effects on the community.
“That scale affected health and quality of life significantly every day, with years of continuous industrial dust causing sinus problems, headaches, and increasing asthma, and then there will be thousands of daily truck impacts to come,” Sagovac wrote to me in an email.
A baseline health impact assessment, issued in 2019 by University of Michigan researchers working closely with the coalition, expressed concern about the heightened airborne pollution that would likely activate asthma, especially in children. Matching the findings of so many other epidemiological studies, the assessment found that residents living within 500 feet (152 meters) of a truck route reported a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing asthma or allergies affecting their breathing.
Sagovac wrote that the project took 250 homes, 43 businesses and five churches by eminent domain, and “saw the closing of more after.” One hundred families left the neighborhood via a home swap program funded as a result of the benefits agreement administered by a local nonprofit. Two hundred and seventy families remain, but most businesses have left the area over decades of decline.
The families that remain are often long-term residents wanting or needing a cheap place to live and willing to put up with dust, noise and smells from nearby factories and a sewage treatment plant.
“They constantly face illegal dumping and other unanswered crimes, and will face the worst diesel emissions exposure and other trucking and industry impacts,” Sagovac wrote.
Heather Grondin, chief relations officer of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, wrote in
that they have taken steps to minimize impacts from construction and that they regularly meet with the community to hear concerns.
“Construction traffic is using designated haul routes to minimize community impacts, traffic congestion and wear and tear on existing infrastructure while maximizing public and construction safety,” Grondin wrote.
According to Grondin, cars will be forced to follow a “no idling” rule on the American side to minimize pollution. Other aspects of the Community Benefits Plan included $20,000 in free repairs for 100 homes, planting hundreds of trees and investing in programs addressing food insecurity and the needs of young people and seniors, Grondin wrote.
An updated Health Impacted Assessment is expected to be released later in 2025.
 History lost

Lloyd Baldwin, a historian for the Michigan Department of Transportation, was tasked with evaluating whether local landmarks like the legendary Kovacs Bar needed to be preserved.
“Kovacs Bar was one among many working-class bars in the Delray neighborhood but stands out for its roughly eight-decade association as a gathering place for the neighborhood and downriver Hungarian-American community,” Baldwin wrote in one such report.
The bar was nonetheless demolished in November 2017.
This was not MDOT’s only loss. While the agency made some sincere efforts to leverage other benefits for residents who remained, dynamic factors at many levels were out of the agency’s control.
For one thing, the numerous lawsuits filed by the bridge company over parcels of contested land limited MDOT’s ability to talk openly to the public about the land acquisition process.
In the period of legal limbo, Baldwin said, “the neighborhood imploded.”
Baldwin gave the example of the Berwalt Manor Apartments, built in the 1920s and located on Campbell Street near the bridge entrance. MDOT committed to preserve the historic building and proposed to mitigate the environmental impacts on mostly low-income residents by paying for new windows and HVAC units once the bridge was built.
But the speed of development outstripped the pace of community compensation. The building passed through probate court in 2018 and has since , so it is now unclear whether there are any low-income residents left to benefit from upgrades.
 Benefits yet to be measured

On the brighter side, environmentalists have pointed to the expansion and connection of bicycle trails and bird migration corridors as long-term benefits of the Gordie Howe bridge.
On the Canadian side, the bridge construction falls largely outside of Windsor’s residential neighborhoods, so it caused less disruption. As part of the project,bike lanes, enhanced landscaping, and gathering spaces were added to an approach road called Sandwich Street.
Cross-border tourism spurred on by a proposed system of greenways called the “Great Lakes Way” may provide new opportunities for people and money to flow across the Detroit River, improving the quality of life for communities that remain.
But if the trade war between the Trump administration and Canada continues, observers may question whether the bridge is a graceful gift of infrastructure to two nations or one of the world’s longest and skinniest white elephants.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Gov. Bill Lee’s Friday press conference about deploying the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis was long on spectacle but short on substance. 
Troops are set to arrive as soon as next week, but the public was given no clear sense of what success is supposed to look like. Will crime fall by 5%, 10% or 15% in the next two weeks, two months, or two years? Without concrete metrics, there is no way to hold the governor, local law enforcement or federal partners accountable.
The lack of clarity stretched across every level of leadership. When the police Chief C.J. Davis and the representative of the U.S. Marshals Service were asked who would lead on the ground, their answers were evasive. Neither the governor, Mayor Paul Young nor Davis offered a straightforward response. 
Lee didn’t even specify how many National Guard members will be deployed. Will it be 5? 15? 50? 150? This basic question, which is central to any credible plan, was left unanswered. Vagueness became the theme of the entire press conference, leaving Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.

This is not public safety! This is what the civil rights lawyer and author Alec Karakatsanis calls “Copaganda.” 
Copaganda is the performance of policing and punishment designed to give the illusion of safety while avoiding the work of justice. It’s a press conference without a plan, a parade of uniforms without a measurable goal, the deployment of soldiers without a clear mission. It reassures some in the public while distracting from the deeper failures of leadership. And too often, it leaves Black communities carrying the burden of mass incarceration.
The problem is bigger than one press conference. Earlier this year, the Trump administration redirected federal funds away from local intervention programs that were making an impact on the ground in Memphis. Instead of supporting community-based organizations working to stop the violence, those resources are now being shifted into heavier-handed law enforcement tactics. 
And in May, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced it would close its investigation into the Memphis Police Department and retract a December 2024 report addressing constitutional violations by police. 
What we are witnessing now is the outgrowth of that failure: an overreliance on police and military muscle while underinvesting in the people and programs that actually reduce crime.
Even the language being used is misleading. When elected officials refer to  the National Guard “resources,” they distort the truth. Memphis doesn’t need more armed patrols in our neighborhoods; it needs jobs, counselors, after-school programs, trauma care and sustained investments in our young people. Calling soldiers “resources” is the kind of rhetorical trick that Copaganda thrives on — it makes people believe help is on the way, when in fact the wrong kind of help is being forced upon us.
Lee’s maneuvers also reek of political calculation. Memphis — a majority Black, majority Democratic city — is being used as a pawn to appease President Donald Trump and bolster the governor’s national ambitions. Instead of addressing poverty, underfunded schools or inadequate healthcare, we are handed a militarized stunt with no exit strategy and no clear measures of success.



				The vagueness of Gov. Bill Lee’s press conference leaves Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.			


And make no mistake: when the cameras leave, it will be Black Memphians left holding the bag. The likely outcome of this so-called “test case” is more police contact, more arrests, more incarceration — and none of the long-term safety or justice our city desperately needs. Copaganda creates the appearance of urgency while avoiding the accountability of results.
If Memphis is truly the stage for this experiment, then those responsible must be required to state plainly what they are testing, how they will measure progress, and who will take responsibility when the results fall short. Until then, we must call this deployment what it is: not a strategy for safety, but a spectacle of Copaganda.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The phrase ‘government shutdown’ is younger than most members of Congress.
Fifty years ago, government shutdowns didn’t exist. But now, each fall, the nation groans as Congress turns one of its most fundamental duties — passing a budget — into a manufactured crisis. As the deadline approaches, Congress stalls, and shutdown threats dominate the headlines until a stopgap measure is slapped together at the eleventh hour.
The calendar is no secret, yet Washington repeats the same frustrating cycle as though the budget deadline appeared out of nowhere. It appears to be high drama, but it’s a failure of legislative responsibility and an executive misstep that traces back to the Carter administration.
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

Shutdowns were never meant to be part of our constitutional system. They emerged in 1980, when a 19th-century law was unilaterally reinterpreted by the Carter administration to allow distinctions between “essential” and “nonessential” services and require agencies to close when appropriations lapse.
For nearly two centuries before that, the federal government continued to function during budget gaps. The founders designed a republic where Congress — through open debate and compromise — would set priorities and authorize spending, not one where the threat of chaos could be wielded as leverage.
A proposal is on the table to get us off this embarrassing and costly budget shutdown merry-go-round. The “Prevent Government Shutdowns Act” (S. 2721/ H.R. 5130) would ensure that the government remains open while forcing Congress to stay in session until the budget work is done. This puts budget pressure where it belongs: on Congress, not on families.
Services would continue uninterrupted, but no new business would be funded. Worker furloughs and backpay bloat would no longer be an issue. Ending shutdown brinkmanship removes the distraction of manufactured crises and requires lawmakers to fulfill their core duty: deliberate, transparent budgeting on behalf of the people they represent.
States have already shown the way. Rhode Island, Wisconsin and North Carolina have automatic continuing appropriations that keep last year’s budget rolling until a new one is passed. Just this year, Kansas joined them. If statehouses can manage it, Congress can too. This isn’t just about protecting programs from disruption — it’s about restoring accountability to the branch of government constitutionally charged with the power of the purse.
Why does this matter? Because the budget isn’t just another bill. The budget drives all policy.
Every decision, from defense to Social Security to small grant programs, flows through the appropriations process. Failure to pass a budget undermines public trust, disrupts services for veterans and families, and rattles the economy. It also leads to “continuing resolutions” that freeze priorities in place instead of encouraging thoughtful decisions about where taxpayer dollars should go.
The shutdown prevention bill would restore predictability, protect taxpayers, and reinforce the legislative branch’s constitutional role. It would also remove the leverage small factions currently hold when they threaten shutdowns. For those who value limited government, this is exactly what we should want: a Congress that does its core job of budgeting responsibly.
This is why Mountain States Policy Center recently joined an open letter led by Americans for Prosperity urging Congress to pass these reforms. It reads, in part, “Automatic continuing appropriations advance inclusive, effective, legislature-driven budgeting. We urge Congress to enact the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act as soon as possible. It would strengthen America’s fiscal democracy, help Congress succeed, and support a more timely and effective appropriations process. Americans deserve a government that works.”
Shutdowns are a modern invention that weaken public trust and create unnecessary turmoil. Theatrics make headlines; statesmanship makes history. It’s time Congress chooses wisely.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderWhat’s the best way to celebrate World Contraception Day?
For some reproductive health advocates, the answer is clear: By breaking out a whimsical, 20-foot-tall inflatable statue of an IUD, affectionately known as Freeda Womb.
The art installation, which belongs to the nonpartisan organization Americans for Contraception, was also part of a 2024 tour aimed at increasing public awareness about contraception that included state capitols, the Philadelphia LOVE statue and even Burning Man. Spokesperson Liz Ernst said the statue serves both educational and metaphorical purposes.
“Many people do not know what an IUD looks like,” Ernst said, adding that its appearance in Georgia aims “to draw attention to two converging crises: A national assault on contraception, and Georgia’s own health emergency.”
Outside Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta on Friday, advocates gathered alongside state lawmakers to call attention to what they see as growing threats to reproductive health access for Georgia residents. 
State Rep. Dr. Michelle Au. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Dr. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat and anesthesiologist who has been a longtime advocate of reproductive rights, argued that a lack of access to health care for Georgia residents can lead to riskier pregnancies.
“Here in Georgia, you have a much higher chance of not having health insurance before pregnancy,” she said. “So that means conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, depression were all much more likely to have gone untreated prior to you getting pregnant, and that makes pregnancy harder.”
Au said that existing health disparities for pregnant Georgians combined with the state’s six-week abortion ban make access to birth control all the more important.
“It is hard to be a pregnant patient in Georgia, so protecting access to contraception, protecting the freedoms and the ability to take personal responsibility for our choices should be something we can all champion unequivocally.”
In Georgia, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill earlier this year to protect access to in vitro fertilization treatment in the wake of an Alabama court decision that ruled frozen embryos are children under state law. But a push to expand those protections to contraception has not gained momentum in Georgia. 
Democrats have pushed measures that would protect access to contraception. Late in the 2025 legislative session, Georgia Republicans championed a bill codifying birth control access that did not advance but remains alive for next year.  
For reproductive health advocates, the lack of action on the state level to protect access to contraception is troubling, especially given the benefits that birth control provides for a variety of different health conditions. 
“For many people, birth control is about much more than preventing pregnancy,” said Alicia Stallworth, the Southeast campaigns director at the nonprofit organization Reproductive Freedom for All. “It’s about managing painful periods, something I myself have dealt with due to uterine fibroids.”
Dr. Mimi Zieman, an Atlanta-based OB/GYN, also criticized Georgia’s ban on abortions after six weeks, cautioning that rollbacks of birth control access could follow. She also urged political leaders to enact policies that protect reproductive freedom.
“Abortion bans and contraceptive restrictions are two sides of the same coin,” she said. “When lawmakers mislabel birth control as abortifacients as a motive to limit access to birth control pills, morning after pills, IUDs and implants — which they are doing right now — or propose fetal personhood bills, they make it harder for physicians to provide evidence-based care.”

Its creator, Kansas native son Jeremiah Ariaz, has zigzagged the state with his cameras to create large-format photographs of our Fourth Estate.

The front page of the first installment of the Kansas Mirror, a photographic project by Jeremiah Ariaz, about the newspapers of Kansas.

The photos reveal newspaper offices — barren and familiar — along with their people — noble and analog. Presses, sitting recumbent, placid and muscular. Desks, littered with notes, books and dust.
Ariaz will visit Kansas State University for a presentation and discussion of his work, which is being displayed at the Beach Museum of Art. The event, from 5:30-6:30 p.m. Oct. 2 at the Beach Museum of Art, is free and open to the public.
Since the last time that I wrote about Ariaz, he published the first edition of the Kansas Mirror. From a distance, the 36 pages that showcase his work resemble the tabloid format of many small newspapers. (The installment is available for purchase on Ariaz’s website.)
Up close, the images pop more crisply from the taut paper than any old-time newspaper photographer would recognize. Ariaz worked through four different press runs to get the photo reproduction dialed in for the carefully chosen paper stock. And it shows in the sharp and saturated images. 
The format and quality of the printing also invites you to remove a spread and display it on your wall, outside the confines of the folded publication. 
Poetry and prose accompany the photos as “dispatches from across the Sunflower State.” Susan Lynn, the editor and publisher of the Iola Register, describes the shrinking coverage from neighboring newspapers.
A poem, titled “This Just In,” by Dodge City Globe editor Whitney Hodgin, relishes the “almost defunct” life of a newspaper journalist. She writes, “Might as well go down with the ship! / The water feels fine!”
The Marion County Record’s Eric Meyer, famous for his newspaper’s encounter with local law enforcement who raided his offices, writes: “What’s really needed are journalists willing to take on the challenge of helping lead communities — especially small isolated ones like this.”
Meyer’s columns of text pair up with Ariaz’s photo of an American flag, seemingly laid to rest on a bed of white. In the background of the image, you might swear you see a coffin lurking under a white drape.  
“Flag, Montgomery County Chronicle, Caney, KS, 2023.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)
Ariaz, during an interview with me last week, explained how he simply photographed things as he encountered them. When a dictionary sat open in the sunlight of an office window, he didn’t turn a page. The book just happened to display a meaningful span of definitions, from “disinheritance” to “disparagement.”
“There’s no way that I could ever plan such a thing,” said Ariaz, a photography professor at Louisiana State University. “It’s just that you’re responding to what you see, but you’re hoping that it can try to tell a bigger story.”
Below are a few other excerpts of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity. 
“William Allen White, The Real Issue, Former Emporia Gazette Office, Emporia, KS.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)
One of the things that symbolically comes through to me, through the austerity of some of the images, is a feeling of isolation, nostalgia and mourning. Is that a mood that you were hoping to establish with the photographs? 
These newspaper offices are, in most cases, the longest-running businesses in those communities. They tend to occupy really prime real estate. They’re kind of gorgeous architecture, and the Emporia Gazette embodied all of that. It’s a building they occupied for 122 years, and it was in operation until just weeks before I arrived. The newspaper is still in operation, but it’s now in another space, in a much smaller location.
It felt like through those images, I was able to speak not just about the specificity of Kansas, but the images were really a conduit to speak about this in a much larger way. So, when you’re seeing details in the photographs, maybe peeling wallpaper, you’re seeing something that becomes a metaphor for the denigration of truth and facts in the public sphere, and that felt really important to me. 
I’m not a photojournalist. I’m not a photojournalist. I’m not thinking about them in that way. I’m thinking about them both in their relationship to Kansas, but also in a way for these images to speak about a loss that is greater than the single place or state. I’m seeking to represent what happens when a community loses a newspaper, a voice, a mirror to their community.
One of the bigger stories that you’re documenting here is the idea that press freedoms are in jeopardy. You photograph what’s happening with newspapers in Kansas and the financial reality. Also, many press freedoms being targeted in 2025 are political — not so much financial. People might strive to separate those two. Or do you see those things as being related?
The problem seems so big, and it seems so abstract. How do you begin to make sense of it? How do you begin to make sense of two newspaper offices closing, on average, every week when the number of reporters across the country has been cut in half? How does someone begin to conceptualize that? And for me, the photographs are not there to say how we got here. One of the things they show is the consequences of that loss, and they provide a way to visualize that, to feel the impact of it.

“Jim, Great Bend Tribune, Great Bend, KS, 2024.” (Jeremiah Ariaz)

Besides the Kansas Mirror, are there any other showcases of this work that you have envisioned?
I’m hoping ultimately to work in a venue that would give me the opportunity to realize sort of a multifaceted exhibition that combines these various elements.
One part of an exhibition that I showed last year in Nashville, Tennessee, was the exterior newspaper offices, just as they exist on Kansas streets. I really love those photographs because they really convey the architecture of the plains, the utilities, often simplicity and a real beauty.
I have a large collection of those. And when I installed those, a selection of those in Nashville, I did it in such a way that they would occupy a grid on the wall. And from that grid, some images were missing. There was a missing component that was representative of the percentage of newspapers that had closed in a period of time.
And then on the opposing wall to fill in those spaces — like literally — kind of a mirror to those open spaces are the same kind of photograph from newspaper offices in Kansas that closed. 
Seeing those two on two opposing walls, that’s an example of something that I would like to do at a much larger scale. So I probably had about 20 or 25 photographs in that exhibition, but that’s something that could be really enlarged. 
There’s a lot of different facets of the project, and I hope to be able to bring them collectively all together in an exhibition.
What do you hear from people who see your images? What sort of reactions do you get from your audience?
I would say there’s a kind of a dual response. I’m mostly showing these images in invited lectures. For example, there’s a conference called “Radically Rural” that happens annually in New Hampshire, and a big focus of that conference is local journalism. 
There’s a real empathetic response because they recognize that this is not just a representation of one place, but it’s something they identify with through their often long careers in small town newspaper offices. There’s something that feels so recognizable. 
To some degree, a point of tension is when I’ve shared this with Kansas communities. There’s a concern that the photographs might feel disparaging to the places that I’m photographing, or to the Kansas press, which is not at all my intention.
The photographs are meant to be something more than the singular place in which they are being made from. They’re really a window to think about, an invitation to think about loss on a much larger scale.
And so there is a bit of tension now I’m doing it in Kansas, because it’s the geographic center of the country. It’s my home state. It’s a place that I have a strong sense that there’s more newspapers in Kansas per population of that state, compared to other states. I’m sensitive to how some of those photographs have been received by people within the Kansas press.

The airline is being targeted at BWI and other airports for flights carrying immigrants to detention in Louisiana. (Getty stock photo)The Moore administration is facing increasing pressure from activists and the head of the Legislative Latino Caucus to boot a discount airline from Thurgood Marshall Baltimore Washington International Airport because it has been flying immigrants targeted for deportation to a detention facility in Louisiana.
The activists are calling out Avelo Airlines, which signed charter contracts earlier this year with the Department of Homeland Security to carry immigrants rounded up by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency from airports across the country to a detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana, where detainees arrive shackled and in handcuffs.
Avelo operated about 20% of the deportation flights in the U.S. in August, according to data compiled by the website Travel and Tour World.
Avelo’s contract with the federal government has sparked protests across the country – including in Maryland, where it has offered a limited number of commercial flights out of BWI since 2021 and currently runs four round-trip flights a week from the state-owned airport.
So far, even as Gov. Wes Moore (D) amps up criticism of President Donald Trump (R) and his agenda, the state has not sought to block Avelo from doing business at BWI.
Maryland’s deal with Avelo allows either party to walk away from the commercial flight arrangement with 30 days’ notice. But Moore administration officials assert they are powerless to stop ICE from running detainee flights out of BWI.
Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), the chair of the Latino Caucus, wrote to Moore and state transportation officials in mid-September, urging them to end their contract with Avelo because the airline is abetting the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants – which often results in immigrants who have legal status being removed from the country.
“I really deeply feel like if we have any control of the business taking place at BWI, we shouldn’t be supporting businesses that don’t reflect the values of Marylanders,” Martinez said in an interview.
He said Moore has yet to respond. But over just a few weeks, the Maryland groups targeting Avelo have collected more than 8,000 petition signatures, urging Moore to cancel the state contract with the airline.
“The main thing is putting pressure on the governor,” said Ryan Harvey, a leader of the Baltimore Rapid Response Network, one of several progressive groups organizing protests over Avelo’s commercial flights at BWI.
But even if the Moore administration sought to remove Avelo from BWI’s lineup of commercial flights, it cannot prevent Avelo or other carriers from running immigrant detainee flights out of BWI or other state airports. That’s because those trips are arranged and overseen by the federal government, and the state is obligated to allow those flights to use airport runways and control towers. The state government has jurisdiction over the BWI terminal and associated businesses, but not airport runways or other flight operations.
‘Aiding Trump’s deportation campaign’
Avelo launched in 2021, just as the U.S. was beginning to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, offering low-cost flights in the U.S. and to nearby Caribbean islands. The carrier began providing commercial service to and from BWI in spring 2022.
“We are thrilled to welcome Avelo Airlines to our market,” Ricky Smith, who was then the executive director of the Maryland Aviation Administration, said at the time. “Avelo will offer low fares and convenient access, and will boost tourism to Maryland and the entire National Capital region. We remain committed to growing our air service portfolio and adding new travel options for our customers.”
Avelo’s financial journey since its launch has been tenuous, according to a recent account by Forbes, which may explain why the airline signed federal contracts worth an estimated $150 million to transport undocumented immigrants.
The blowback has been swift and vocal, with protests erupting across the country. Some call for passengers to boycott the airline, while others have urged government officials to eliminate financial incentives to Avelo for its commercial operations – or to block the operations altogether.
A New York Times article, noting that Avelo flies to several “liberal cities on the coasts,” suggested the airline is “aiding Trump’s deportation campaign.”
Harvey said Maryland activists were inspired when they heard about protests targeting Avelo in Connecticut, which have spread across the country.
“The national campaign is a bunch of local, grass-roots operations that got in touch with each other,” he said.
Similarly, Martinez said lawmakers in Maryland, responding to the concerns of their constituents, have spoken to their counterparts in other states about strategy and tactics.
“I’ve heard from constituents throughout my district,” he said. “They’re really concerned that their tax dollars are being used in some way to deport their neighbors.”
The 2022 deal struck between Avelo and Maryland transportation officials allows either party to terminate the contract for the airline to run commercial flights out of BWI with just 30 days’ notice – which means Moore could end the agreement in short order.
“There should be no repercussions if the state decided that Avelo should pack up in 30 days,” Harvey said.
Jonathan Dean, a spokesperson for the Maryland Aviation Administration and BWI, said the state provided no financial incentives to the airline when it arrived in 2022. He said information on what revenues the state is deriving from the arrangement with Avelo could only be obtained through a Maryland Public Information Act request. Commercial airlines typically pay the state landing fees and charges related to facilities and equipment rental at BWI.
Avelo is currently running a total of four round-trip commercial flights a week in and out of BWI, to and from New Haven, Connecticut, and to and from Wilmington, North Carolina, Dean said. Between July 1, 2024, and June 30 this year, Avelo flew 36,164 commercial passengers at BWI, he said, for a passenger market share of 0.14%.
Courtney Goff, a spokesperson for Avelo, told Maryland Matters that the airline is aware of the protests in Maryland and across the country. But she referred questions on the ICE flights to the Department of Homeland Security.
“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech,” Goff said in an email. “Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that nearly eight million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The ICE media office did not respond to an email with a series of questions about possible detainee flights out of Maryland airports in 2025.
But even if Maryland ended its arrangement with Avelo for commercial flights, that would not prevent Avelo or other carriers from running detainee flights out of BWI or other state airports.
Flights arranged by ICE “are part of a private contract between a flight operator and the federal government,” Dean said.
“A number of these flights have been arranged by the federal government and flown through a private fixed-base operator at BWI Marshall Airport. The national airspace, airline operations, and access to airports are regulated by federal law,” Dean said. “As a federally funded, public-use airport, BWI Marshall Airport is required by federal law to provide access to all certified air carriers without discrimination.
“The Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) does not schedule, inspect, or authorize these flights,” he added.
Dean said MAA officials are aware of one ICE flight that Avelo operated this year carrying immigrants from BWI to the detention center in Louisiana. That’s one of about 30 detainee flights that departed from BWI this year, he said. The others have been operated by GlobalX, a charter airline, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
These flights have yielded no revenues for the state, Dean said. Activists will continue to pressure state policymakers on Avelo, Harvey said.
“Marylanders would like to see leaders do more,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2205333267-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-27 07:56:30.775687

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)There is no bright flash or loud bang, no sharp crackling sound. But the rushing waters of the Potomac River have been electrified.
And for a moment, nothing changes.
But suddenly, they rise to the surface one by one, writhing briefly before they lie still — dozens and dozens of invasive blue and flathead catfish, previously hidden in the gray-blue depths beneath the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, connecting Maryland’s Oxon Hill to Virginia’s Alexandria.
The fish, with their white bellies and small fins pointed skyward, aren’t dead — just stunned. But the biologists aboard the small Maryland Department of Natural Resources jon boat only have a a few minutes before the fish come to their senses and descend once more.
In that time, the small group of scientists can’t hope to collect every fish — at least a hundred in all — in their handheld dip nets, even though extricating the invasive species from the Chesapeake Bay is the ultimate goal.
This experiment in electrofishing, as it’s known, is more to give scientists a snapshot of what is normally concealed: Just how many of the whiskered invaders lurk in one stretch of the Potomac, in a roughly 50-yard radius surrounding the tiny motorboat delivering the shock.

Electrofishing is just one strategy that Maryland policymakers have employed to do battle against the catfish, some of the more prolific invasive species to ever gain a foothold in the Chesapeake Bay after being introduced in Virginia waters in the 1970s.
Blue catfish in particular are known for their indiscriminate appetites, meaning they devour treasured native species from striped bass to blue crabs, and have essentially become a new apex predator in many reaches of the bay. Dozens of species have been found in the stomachs of a single blue catfish, including a variety of crabs, clams, mussels and fish.
Many of the tactics to suppress the bay’s catfish aim to grow a commercial and charter fishery — and encourage restaurants, grocery stores and diners to buy in. Recent changes in Maryland have included allowing charter boats to sell any excess fish that patrons don’t take home.
But Maryland Natural Resource officials and ecosystem scientists are also racing to “know thy enemy,” and uncover more intel about the fishes’ diet, behaviors and population density.
That’s where electrofishing comes in.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The DNR boat — emblazoned with warnings like “High Voltage, Keep Away” — is also outfitted with two outstretched metal arms, each with a set of slender prongs dipping into the water, which deliver the electrical current.
The method has been used for decades by marine scientists to capture and study a variety of species, but it can be customized to largely target catfish, by adjusting the frequency, said Branson Williams, invasive fishes program manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Catfish are particularly sensitive to low-frequency electrical pulses, around 15 hertz.
For other fish, the ideal frequency is higher, around 60 hertz. Northern snakeheads, recently renamed Chesapeake Channa in Maryland, respond best to higher-frequency 120 Hertz pulses, Williams said.
Researchers believe that blue catfish may be vulnerable to lower frequency electrofishing because they are electroreceptive — they possess organs called ampullae of Lorenzini, gel-filled pockets that can detect electric fields, which are more commonly associated with sharks and rays, according to a 2023 article in the North American Journal of Fisheries Management.

“They can detect electric currents like sharks,” Williams said. “When we shock the water, it seems like we kind of overload that system.”
The technology has its limitations. For instance, it can’t be used in saltier water due to its high conductivity, so it can be used in the Chesapeake Bay’s freshwater tributaries, but not in much of the bay’s main stem, which is largely brackish. While the upper bay is fairly fresh, it becomes saltier as you head south toward the Atlantic Ocean, reaching salinity levels of 25 to 30 parts per trillion.
“Two parts [per trillion], fish will come to the surface and go right back down,” Williams said. “It’s kind of a rodeo.”
The department has been using the electrofishing technique on catfish for several years. But now, officials are exploring ways to sharpen it.
Williams said the department is working with university and private partners to evaluate whether drones can effectively photograph the number of catfish lying belly-up in the water, hopefully making counting easier.
And this year, as part of a pilot program, the department commissioned a group of seven volunteer watermen to serve as “chase boat” operators during electrofishing trips, and scoop up as many catfish as possible before the effects wear off. The watermen are allowed to sell that catch.
The group has electrofished at 47 different sites on four different Maryland rivers: the Chester, the Choptank, the Patuxent and the Sassafras. The department plans to offer the program again next year, Williams said.

Williams said some of the watermen were surprised to see just how many catfish rose to the surface, and just how little time they had to capture as many as they could. And once an area is shocked, scientists don’t return again, because the fish become less susceptible to the electrical pulses, Williams said.
“You get one shot,” Williams said.
The September trip was for the benefit of a group of environmental advocates, gathered by Annapolis-based Choose Clean Water Coalition, who watched the demonstration from a nearby vessel.
“Ooh!” yelped some of the onlookers, as the fish squirmed to the surface. “Oh wow,” one said. “Do they feel it?” called another.
The coalition, which represents more than 300 local, state and national organizations focused on improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay region, turned its attention to blue catfish policy in 2023. At the federal level, the group is backing a bill from Maryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) that would explore using blue catfish in pet food.
But the coalition has also been among the groups pushing to remove a requirement that wild-caught blue catfish must be inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — rather than the Food and Drug Administration — a more stringent process that requires an on-site inspector.
The requirement came in the 2008 federal Farm Bill, supported by domestic catfish farmers who wanted to insulate their product against foreign competition. But the coalition believes it is slowing down the effort to catch and process the Chesapeake Bay’s wild-caught blue catfish.
Peter Marx, a federal affairs contractor for the coalition, said recent efforts to undo the rule exclusively in the Chesapeake have been stymied by the Mississippi delegation, which is wary of creating a “slippery slope.”
But Tom O’Connell, director of the Eastern Ecological Science Center for the U.S. Geological Survey, who joined the electrofishing trip, said its also important for fishery managers to think beyond developing and strengthening the commercial market for catfish in the region. That’s why studying strategies like electrofishing is so important, he said.
“If our fishermen are successful — which is great — they may knock down the population to the level which is no longer economically viable for them,” O’Connell said. “So, we need to be thinking about alternative strategy, more efficient gears, different techniques.”

During his remarks aboard the boat, O’Connell briefly mentioned changes to his agency amid President Donald Trump’s (R) tenure, which have included slimming down the agency’s staff.
“In the federal government, we’re seeing a lot of change, a lot of uncertainty,” O’Connell said. “We’re going to continue to provide the science to support the administration’s priorities, and hopefully Chesapeake Bay restoration.”
During the trip in the Potomac, the Maryland biologists netted a variety of blues and flatheads as the environmentalists looked on, including a blue catfish weighing 34.9 pounds, which elicited gasps from the crowd of advocates as biologists hoisted into the air.
Since they’re far from picky eaters, blue catfish can grow to extraordinary sizes. The Maryland state record for blue catfish is 84 pounds, a record that has stood since 2012, despite the species’ increased proliferation in Maryland waters.
The demonstration even attracted a bald eagle in search of an easy meal, which dipped its talons into the water and scooped up a fish of its own.
But the rest of the fish, including the 34-pounder, were bound for a local church’s fish fry, said Tim Groves, a 37-year veteran of Maryland DNR, who works as a biologist in the southern region.
Groves said that he developed connections with local churches and food pantries to donate the large quantities of catfish that the scientists collected during electrofishing operations, particularly during a study that occurred amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“People said ‘Oh, you just need to bury them,’” Groves said. “I can’t consciously do that when there’s hungry people.”

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Steven Adkins/U.S. Air Force)Earlier this summer, in a major win for Maryland gas customers, utility regulators at the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) made an announcement that will save gas customers $1 billion over the next decade.
Each year, gas companies, like Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) and Washington Gas, spend hundreds of millions of dollars connecting new Maryland homes to methane gas pipelines. The utility companies charge existing gas customers for some or all the cost of hooking up new customers to their sprawling network of methane gas pipelines through a policy called line extension allowances (LEAs), which is added to customers’ distribution rates.
Who profits from this spending? Gas utilities. These companies profit up to $3 for every $1 they spend hooking up new homes to gas. While corporate executives and shareholders earn substantial profits off this work, they take none of the risk because customers pay for the costs of the pipes plus interest—payments buried in your gas delivery charges on monthly utility bills.
But thanks to the PSC, this is about to change. Under the new rules, gas customers will no longer be on the hook to cover the cost of system expansion. New customers can still choose to connect to the gas system, but will be responsible for the cost of doing so.

This commonsense step maintains customer choice, while protecting customers from rapidly escalating costs. According to the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, ending this practice will save BGE and Washington Gas customers an estimated $150 million annually, and more than $1 billion over the next decade. Maryland is joining states like New York, Colorado, and Massachusetts who are ending gas line extension policies.
Outdated policies like line extension allowances have contributed to gas companies driving up customers’ bills and raking in record profits. In 2025, alone, BGE planned to spend $103.5 million on new gas hookups. After accounting for interest and utility profits, BGE will charge customers $397 million to cover those costs. Meanwhile, Washington Gas’ planned to spend $56.25 million on line extension allowances in 2025, and the company will charge customers $238 million, more than four times the initial cost.
The mounting cost of gas bills has put a strain on Maryland small businesses and families. In BGE’s territory alone, gas rates have tripled from 2010 to 2023, far outpacing inflation due in large part to excessive spending from BGE on gas line extensions, pipe replacements and other capital projects. This spending is a key factor in BGE profits more than doubling from $210 million in 2013 to $527 million in 2024.
The methane gas system also creates serious risk of explosions and puts our health at risk through polluting gas equipment in our homes, which is responsible for more than $1.3 billion in annual health impacts.
We’re grateful that the PSC and elected officials are responding to the gas affordability crisis in Maryland. The PSC decision leaves the choice to have gas in individual customers’ hands, while wisely ending an expensive, outdated policy that is contributing to escalating rates. And earlier this year, the Maryland General Assembly passed bipartisan legislation known as the Ratepayer Protection Act to rein in this gas pipeline spending to prioritize safety and protect consumers.
The Commission’s decision on gas line extension policy is part of a larger proceeding on the future of gas heat in Maryland. In response to rapidly escalating gas utility costs, the Commission is investigating options to protect ratepayers and ensure regulatory decisions align with state policy, and has appointed a Special Master to oversee the formal proceedings, which began on  Sept. 16.
We’re hopeful the legislature, governor and PSC will continue to work together to address rising gas utility costs by fully implementing the Ratepayer Protection Act and lower the utilities’ incentive for wasteful capital spending.
Instead of spending billions of dollars on expanding a gas system that locks us into burning polluting fossil fuels far into the future, we should make BGE and Washington Gas address pressing safety risks, stop needlessly raising our gas bills, and start taking meaningful action to transition to more efficient, clean energy homes.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/7055499-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-27 06:56:24.867178

(Photo by Senior Airman Cydney Lee/U.S. Air Force)Earlier this summer, the Maryland Public Service Commission issued a ruling that marks  a dramatic departure from decades of balanced energy policy. Under the new proposal,  Marylanders must pay the full upfront cost of connecting to natural gas – often hundreds  or thousands of dollars – rather than paying those costs over time.
This change is no minor technicality. By requiring new customers and homebuilders to  shoulder the full upfront cost of establishing natural gas service, the commission is  putting an affordable, reliable energy option out of reach for many families and  businesses. This comes as residents are already facing record-high energy bills and the  state’s electric grid is struggling to keep up with demand. And it means extra costs for  homebuilders and developers that will likely be passed on to homebuyers.
The commission pointed to Maryland’s climate goals to justify its decision. There’s no  doubt that the realities of climate change demand action around how we power our  lives. But those actions must be grounded in solid evidence, keep energy affordable for  customers, and take into account Maryland’s current and future energy supply and  demand.
The commission offered no explanation for how ending this policy will reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. Nor did it address how the state’s already strained power  grid will support the increased household electric demand likely to result from the  change. The lack of analysis on what this will cost families and businesses is also  unaddressed.

As the leader of the Maryland Building Industry Association, I represent more than  100,000 home builders, remodelers, developers and other building professionals. We  urgently need policies that promote homebuilding and expand access to home  ownership, not ones that drive up costs and put owning a home further out of reach.  Unfortunately, this policy does exactly that.
This is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a troubling shift in Maryland’s energy policy – one that risks higher costs to consumers, a less reliable power grid, and more difficulty  attracting industry and new jobs to our state.
From new building standards to restrictions on how we heat our homes, Maryland  leaders seem to be advancing a one-size-fits-all energy agenda that aggressively  supports electrification, regardless of consumer preferences, affordability or impact on  energy reliability. Natural gas is approximately three times more affordable than  electricity and is often the preferred choice for cooking and heating. Yet, the state is  making it harder to access through changes like the one proposed. The result: higher  utility bills and fewer options.
At a time when Marylanders are already stretched thin by inflation and rising housing  costs, these added burdens make it harder for families to make ends meet and for small  businesses to grow. This isn’t just energy policy. It’s a cost-of-living issue, a housing  issue, and a jobs issue.
Maryland’s electric grid is not suited for the weight of a fully electrified economy.  Already, during heatwaves and cold snaps, the system is pushed to its limits. Just this  month, thousands of electric customers in Maryland experienced outages. In the past  two years, wholesale electricity prices in the PJM market – the region’s grid operator – are up over 1000%.
By sidelining natural gas, the commission is jeopardizing energy reliability. A diverse,  balanced energy mix that includes natural gas is the smartest way to ensure residents  can keep the lights on and their houses cooled and heated during even the most high-demand periods.
We support a pragmatic climate and energy strategy rooted in facts, fairness, and  common sense. Maryland can take action to address climate change without closing the  door on affordability, energy resilience, and consumer choice.
It’s time for a more balanced, inclusive approach – one that honors what Marylanders want and puts people, not politics, at the center of our energy future. At the Maryland  Building Industry Association, we’re ready and willing to work with the state to find real  energy solutions. Let’s get to work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/7946159-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-09-27 06:56:24.867178

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/University of Washington, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency)The commercial salmon harvest in Alaska’s Bristol Bay, site of the world’s largest sockeye salmon runs, held a mixture of good news and bad news this year.
The run of sockeye salmon, also known as red salmon, exceeded preseason expectations and totaled 56.7 million fish, the seventh highest since 2005, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game reported in its preliminary summary of the summer harvest. The commercial sockeye harvest was also bigger than expected, totaling 41.2 million fish. That was 18% above the preseason forecast and 23% higher than the recent 20-year average.
The total amount of money paid to fishers delivering their catches totaled $215.3 million, about 7% above the 20-year average of $200.7 million, the department said in its summary.
The bad news is that while Bristol Bay sockeye salmon continued what has been a streak of huge runs – and while sockeye dominate the commercial harvest — other salmon species there continued to falter. Bristol Bay’s harvest of Chinook, also known as king salmon, hit a 20-year low this year, totaling only 6,148 fish, compared to the most recent 20-year average of 33,469 Chinook, the department reported.
Chinook salmon runs have been weak across much of Alaska and the North Pacific, so the decline is not unique to Bristol Bay.

	The opposite trends of Bristol Bay sockeye and Chinook salmon have not been fully explained. One hypothesis is that climate change currently favors sockeye, which spawn in warming lakes where habitat may be expanding, over river-spawning Chinook.
Tim Sands, a Bristol Bay area management biologist, believes that warming has something to do with the sockeye-Chinook divergence.
He said warmer winters at the higher elevation lakes in Bristol Bay’s Wood River and Nushagak River systems have expanded the ice-free growing season for young salmon.
“These slightly longer growing seasons allow for slightly larger juveniles that are a tad bit more competitive when they enter the ocean and survive at a little higher rate,” he said by email. “The ocean environment is also more hospitable for juvenile sockeye salmon.”
Why that is true for sockeye but not Chinook is something he does not know, he said.
It is difficult to figure out what is happening to salmon after they return to the open ocean, said Bert Lewis, a regional supervisor for the department’s Division of Commercial Fisheries. “That is kind of a black box in our understanding,” he said.
To try to find some answers, the department operates a Salmon Ocean Ecology Program with some scientific partners.
Another important trend – the average size of Bristol Bay salmon – provided some mixed signals.
The harvested sockeye weighed in at an average of 5.1 pounds apiece, above last year’s record-small average size of 4.53 pounds and slightly above the 4.9 pound average of the past five years, according to the department.
 

The average weight of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon from 1980 to 2025 is shown in this graph. The trend is toward smaller fish. (Graph provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game)
 

	Still, Bristol Bay sockeye are significantly smaller now than they were decades ago, when fish typically weighed in at 6 to 6.5 pounds.
Sands said this year’s mix of fish ages account for the improvement in average fish size.
According to department surveys, 61% of the returning fish had spent three years out in the ocean, compared to 38% that had spent only two years. That was a big contrast with last year, when about 80% of the returning fish had been growing in the ocean for only two years, according to last year’s Fish and Game summary.
Last year’s big skew toward younger fish was an “outlier,” Sands said. He tied that to the hot and dry conditions of 2019, which inhibited reproduction of the salmon that would have normally returned in 2024 after spending three years in the ocean.
Lewis said the department has been monitoring the fish sizes closely. The trend to smaller sizes was first detected in Copper River Chinook, he said. While the trend is especially pronounced in Chinook, it is now happening in other species and around the state.
The relatively small size of individual fish in Bristol Bay might have something to do with the huge size of the runs, where “abundance has exploded,” Lewis said.
This was the 11th straight year with a Bristol Bay sockeye run exceeding 50 million fish, according to the department’s summary. And generally, bigger runs are made up of smaller fish, Lewis said.
 “The adage big run-small fish, small run-big fish seems to apply here,” he said.

Santiago/Getty Images)Nevada was removed from the Trump administration’s list of “sanctuary” states this week after Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed an agreement with the Department of Justice to fully collaborate on federal immigration enforcement — making Nevada the first state to be removed from the list.
Nevada was initially placed on the federal list of sanctuary jurisdictions on Aug. 5 following an executive order by President Donald Trump directing the Justice Department – in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security – to identify places where officials “continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws.”
Lombardo has denied Nevada’s status as a sanctuary state since making it on the list, and said the agreement “reaffirms our commitment to following federal immigration law in Nevada.”
In a statement announcing the agreement, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said “We applaud Governor Lombardo and Nevada for taking necessary steps to fully comply with the Trump Administration’s immigration policy. This should serve as a reminder to other jurisdictions: come to the table and work with us instead of going to court.” 
Nevada plans to use FEMA funding to upgrade Washoe County Jail for ICE

The agreement lists several commitments Nevada must make to remain off the list of sanctuary states in the future, including the continued use of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to assist in federal immigration operations. 
In August, Nevada agreed to use FEMA funds to upgrade detention facilities at the Washoe County Jail to include dedicated holding cells and office space for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Under the agreement, Nevada will also continue to use the state’s National Guard to provide administrative support in immigration enforcement operations. 
“DOJ will provide notice of further opportunities for Nevada to collaborate with the federal government on immigration enforcement including identification of laws and policies that impede federal law enforcement,” the agreement reads. 
The agreement points to several policies that lead the Justice Department to place Nevada on the list of sanctuary jurisdictions, including the state’s “Model Immigration Policies,” which offers guidance from the Nevada Attorney General to state employees on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
The non-binding policies were mandated by the Nevada Legislature in 2021 and include guidance for limiting immigration enforcement in public spaces, while also complying with federal law.
Lombardo accused Nevada’s Attorney General Aaron Ford of attempting to “implement sanctuary policies” through the model immigration policies.
“Despite the Attorney General’s attempts to implement sanctuary policies, Nevada is not a sanctuary state, has never been a sanctuary state, and will never be a sanctuary state under my leadership,” Lombardo said.
Lombardo hammered for authorizing Nevada National Guard to help ICE

The agreement also notes that “Nevada will take steps available in law to counter-balance any actions the Nevada Attorney General and Nevada Legislature may take to enact unlawful sanctuary policies.”
In response to Lombardo’s comment and the agreement, Ford emphasized that he has “never supported sanctuary for criminals.”
“The sanctuary designation from the Trump administration happened on Governor Lombardo’s watch — which is yet another failure of his tenure,” Ford said. “Unlike the governor, I have actually passed legislation to crack down on fentanyl being trafficked across our border, and have won more than $1 billion to combat the opioid issue right here in Nevada.”
The agreement outlines several actions Lombardo and state officials took to remove Nevada from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions, including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rejoining the federal 287(g) program in June, which authorizes officers to perform some immigration enforcement functions.
Lombardo’s veto of a bill that would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school or provide student records without a warrant was also highlighted in the agreement.
The agreement also noted actions Lombardo took to stop Nevada’s Office for New Americans from providing legal assistance referrals for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and those seeking Temporary Protected Status or Legal Permanent Residency.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x6831758914118-1.jpg,,,2025-09-26 22:57:22.158240

NPM, previously known as Nebraska Educational Telecommunications, interviewed Neihardt, known for writing “Black Elk Speaks,” including by one of its best-known broadcasters, Ron Hull. Those discussions eventually led New York-based TV talk show host Dick Cavett to host Neihardt for a lengthier interview that Cavett — a Nebraska native — called one of his most memorable.
The group’s Wordsender Award honors people and organizations that share Neihardt’s writings, themes and how he wrote and felt about the frontier, Native Americans and more. “Wordsender” is how Black Elk described Neihardt, an author and poet who sent an accurate version his story to others.
NPM will receive the award Nov. 9, during the group’s “Laureate’s Feast” at Omaha’s German-American Society. Tickets are available at neihardt.org or the Neihardt State Historic Site at 402-648-3388.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game may allow personal watercraft, commonly called Jet Skis, in Kachemak Bay south of  Homer.
The unanimous decision by the five-member court overturned a lower-court judge who had ruled in 2023 that the state could not eliminate a Jet Ski ban once it was imposed.
The state of Alaska moved to allow Jet Skis in 2019 in Gov. Dunleavy’s first term after lobbying by personal watercraft groups, including the Personal Watercraft Club of Alaska.
Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox and ADF&G Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said by email on Friday that the ruling has broader implications than Kachemak Bay because the justices affirmed that if the executive branch imposes a regulation, it implicitly has the power to reverse that regulation.
“Today’s decision is a win for Alaskans who value access to our waters. It confirms the Department’s ability to remove outdated rules and ensure our parks and public lands remain open for responsible recreation. We’re pleased the Court recognized the importance of keeping regulations flexible and reflective of how Alaskans enjoy the outdoors,” Vincent-Lang said.
Four local groups — Cook Inleteekper, the Kachemak Bay Conservation Society, the Alaska Quiet Rights Coalition and Friends of Kachemak Bay State Park — had sued the state in 2021 after the Dunleavy administration lifted a Jet Ski ban that had been in place since 2001.
Attorney Sam Gottstein represented the four groups in court and said by phone Friday, “Although we are disappointed in the decision, I think it is fair to say that this ruling generally recognizes an agency’s authority to modify or repeal its own regulations.”
Earlier this year, Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued Administrative Order 360, which launched a yearslong, statewide effort to repeal “burdensome” regulations.
“This is a win for Alaskans. The Alaska Supreme Court affirms our authority to repeal outdated rules when the facts don’t justify them. That’s exactly the AO 360 playbook: take a hard look, cut red tape, protect what matters. More commonsense regulatory reform ahead,” Cox said by email.
In Friday’s 36-page order, Justice Jude Pate — writing on behalf of the court — said that the Fish and Game commissioner “had the regulatory authority to enact (a ban), and this authority necessarily includes the authority to repeal (the ban).”
Gottstein had argued unsuccessfully in court that state law only permitted regulatory changes for the purpose of environmental conservation, effectively allowing only a one-way door.
“It’s like a parent saying, ‘I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it,’” he told the court in 2024. “The reality is, no parent has that right, just like Fish and Game doesn’t have that right.”
But Pate appeared skeptical of that position during oral arguments and rejected it in Friday’s written order.
Citing other states’ supreme courts and federal court rulings, he wrote, “as other state and federal courts have noted, agencies generally have the authority to amend or repeal their own regulations. That authority is implied from the agency’s authority to promulgate rules in the first place.”
If agencies weren’t allowed to repeal regulations, it “would spawn zombie regulations, unslayable once promulgated, no matter the passage of time or change in circumstances,” Pate wrote.
The groups challenging the state had also argued that the Dunleavy administration’s decision to repeal the Jet Ski ban was predetermined. They submitted two internal emails as evidence, but the court determined that those didn’t help the groups’ case. 
The emails fell short of establishing that the governor’s office was certain that the repeal would occur, much less that the governor predetermined the outcome of the regulatory process, Pate wrote. 
The court concluded that the Department of Fish and Game appropriately took a “hard look” at available scientific evidence and facts before lifting the ban, including the fact that modern Jet Skis are less polluting and quieter than they were when the ban was imposed.
The Supreme Court ordered that the case be returned to Superior Court for final proceedings.

Public comment on the reorganization is open through Sep. 30.
The Forest Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, currently has offices in Anchorage, Juneau, Cordova, Valdez, Girdwood, Seward, Craig, Hoonah, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Thorne Bay, Wrangell and Yakutat. It isn’t clear how many of those offices will remain open after the reorganization. 
The status of the Forest Service’s tourist-focused visitor centers in Portage, Juneau and Ketchikan also isn’t clear.
Contacted for details, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said by email on Friday, “Some aspects of the reorganization will take place over the coming months, while others will take more time. We will continue to provide updates as the reorganization moves forward.”
They added, “We recognize this may be difficult, but we are hopeful that affected employees will remain with us through this transition as we work to improve and continue delivering benefits to the people and communities we serve.”
In a July memo outlining the basic details of the plan, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said she intends to close the Forest Service’s nine national regional offices “over the next year” but “will maintain a reduced state office in Juneau, Alaska, and an eastern service center in Athens, Georgia.”
Research stations, like the Juneau Forestry Science Laboratory in Auke Bay, will be closed and “consolidated into a single location in Fort Collins, Colorado.”
Nationally, Rollins said she intends to scatter more than half of the Agriculture Department’s 4,600 Washington, D.C.-based administrators to five regional hubs; one each in Utah, Colorado, North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana.
This follows prior actions by the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which earlier this year fired about 3,400 Forest Service employees nationally, including more than 100 in Alaska.

BURLINGTON — A federal judge sentenced the man who pulled the trigger in a fatal murder-for-hire plot to more than 16 years behind bars while ordering the man who recruited him to a lighter prison term. 
Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Jerry Banks and Aron Lee Ethridge on Friday for their roles in the death of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville more than seven years ago.
The hearings for the two men in federal court in Burlington came a day after the judge addressed the cases of two other men convicted for their roles in the same deadly scheme. 
During the Friday hearing for Banks, the man who carried out the murder, Reiss gave Banks 200 months, or just over 16 years, followed by five years of post-release supervision. The judge spoke about balancing the role each man played in the crime with the sentences they would get.
“One of my concerns in this case is disparity,” Reiss said.

The judge called Banks’ role in the crime “abhorrent” and “heinous” and emphasized he was ultimately the one who pulled the trigger. But Reiss also said she believed Ethridge had exploited Banks, who had a history of mental illnesses and substance abuse, into carrying out the crime at one of the lowest points in his life. 
Later Friday afternoon, Reiss sentenced Ethridge to 140 months, or more than 11 years, for his role in the murder.
Reiss said Ethridge’s cooperation with law enforcement, two days after he was initially questioned, was one of the most timely she had ever seen. She also recognized he did so without an agreement for a lesser sentence, other than the death penalty being taken off the table. 
“Your cooperation set the dominos in motion,” she said, adding that he helped investigators nail down the roles of the others in the murder plot.
Yet, the judge said, Ethridge still played a central role in the murder scheme that involved three other men.
“Nobody said no,” Reiss said.
The two sentencing hearings featured defense attorneys talking about their clients’ pasts and what eventually brought them together.
Banks, 38, grew up surrounded by violence, drugs and alcohol, facing housing insecurity without stable parental support after his father left when he was 4 years old. His mother struggled with addiction. When Ethridge — his closest friend at the time —- asked him to carry out the murder, Banks had just lost his dog and had recently broken up with his girlfriend after a decadelong relationship. 
“I will do better if I get out,” Banks said in court, apologizing to the Davis family for the crime and adding that, although he can never make amends for what he did, he wants to be a good person moving forward. 
Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow, also addressed Banks during the hearing. A photo of her with her seven children was projected on courtroom monitors as she spoke.
“This is the hardest of the four statements I must give because today I stand before my husband’s killer,” she said. 
Melissa Davis recalled how Banks kidnapped her husband from their home on a night in January 2018, and how months before, he had spied on them, watching their children run in and out of the house. 
“Yet you were not moved by the love of family you witnessed,” she said. 
“But after years of tears and prayer, I can stand here today strong enough to say, ‘I forgive you,’” Melissa Davis said, looking at Banks, who returned her gaze, nodded and whispered, “thank you.”
Banks, a former jail guard who had lived in Fort Garland, Colorado, pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors to charges of murder for hire, conspiracy to kidnap and money laundering. Under the terms of the agreement, he could have been sentenced to life in prison. 
Steven Barth, Banks’ attorney, asked the judge to impose a prison sentence of 12.5 years, contending that Ethridge “exploited” and “took advantage” of Banks’ vulnerabilities in convincing him to carry out the killing. 
Banks, Barth added, saw Ethridge not only as a friend, but as a father figure and mentor whom he wanted to please. 
Ethridge, in speaking to the judge later, denied that he ever pressured Banks.
Even if Banks had backed out at some point, his attorney said, it was “inevitable” that the other three men involved in the plot were going to make sure that Gregory Davis was killed.
“The parties were dead set, with or without him,” Barth said.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig disputed that the killing would have happened even if Banks had pulled out. He called on the judge to impose a prison term of 20 years. Stendig said that while Ethridge may have egged on Banks to carry out the killing, it was Banks who ultimately pulled the trigger. 
Stendig also outlined the “chilling” and premeditated nature of Gregory Davis’ killing. The prosecutor rattled off the string of states Banks had to drive through to get from Colorado to Vermont, stating that he could have backed out any time along the trip, but he didn’t.
Pretending to be a U.S. marshal, complete with a badge, Banks told Davis he was under arrest and presented him with a phony arrest warrant, Stendig said. Banks then placed Davis in handcuffs and drove him away before shooting him repeatedly in the back and leaving his body in a snow-covered pull off along the road only a few miles from his home.
Stendig said Banks reported that he carried out the deadly hit on behalf of a “Turkish prince” – a title fraudulently used by Serhat Gumrukcu.
Gumrukcu, whose sentencing hearing started Thursday but was then delayed until November, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Berk Eratay, a former close friend of Gumrukcu, was sentenced Thursday to a little more than nine years for his role in Gregory Davis’ killing. 
Prosecutors argued during Gumrukcu’s trial in April that he masterminded the plot because he was concerned that Gregory Davis, with whom he had been involved in a failed oil deal, could expose his fraudulent business dealings.
On Friday, the prosecutor and Ethridge’s attorney Mark Kaplan asked for a 150-month prison term for Ethridge, a former railroad conductor from Henderson, Nevada. 
“Eight years ago I made the worst decision of my life,” Ethridge said. He apologized to the Davis family for the “terror and sadness” he caused, and to his own family for not being there for them, particularly his 5-year-old daughter. 
“I sincerely hope that my actions and behaviors brought some closure to the family,” he said, with his voice breaking in sobs. 
As Melissa Davis approached the prosecutor’s table to make her statement, Ethridge turned his body toward her and listened carefully. 
Melissa Davis offered Ethridge her forgiveness, thanking him for his cooperation with investigators.
“Your choices brought harm, but your daughter can still see a father who chooses the way of truth,” she said to him. 
“I’m so sorry,” a tearful Ethridge said when she finished speaking.
The judge set hearings for November in all four cases to determine the restitution they will have to pay to the Davis family.
Reiss, near the end of Friday’s hearing, pointed out that the recurring theme in all the cases was that the four men involved had many talents and abilities, from strong computer skills and leadership qualities to disarming charisma.  
“When you have good gifts,” she said, “it’s important not to use them in the wrong way.”

Jim Pillen listens during a summit of the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska with business leaders in the Sioux City area. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen on Friday rejected proposed regulatory changes he said had been pushed by a former director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission facing federal charges alleging public corruption involving two Lincoln strip clubs.
Pillen, in posts Friday morning on social media sites Facebook and X, said he would not allow a man accused of taking “bribes and sexual favors” to lift the ban on customers touching the employees at such establishments that also serve liquor. 
The language the governor targeted would have removed labeling any contact like kissing or touching of the breast, buttock or genital areas as a “disturbance” that requires automatic reporting. He also rejected the other changes proposed under the former director’s watch for this year. The regulatory process started last November and was sent to Pillen in February.
“My team caught it, stopped it from proceeding, and today I am formally rejecting this immoral, inappropriate and profoundly misguided policy change, as well as terminating all pending rule changes out of the Liquor Control Commission,” he wrote.
Ex-Liquor Commission director, strip club co-owner each plead not guilty

But the Governor’s Office, responding to questions Friday from the Examiner, clarified that Pillen does not want to shift the independently run Liquor Commission under the governor’s direct control as he did with the Nebraska State Historical Society.
The Legislature in 2024 placed governance of the state history agency under the governor after the State Auditor’s Office flagged some privately raised money it alleged was mishandled and a former director faced criminal charges.
That’s why Pillen’s Friday post alarmed some who prefer to keep the Liquor Commission, a governor-appointed board whose members serve six-year terms and must be confirmed by the Legislature. It also raised hackles among advocates for medical cannabis.
They care because members of the Liquor Commission also serve on the voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, so some worried that efforts to redesign the Liquor Commission might give the governor more control over cannabis, too.
Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple on Friday afternoon said the governor was not attempting to change the governance of either board. She said he was simply rejecting any potential rule or regulation changes proposed by the indicted former director.

“The governor’s action today does not affect any Cannabis Commission rules,” she said, adding. “We support the Liquor Control Commission remaining an independent agency.” 
Hobert “Hobie” Rupe has pleaded not guilty to seven felony charges, including three counts of honest services fraud — a charge that a public official or employee deprived the people of their honest work or services. 
The Liquor Commission suspended him in May. It replaced him starting next week with Micah Chaffee, an attorney who worked with the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee and State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the committee chair. 
The interim director told the Omaha World-Herald on Friday that the commission fully supports Pillen’s decision to reject the touching language change. Bruce Bailey, the Liquor Commission’s chair, did not immediately return a call Friday seeking comment.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — When John Thune disagrees with people, he tries to do it “in a respectful way,” he said Friday.
So what he said about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might be as close as Thune gets to a put-down.
“He’s got some very interesting views,” Thune said.
The Republican U.S. Senate majority leader from South Dakota made the comments in response to an audience member at the Black Hills Forum and Press Club. The question came from Sherry Bea Smith, who identified herself as a nurse from Nemo, a small Black Hills community.
Trump and RFK Jr. are making claims about autism. What do medical experts say?

Smith said “Americans have been placed in harm’s way” by Kennedy, the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Smith asked Thune — who voted for Kennedy’s confirmation — if he has a plan to “provide oversight and take action to ensure the health and safety of the American public.”
Thune replied that the Senate is exercising its oversight role and will continue to do so. He referenced a “fairly argumentative and explosive and combative” Senate Finance Committee hearing with Kennedy earlier this month, and said he expects more hearings like that if Kennedy takes actions that senators view as out-of-step with science.
“I think that’s where a majority of my colleagues are,” Thune said. “And I think if RFK veers off too much one way or another on that, I’m guessing he’ll be brought back into a zone that’s more consistent with that overall philosophy.”
Kennedy sparked controversy recently with his assertion that Tylenol is one potential driving factor behind autism, despite the medical community describing the link as inconclusive. Kennedy’s critics responded with concern, including for pregnant women. Medical professionals worry that if pregnant mothers avoid using Tylenol to treat fevers, they could increase their risk for miscarriage and other complications.
Thune, who has two daughters and three granddaughters, indicated he shares that concern. He said recommendations and decisions about public health should be made by “medical professionals, by people who are grounded in science, grounded in medicine, and have done the research.” Kennedy is a lawyer, not a physician or scientist.
“Especially on an issue like Tylenol,” Thune said, “that ought to be something that your doctor gives you advice about.”
Another controversial Kennedy move was his firing and replacement earlier this year of everyone on an influential vaccine advisory panel. That panel has since moved to change recommendations concerning childhood vaccines, COVID-19 immunizations and more.
Before Kennedy was appointed to the Trump administration, he was known for spreading false and misleading information about the safety of vaccines, including a repeatedly debunked claim that some vaccines lead to autism.
Thune said he’s had discussions about vaccine safety with President Donald Trump.
“The president believes in vaccines,” Thune said. “He’s made that very clear.

(Washington State Parks)The price to visit state parks in Washington will rise on Oct. 1, with a $15 hike to the annual cost of a Discover Pass.
State lawmakers approved the increase from $30 to $45 earlier this year. It marks the first time the pass’ price has gone up since they were introduced in 2011. 
Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites. 
The Discover Pass provides one year of unlimited entry to all Washington state lands managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Natural Resources.  
Under the rules going into effect Oct. 1, off-road vehicles transported to a recreation site by another vehicle don’t need to display a Discover Pass so long as the other vehicle has a valid pass and is parked on site. 
Also going into effect Oct. 1 are changes to the Lifetime Disabled Veterans Pass, allowing passholders access to lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources and Fish and Wildlife. The pass previously only granted access to State Parks lands. 
These changes were approved by the Legislature last year as part of Senate Bill 5390.
Revenue from pass sales goes to Washington State Parks, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources, with State Parks receiving the bulk of the money.  
State Parks says these funds are critical to supporting recreation and conservation opportunities, keeping bathrooms cleaned and trails maintained, and supporting forest health. 
Revenue from the Discover Pass and other fee-based funding accounts for about 71% of Washington State Parks’ budget for the 2025-27 biennium — up from about 65% in the last budget cycle. 
State Parks’ operating budget, like many agencies, saw cuts this year as lawmakers dealt with a budget shortfall. 
The agency’s two-year operating budget for the 2025-27 cycle is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for 2023-25. 
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget. 
With projected state revenue falling short of expectations, State Parks kept its 2026 budget asks to a minimum.
The agency’s largest request from the Legislature is $189,000 to hire a staff person to work on meeting the requirements of a settlement the agency reached with the U.S. Department of Justice last year over Americans with Disabilities Act violations. 
As part of the settlement, the state must provide the U.S. Attorney’s Office with a list of noncompliant facilities and make a timeline for bringing those facilities into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
State Parks has seven years to work on the updates and must report its progress to the federal government every six months.

(Courtesy of Lamp Rynearson) OMAHA — After more than two years of study and often controversial neighborhood meetings, developers of a planned North Omaha area business park fueled by a $90 million state grant have announced a major pivot: No longer will they pursue the purchase of residential properties for the project site.
The possibility of homeowner dislocation ignited public backlash early on. Controversy calmed over time as public officials and developers assured property owners they would not be forced out and that any move would be voluntary and compensated. 
But the development team led by the Omaha Economic Development Corp., which has been immersed this year in negotiations with residents of a preferred site, announced Friday that it is dropping the prospect of buying any homes.
Homes, urban farm stand at site of proposed Omaha business park buoyed by $90M in state funds

Instead, the team that also includes Burlington Capital and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce said it will acquire vacant and abandoned sites to carry out its goal of creating shovel-ready land to attract jobs and industrial users to one of the more disinvested areas of the state. The OEDC-led group in January 2024 was awarded the business park grant from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Before that, the team was awarded a smaller grant to assemble a planning document.
 Multiple sites possible

George Achola of Burlington said the team is now focused on three site options. He said the end result could be one, two or even three spots.
The group has not ruled out developing a smaller chunk within the larger 160-acre tract that the team had eyed as its priority site, west of the Omaha airport and north of Carter Lake — the area in which many of the early opponents to the plan live. Any chunk would not include occupied residences, though, Achola said.
While some residents had expressed interest in voluntary relocation — and the compensation that would have accompanied it — the overriding thought was to respect the broader community’s desire for “stability and continuity,” a statement from the development team said.
“The decision reflects the voices of the community, many of whom shared a strong desire to remain in their homes,” said OEDC president and CEO Michael Maroney.
The announcement comes about nine months after the Omaha Inland Port Authority Board, which oversees the business park process, approved the release of nearly $7.4 million of the larger state grant so that the OEDC-led team could conduct pre-development research. Key to that was a deeper dive into whether the priority site was viable and that the developer could amass enough private property to make it work.
Garry Clark, executive director of the Omaha Inland Port Authority, commended the development team for “listening deeply and responding with integrity.”

“Prioritizing underutilized land not only respects the wishes of our residents, it also opens new pathways for innovation and investment,” Clark said. “It’s a thoughtful recalibration that keeps people at the center while driving forward the transformative potential of the Airport Business Park.” 
Melissa Youngblood, who is on the port authority’s Community Advisory Board, said she doesn’t have a personal home in the priority site but grew up with some who do. She said many residents with deep roots there did not believe monetary compensation would be enough to start over in similar circumstances elsewhere in Omaha. 
Plus, she said, many wondered why the developers didn’t set their sights on vacant or run down areas where people did not live. 
In some cases, Youngblood said, “They would be taking away not just somebody’s home but their whole life.”
 Developers ‘relieved’

The business park project is an anchor of the port authority district that was formed to nurture growth across about 3,000 acres of the North Omaha area near Eppley Airfield, which has seen disproportionately higher rates of unemployment and disinvestment than most parts of the state.

State law recently changed to enlarge the area in which the business park could be developed, dropping an earlier requirement that the park be located within two miles of the airport and instead allowing it to be within the broader boundaries of Omaha’s inland port authority district. That opens up different opportunities and an area that stretches as far west as North 30th Street and Ames Avenue.
Achola declined to comment on the current frontrunner sites or possibilities, saying real estate prices could jump.
Earlier, a top site the OEDC team identified near 16th and Locust Streets was found to require costly environmental cleanup, but a port authority official said that area had not been ruled out.
The $90 million set aside for the business park was part of the Economic Recovery Act approved by the Legislature in 2022 and updated in 2023, built originally off of federal pandemic recovery funds. The OEDC-Burlington-Chamber team won the grant, saying it planned to use the funds to prepare a shovel-ready site and to market the area to businesses that would build a job-producing industrial hub.
The port authority board was established after the Economic Recovery Act laid out parameters for the business park. 
Achola said the goal is still to have a site or sites pinpointed later this year and to see construction begin the early part of next year. He said chamber officials, meanwhile, continue to seek potential tenants for the park.
“It’s never a straight linear line,” Achola said of developing real estate projects in populated parts of a city. “We’re relieved things are starting to take more shape.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — A trial that could determine whether state-imposed abortion restrictions can remain in Kansas began Friday with testimony from the abortion providers behind the challenge.
Traci Lynn Nauser, an OB-GYN who owns a clinic in Overland Park, told a small but full courtroom about the burdens of state legislation requiring abortion providers like herself to comply with a litany of anti-abortion rules.
The bench trial in Johnson County District Court examines the Kansas Women’s Right to Know Act, which was passed in 1997 and modified several times by the Kansas Legislature over the years.
Nauser said many of the state’s requirements broke down trust from the beginning of her patient interactions. Iman Alsaden, the chief medical officer for Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified that the state’s restrictions undermined informed consent and relationships with patients.
The trial’s outcome could impact how abortion providers and lawmakers do business. Attorneys for the state dissected Alsaden’s and Nauser’s expertise on medication abortions, abortion reversals and the experiences of patients.
The Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy organization, brought the lawsuit in 2023 on behalf of Nauser, her practice and Planned Parenthood, challenging the 1997 law and its amendments. The lawsuit came nearly a year after Kansas voters in 2022 rejected an attempt to eliminate the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, which the Kansas Supreme Court established in a 2019 ruling on a case brought by Nauser and Herbert Hodes, Nauser’s father.
That vote made Kansas one of the few states in the region to cement abortion rights, but Republican lawmakers found ways through additions to the Women’s Right to Know Act in 2024 to couch those rights with new mandates for abortion providers.
Among them, lawmakers created a requirement that physicians must tell patients at least five times that medication abortions can be reversed, a procedure Nauser has never performed, calling it “experimental,” unproven and potentially dangerous for patients. It also created the “reason mandate,” which requires physicians to ask patients to disclose the most important factor in deciding to obtain an abortion. Some reasons given ask whether the patient has too many children already or if the patient cannot provide for the child.
The center asked a judge in 2024 to add the new laws to its lawsuit, which was allowed, and in October 2023, Judge K. Christopher Jayaram granted a temporary injunction, halting the implementation of those laws
“We are now able to get patients the care they need when they need it,” Alsaden said.
The lawsuit also challenges requirements that providers disclose state-sanctioned anti-abortion language, including the false claims that abortion poses a risk to future pregnancies and increases the risk of breast cancer. Physicians have to present the information in a specific typeface, font size and color. And patients have to wait 30 minutes after meeting with their provider before they can receive abortion care.
Nauser said during testimony Friday the state’s requirements were “the antithesis of informed consent.” She said the state’s materials contained misinformation, burdened the patient-physician relationship, required patients to jump through hoops and necessitated what Nauser described as long, confusing conversations.
She said she is unaware of any patient of hers that did not get an abortion because of the state’s mandates.
Alice Wang, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, asked Nauser if she had ever come across a patient who regretted getting an abortion.
Nauser said patients have mixed feelings, including grief or sadness, but not regret. Wang asked Nauser to give an example.
Nauser began to cry.
She was one of those patients, she said.
Roughly 25 years ago, Nauser said, she became pregnant with quadruplets after struggling with infertility. Nauser and her husband decided to abort two of the fetuses with a procedure in Detroit to increase the likelihood of survival for the remaining two. At 20 weeks, pregnancy complications arose. One of the remaining fetuses was stillborn, and the other was born alive but didn’t survive. She said she basically had four abortions in one pregnancy.
The lead attorney for the state, Lincoln Wilson, of the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, pointed out while cross-examining Nauser that around one-third of patients don’t schedule a follow-up appointment following an abortion, and of the two-thirds who do, they frequently don’t show up, according to previously disclosed information from Nauser.
Nauser inherited her medical practice and clinic, Center for Women’s Health, from her father, who is a retired OB-GYN and abortion provider. Her first memory was her father performing surgery on a teddy bear, she said. Later, she said she remembered pickets outside her family home on Sundays, which was how she learned her father performed abortions.
During Wang’s examination of Nauser, Wilson repeatedly interrupted with objections, which Jayaram had little patience for.
Teresa Woody, an attorney on the case in her capacity as a private practitioner rather than in her role as litigation director for the advocacy organization Kansas Appleseed, said in an interview with Kansas Reflector that she believes the plaintiffs have very sound grounds in the trial. She said the temporary injunction is a good indicator for their arguments.
“None of us can read the future, but based on those things and the case law that is there now, we feel confident that these requirements and restrictions are unconstitutional,” Woody said.
Kansas solicitor general Anthony Powell, a former state representative and appeals court judge, is overseeing the team of attorneys for the state.
The trial is scheduled to continue with witness examination Monday and Tuesday, which will be followed by a nearly monthlong pause until it picks up again Oct. 14.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250926_nauserwang-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-26 19:57:15.306263

School district officials and politicians spoke out Friday about the arrest of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, with some calling for empathy and others appalled that someone with “a prior weapons charge and an active deportation order” was placed in charge of Iowa’s largest school district.
Initially, online information from ICE indicated Roberts had been placed in the Pottawattamie County Jail after his arrest. Later on Friday, however, Roberts’ name and information were no longer searchable on the ICE locator website.

According to a press release from ICE, Roberts was in possession of a handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash when he was detained. Agents had approached Roberts in his vehicle during a “targeted enforcement operation,” the release stated, after which he allegedly sped off. Officers later found his car abandoned, the agency stated.
The Iowa State Patrol assisted ICE in locating the vehicle after Roberts allegedly drove off, according to a release from the Iowa Department of Public Safety. The release stated that Roberts was in the custody of “immigration authorities.”
In its press release, ICE said Roberts has “existing weapon possession charges” from February 2020, which the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to independently verify. Roberts did plead guilty to unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle after a November 2021 offense, a fifth-degree penalty, according to court records from Erie, Pa.
Roberts was also given what ICE called a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024  after coming to the United States in 1999 on a student visa.
“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson in the agency’s press release. “This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats. How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”
Mason Mauro, deputy communications director for the office of the governor of Iowa, said Gov. Kim Reynolds was “made aware” Roberts had been arrested, and added that she was “in contact with the Iowa Department of Public Safety and federal authorities.”
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said in a social media statement he stands with law enforcement, adding that Friday’s incident emphasizes the need to “fix our broken immigration system.” Nunn’s office has opened more than 800 cases since 2023 to “help Iowans navigate immigration issues,” he said online, and that work will continue.
“An individual with a prior weapons charge and an active deportation order should never have been placed in this position of public trust,” Nunn said in an online statement.
The school district had little information to share at a Friday afternoon press conference, with school board president Jackie Norris saying “there is much we do not know.” She acknowledged that new information has come to light in the wake of Roberts’ arrest, but added that the district has not been able to independently verify that information.
The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners granted Roberts a license to serve in Iowa as a superintendent in July 2023 when he started in his job at Des Moines Public Schools.
“It seems fitting to take a page out of Dr. Roberts’s book and ask the community to engage in radical empathy as we work through the situation together,” Norris said Friday. “Radical empathy is the recognition that we can disagree and still empathize with each other. The respect of others’ humanity — this concept will be essential as we wait to learn more.”

Como ex-comisionado de redistribución de distritos de California, he presenciado de primera mano el proceso cuidadoso, deliberado y transparente que definió nuestras divisiones en el Congreso para reflejar la realidad de nuestro estado. El trabajo no fue fácil, pero fue honorable y salvaguardó el principio de que cada comunidad merece una representación justa.
 Es por eso que me siento alarmado y profundamente decepcionado por la forma en que las conversaciones en torno a la Proposición 50 , la medida de redistribución de distritos de mitad de ciclo de California, a menudo se han reducido a una única pregunta superficial: “¿Cuánto costará?”.
 Sí, estas elecciones especiales tienen un costo financiero . Pero si las analizamos solo en términos de dólares y centavos, ignoramos los riesgos mayores. Se estima que 3.4 millones de californianos podrían perder su cobertura médica debido a los recortes a Medicaid , y otros 3.1 millones de personas —niños, veteranos y familias— se enfrentan a la pérdida de la asistencia nutricional vital a través del SNAP.
 Este momento tendrá consecuencias mensurables que transformarán la salud y la estabilidad de nuestro estado, al tiempo que erosionarán constantemente los cimientos de nuestra democracia.
No podemos ignorar la realidad de que la reestructuración de los mapas de este año en Texas y otros estados , a instancias del presidente Trump, ha sido ampliamente cuestionada como manipulación racial de los distritos electorales. Esto continúa un modelo generacional en muchos estados, donde se trazan límites para debilitar las voces de las personas negras, morenas, inmigrantes y de la clase trabajadora, para que los políticos puedan elegir a sus votantes.
 La Constitución es clara: la función del Congreso es promulgar leyes y actuar como contrapeso del poder ejecutivo. Sin embargo, el Congreso, liderado por los republicanos, no ha cumplido esa función. En lugar de actuar como garante, el Congreso ha eludido su responsabilidad y se ha convertido en un simple sello de aprobación para los caprichos inconstitucionales del presidente.
 La responsabilidad de frenar este abuso de poder recae ahora en los estados y en la propia ciudadanía. Por eso, California debe hacer todo lo posible para contrarrestarlo. La redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de mandato es una necesidad moral. Necesitamos aprobar la Proposición 50 y hacer todo lo posible para mantener la línea.
 El verdadero costo de la inacción se hace evidente cuando los niños pasan hambre porque sus comunidades son apartadas del poder político y sus necesidades son ignoradas.
 El costo real se hace evidente cuando las familias trabajadoras son silenciadas, mientras los donantes ricos y los políticos arraigados redibujan los mapas para protegerse.
 El costo real aparece cuando generaciones de lucha por una representación justa son borradas de un plumazo que divide barrios y disuelve comunidades de interés.
 Y, en última instancia, el mayor costo lo asume nuestra propia democracia. Si nos negamos a actuar por temor al costo de unas elecciones especiales, somos cómplices de pagar un precio mucho mayor en dignidad humana y erosión democrática.
 Ser comisionado de redistribución de distritos significó escuchar a miles de californianos: padres, trabajadores agrícolas, empresarios, pastores, estudiantes, personas mayores y más. Compartieron historias sobre quiénes son y cómo funcionan sus comunidades, desde el Valle Central hasta la costa, desde las ciudades hasta los pueblos rurales.
 Honramos la Ley de Derecho al Voto estatal , respetamos a las comunidades de interés y elaboramos mapas públicos para que todos los vieran. Fue la democracia en acción. Fueron los californianos quienes demostraron que la redistribución de distritos independiente y transparente no solo es posible, sino necesaria.
 Ahora, frente a la manipulación racial deliberada de los distritos electorales en otros estados y a los excesos sin control del ejecutivo en su país , California debe responder con la misma determinación.
 La democracia nunca es gratuita. A cada generación se le pide que invierta en su supervivencia. Pero la pregunta que nos ocupa no es si la redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de mandato es costosa. La pregunta es si seguiremos permitiendo el coste descontrolado de leyes inhumanas, abusos inconstitucionales y órdenes ejecutivas de gran alcance que afectan a los californianos comunes.
 Hemos visto a esta administración presidencial desmantelar los programas de DEI y enviar a la Guardia Nacional a nuestras ciudades bajo falsas acusaciones de “crimen desenfrenado”, mientras recorta los mismos programas que lo redujeron . Ha atacado y criminalizado a personas vulnerables bajo el pretexto de la “seguridad pública”.
 Es una falta de visión que los californianos solo piensen en California en este momento. Quedarse de brazos cruzados y permitir más de lo mismo es rendirse al autoritarismo a cámara lenta. Las garantías que una vez creímos que nos protegerían simplemente no se sostienen.
 Ahora no es momento de neutralidad. Si revertir el rumbo es lo que se necesita para proteger la representación, la equidad y la democracia misma, entonces debemos actuar.
 El precio de la justicia siempre será menor que el precio de la injusticia. Esa es la verdad que debemos recordar antes de decidir qué significa realmente “costo”. Por eso insto a todos los californianos en edad de votar a que apoyen la Proposición 50, para que podamos dejar de lado temporalmente los mapas electorales del Congreso de 2020 y hacer nuestra parte para oponernos a los excesos autoritarios.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 19:57:15.306263

 Comentario invitado escrito por 

 Juana Raya
 Jeanne Raya dirige una agencia de seguros y reside en San Gabriel. Fue presidenta de la primera comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos de California. 


 En 2008, la Ley de Votantes Primero creó la Comisión Ciudadana de Redistribución de Distritos de California, un organismo independiente integrado por personas que reflejaban la diversidad del estado. Grupos de buen gobierno impulsaron la iniciativa electoral, buscando asegurar que los votantes fueran, como lo indicaba el nombre de la ley, priorizados. Dos años después, formé parte de la primera comisión.
La aprobación por parte de los votantes de una comisión independiente puso fin de manera efectiva a la manipulación partidista que caracterizó la redistribución de distritos en California durante décadas.
Los miembros de la comisión dedicaron casi un año a elaborar nuevos mapas , lo que permitió a los ciudadanos acceder a más de 100 reuniones públicas y a diferentes formas de presentar comentarios por escrito. Los votantes pudieron describir sus comunidades, y determinar su infraestructura y su economía. Esto proporcionó a la comisión una visión general de California y ayudó a crear distritos que ofrecían a los votantes una oportunidad justa de elegir representantes responsables.
 La comisión de California se considera ahora el estándar de oro para la redistribución de distritos en Estados Unidos, libre de intereses partidistas y llevada a cabo totalmente a la vista del público.
 Ojalá Texas aprendiera de California. Allí, los legisladores adoptaron nuevos mapas en agosto en un intento de manipular las elecciones de 2026 a favor de los republicanos, a instancias del presidente Donald Trump . Sus acciones representan las motivaciones más viles de políticos tan temerosos de perder el poder que solo se les ocurre hacer trampa.
 Su determinación de manipular las posibilidades del Congreso impulsó al gobernador Gavin Newsom a implementar una redistribución de distritos electorales a mitad de ciclo electoral en California para elegir a más demócratas. Ahora está en manos de los votantes en una elección especial el 4 de noviembre. La Proposición 50 reemplazaría los mapas trazados por la comisión independiente del estado con distritos trazados por los legisladores únicamente para obtener o proteger escaños demócratas. Y esa protección se extenderá a lo largo de tres ciclos electorales.
 No se trata precisamente de un cambio temporal.
Como demócrata registrado, celebraría el reemplazo de los miembros del Congreso que han olvidado su juramento de servir a sus electores y proteger la Constitución. Pero no puede ser a costo de la Constitución de California, ni de sus votantes que exigieron una redistribución de distritos justa e imparcial.
 Newsom afirmó que la acción de los republicanos texanos justifica un ataque de represalia . Pero a diario presenciamos el caos y la desconfianza que genera la política de venganza en Washington. Ese no es el modelo de gobierno responsable que merecen los californianos. Los californianos tampoco quieren gastar millones de dólares de los contribuyentes en la apuesta de que diferentes distritos congresionales producirán el cambio deseado, mientras que los problemas reales siguen sin resolverse.
 Nadie conoce la cantidad mágica de escaños demócratas necesarios para ganar esta guerra electoral, especialmente a medida que más estados republicanos se suman a la contienda, además de Texas. ¿Está dispuesto el gobernador a arriesgarse a perder a los titulares en distritos californianos más competitivos? ¿Aceptará el fracaso si los demócratas se quedan cortos a nivel nacional?
 Este no es un momento sin precedentes. Llevamos décadas viendo cómo la manipulación partidista de los distritos electorales suprime la capacidad de decisión de los votantes, socavando la confianza y alimentando el cinismo. Sabemos que, una vez que reciben el poder, los políticos lucharán por conservarlo con la confianza de que una declaración de crisis es la única excusa que necesitan.
 Newsom debería buscar una respuesta diferente a la guerra de redistribución de distritos.
El representante Kevin Kiley, por ejemplo, propuso una legislación para prohibir la redistribución de distritos a mediados de década en todo el país . No sé qué llevó a Kiley, republicano del condado de Placer, a este punto. Quizás fue instinto de supervivencia ante la amenaza de perder su escaño . Pero considerar una solución nacional a un problema nacional sería una iniciativa bienvenida.
 Newsom afirma que los demócratas pueden recuperar el Congreso si se les da al pueblo estadounidense una oportunidad justa, voz y opciones. En California, la gente ya tiene esa oportunidad, y es la comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos.
 Los californianos pueden enviar un mensaje claro a Newsom y a los líderes legislativos el 4 de noviembre para que respeten la voluntad del pueblo y no sacrifiquen la comisión independiente de redistribución de distritos, ni los recursos financieros limitados del estado, por ganancias políticas a corto plazo.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-26 19:57:15.306263

Lauren Boebert speaks to supporters during an election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024 in Windsor, Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican, is one of just four Republicans in Congress supporting efforts to force a floor vote on releasing U.S. Department of Justice case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
Legislators leading the effort have said a petition that would force a vote on a resolution requiring the full release of the Epstein case files has enough signatures to pass, but allies of President Donald Trump continue to oppose a floor vote on the issue.

The resolution, led by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, was introduced before Congress went into recess, but House Speaker Mike Johnson let the members go early to avoid a vote on the resolution. 
Boebert, the only Colorado Republican to sign the petition, has long sought an aggressive Epstein investigation and called for a special counsel to take the case this summer. The four Republicans who signed the discharge petition are Boebert, Massie, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.  
All four Colorado Democrats in the House — U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood — signed the petition.
The government’s investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse has dogged and splintered House Republicans since July, when Trump’s administration declared it would not share any further information on the powerful and well-connected financier, with whom Trump was friends. Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. 
Boebert’s office did not respond to a Newsline request for comment.

Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, in an opinion letter dated Thursday, recommended Hoskins reject the petition because the law describing the form says the petition must refer to “laws” passed by the General Assembly.
In the opinion letter, which has not yet been published on the attorney general’s website, Hanaway wrote: “A bill passed by the Missouri House of Representatives and Senate does not become ‘a law’ until it is either ‘approved by the governor’ or until the bill is not ‘returned by the governor within the time limits prescribed by this section.’” 
The redistricting plan, she wrote, “has not been signed by Governor Kehoe.”
In a statement to The Independent, Hanaway’s office said proponents should have waited.
“State law only allows a referendum on measures that have been enacted into law,” the statement provided by spokeswoman Abigail Bergmann read. “The referendum petition was thus premature.”
The redistricting plan seeks to flip the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, to Republicans. President Donald Trump began pushing for Missouri to redistrict in late July.
Richard von Glahn, leading the committee People Not Politicians in its quest to put the plan on a ballot, immediately called shenanigans and his attorney, Chuck Hatfield, wrote a letter demanding a revision.
“It is a matter of public record that the governor has announced his assent to the bill and intends to sign it on Sunday of this week,” Hatfield wrote in a footnote to his legal analysis. “Delaying review of the referendum forms on that basis is simply silly. Nothing allows you to do so.”
To be successful, a referendum petition must have signatures equal to 5% of the vote for governor in six of the state’s eight congressional districts. The petitions must be submitted within 90 days of the adjournment of the legislative session that passed the new law.
Lawmakers concluded the special session on Sept. 12, giving von Glahn’s group until Dec. 11 to submit the signatures.
“People Not Politicians has continued to face obstinance from politicians who refuse to perform their administrative duties and adhere to legal deadlines around processing the legally submitted referendum petition,” a news release from the campaign stated. “The group continues to gather signatures to put the issue before Missouri voters.”
If the decision is not reversed, the issue will go to the courts, von Glahn said.
“We are confident the courts will side with Missourians constitutional right to a referendum, as they always have,” he said in the news release.
In his letter challenging Hanaway’s legal analysis, Hatfield wrote that her constitutional references are inaccurate and she missed important sections that control the referendum process.
“Your letter ignores (the referendum clause), which guarantees to the people the ‘power to approve or reject by referendum any act of the general assembly,’” Hatfield wrote. “That is exactly what Mr. von Glahn seeks to do and the constitution is extremely clear.” 
In 2022, the Missouri Supreme Court found two laws that impeded the referendum process were unconstitutional. In that decision, the court found that signatures gathered before the ballot language for the petition had been written were valid.
In that case, administrative delays by the attorney general and the secretary of state were found to be improper barriers when opponents of a law banning abortions attempted an initiative in 2019.
“This is the same stuff we went through on the abortion case,” Hatfield said, “and the courts of appeals told them you can’t do that.”
This story was updated at 6 p.m. Friday with a comment from the attorney general’s office.

(iStock photo/ Getty Images Plus)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Friday she has joined attorneys general from 22 states in urging the Trump administration to oppose environmental policy from the European Union. 
The letter points to two elements of the European Union’s corporate sustainability directive and says they impose “sweeping” requirements tied to diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social, and governance practices, also known as DEI and ESG, that would place “severe burdens” on American businesses. 
Led by Florida and West Virginia attorneys general, the letter says the reporting requirements would cost American companies financially, create disincentives for American companies that use or invest in fossil fuels, “and worse, it creates potential liability for companies who do not wish to partake in this climate radicalism.” 
Bird, in a news release about the letter said the EU directives would be “bad for Iowa” and for the country. 
“I’m thankful we can bring this very urgent concern to the Trump Administration and know they have our country’s best economic interests at heart,” Bird said in the release. “The EU’s radical green agenda attempts to gut our energy industry and all the industries that rely on them, including agriculture, trucking, and manufacturing.”
The European Union is set to implement the “Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive” and the “Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive” both of which require companies that do a certain amount of business in the EU or globally to file reports on their environmental and social impacts. 
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, according to the EU, requires companies to publish reports detailing the “social and environmental risks they face, and on how their activities impact people and  the environment.” 
“This helps investors, civil society organisations, consumers and other stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability performance of companies, as part of the European green deal,” the EU stated on its website explaining the directive. 
The letter from the Republican attorneys general says these reports would require an “inordinate amount of time and expense” to create and would put “conflicting pressure” on companies that have changed their environmental, social, and governance practices “in response to (President Donald Trump’s) electoral landslide.” 
The letter says these reports would also make companies susceptible to “green-washing lawsuits.” 
According to the EU the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive’s core elements are “identifying and addressing potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts” from business operations, subsidiaries and through the value chain. This directive also requires companies to adopt a climate mitigation strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2050 climate neutrality objective. 
The letter calls this directive “a demand that ESG and DEI be incorporated into companies.” The letter also objects to the “aggressive” enforcement mechanisms of the “unconstitutional and immoral requirements.”
The attorneys general end the letter asking Trump to sdirect U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to oppose the EU’s directives.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza at a commercial turkey facility in Sanpete County, leading health agencies to quarantine all commercial facilities in the area. 
The highly pathogenic form of bird flu is contagious and may cause high mortality in poultry and wild birds. 
“Commercial turkey facilities in the northern U.S. and here in Utah have been the most impacted by HPAI this fall. With migratory bird season just beginning, we may see a greater impact as the season progresses,” State Veterinarian Amanda Price said in a statement, urging poultry producers to maintain strong biosecurity measures. 
The reported case involved a single round of birds from a facility in Sanpete County. The birds on that site will be “depopulated to prevent further spread,” the department of agriculture said in a news release. 
The state agency is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the response to the outbreak and will conduct additional surveillance and testing in neighboring areas.

“The loss of this flock is a significant hardship for the producer and their community,” Utah Department of Agriculture and Food Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said in the release.
However, he said the case “is not expected to cause a notable impact on the availability of turkeys in Utah or across the country leading up to Thanksgiving.”
“Consumers should feel confident that turkey and poultry products remain safe and readily available,” Pehrson said.
While the virus is a serious disease for birds, it currently doesn’t present an immediate risk to public health, the department said. 
Domestic flocks can get the disease from direct contact with wild birds, contaminated equipment or people moving between flocks. Signs of highly pathogenic avian influenza include frequent death in flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption and lack of coordination in birds. 
“Owners of birds experiencing any of these signs should immediately contact the State Veterinarian’s Office at statevet@utah.gov,” the release advised. Resources to protect flocks can also be found on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website.

Martin Heinrich on Sept. 26, 2025 in Las Cruces discussed the impact the loss of Affordable Care Act health insurance rebates would have on NM. (Leah Romero for Source NM)As a possible federal government shutdown looms, so does the chance that thousands of New Mexicans will see significant increases to their health insurance premiums.
The health insurance credits have become a sticking point in negotiations over a spending bill Congress needs to pass to avoid a government shut-down at the end of the month.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) spoke in Las Cruces Friday alongside representatives of BeWell, the state’s health insurance marketplace; La Clinica de Familia, a private, federally qualified health center; and New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, a social justice advocacy organization.
Heinrich explained that if passed, the GOP-led government funding bill will mean the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits will expire at the end of the plan year, and people insured under the ACA will see their monthly insurance premiums increase between $300 and $500.
Democratic governors rally Congressional Republicans to extend health care tax credits

“I don’t know about you, but after the last few years of increased costs, when you think about how inflation and tariffs have impacted everything from beef to coffee to what you buy at the hardware store, I don’t know New Mexicans who can afford another $300 or $400 a month in their health care premiums,” Heinrich said during the news conference. “This is going to be absolutely dire for the state of New Mexico… In addition, the president has basically directed his leadership in the Congress not to negotiate.” 
Victoria Hernandez, outreach and eligibility specialist for BeWell, explained that BeWell currently provides assistance to more than 75,000 New Mexicans to pay monthly premiums — about double the enrollment from several years before. With premiums increasing, “We’re going to have our families, our individuals, our fellow New Mexicans making some tough decisions,” she said. “Do I pay for health care, do I pay for rent, do I pay utility bills and my car payment?
NM Center on Law and Poverty Policy Director Arika Sánchez explained that the state has made significant progress in reducing the number of uninsured residents over the last decade – from 22% in 2013 to 12% in 2023.
“With nearly 810,000 New Mexicans currently accessing Medicaid and enrollment of about 75,000 on BeWell, the impact of coverage losses will be devastating, especially for our rural communities, low-wage workers, caregivers, hospitals and clinics,” Sanchez said. “And we know that when people don’t have health insurance, they’re forced to skip checkups and testing and the care they need. They wait until things get really bad before going to the doctor, and they often end up in the emergency room where services are the most expensive.”
She added that six to eight hospitals will be at risk for closing their doors within the next two years, if assistance is discontinued.
John Andazola, chief medical officer for La Clinica de Familia, said while his clinic will continue seeing patients regardless of their ability to pay, the loss of assistance will mean patients may not be able to pay for tests, X-rays, vaccines and other preventative care. It also could mean that the clinic will have to reduce its staff, cut services or close completely.
“Health care costs will rise due to delayed care, but also access to basic services will diminish if we are forced to reduce programs or worse, cut care and again, close our doors,” he said. “These cuts will not only threaten the physical health of our patients, it’ll threaten our patients’ financial stability.”
The New Mexico Legislature is slated to convene for a special session beginning next week, where health care coverage is included in the agenda. Fernandez said BeWell will be asking for  additional funds to support people in paying their increased premiums. 
“Our concern is that the state can’t sustain this forever,” she said.

Free.,Supreme Court allows Trump to cancel $4B in foreign aid already approved by Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-allows-trump-cancel-4b-foreign-aid-already-approved-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday reaffirmed its ruling from earlier this month that the Trump administration can withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, though the order notes the decision “should not be read as a final determination on the merits” of the case.White House budget director Russ Vought wrote on social media shortly after the order from the emergency docket was released that it represented a “Major victory.”The new nine-page order doesn’t provide any additional details about why a majority of the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to rescind the funding without congressional approval. But it does include a dissent written by Justice Elena Kagan that was supported by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighting the stakes in the case. “This emergency application raises novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress,” Kagan wrote. “It arises from the refusal of the President and his officers to obligate and spend billions of dollars that Congress appropriated for foreign aid.”The case, she wrote, brings up an issue the Supreme Court has never addressed.“Deciding the question presented thus requires the Court to work in uncharted territory,” Kagan wrote. “And, to repeat, the stakes are high: At issue is the allocation of power between the Executive and Congress over the expenditure of public monies.”Kagan noted that since the case came to the justices on the emergency docket, they had less than three weeks to consider it. “In a few weeks’ time—when we turn to our regular docket—we will decide cases of far less import with far more process and reflection,” Kagan wrote.She goes on to disagree with the majority of the justices, saying the Supreme Court “should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves.”Trump administration actions found illegal by watchdogThe ruling the Supreme Court posted Friday is similar to the one it released in mid-September when Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. overturned a district court ruling that would have required the Trump administration to spend the money. The case now largely revolves around whether the White House budget office has the authority to send Congress a rescissions request during the last 45 days of the fiscal year, a maneuver the Government Accountability Office has called illegal. When the White House asks Congress to cancel previously approved spending through a rescission, lawmakers are supposed to have 45 days to approve, modify, or ignore the request. But Vought believes that any rescissions request sent up during those 45 days allows the White House to unilaterally cancel the funding, regardless of whether lawmakers agree or not. The Trump administration asked lawmakers to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs this summer through a rescissions request.Lawmakers mostly approved that proposal after preserving full funding for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.The White House budget office then sent lawmakers a second rescissions request in late August, proposing they claw back billions of additional foreign aid dollars. Neither the House nor the Senate has yet to vote on that proposal. But the Supreme Court’s ruling allows the White House budget office to withhold the funding anyway. Democratic members of Congress reactHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., issued a joint statement after the court’s ruling calling on their GOP colleagues to protect the institution’s power over spending decisions. “Congress can—and absolutely should—promptly reject President Trump and Russ Vought’s illegal effort to do an end run around the people’s elected representatives by passing a bill like the one we introduced last week,” they wrote. “Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse, rather than allow a president and an unelected bureaucrat who do not respect Congress or the Constitution to continue attacking our power to fight for the people back home that we represent.”",,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Jeanette Mullinax/Released)The U.S. Department of Defense has quietly extended the timeline to clean up “forever chemicals” at more than 100 military sites around the country, including Montana’s largest military outpost. 
Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls is among 140 military sites with a delayed investigations and remediation timeline for chemicals known as PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — which can take thousands of years to break down and can be present in water, soil and even food. 
The chemicals are found in waterproofing material, food packaging and in fire-fighting foam. The last source, used in emergency response training at airports and military bases, makes the Department of Defense one of the most prolific users of the chemicals. 
Studies have linked exposure to the chemicals with increased risks of cancer, immune disorders, problems with child development, and other adverse health effects, according to an EPA health advisory.
A Government Accountability Office figure showing the cleanup status of current and former DOD military installations, as of June 30, 2024.
The Defense Department has identified more than 700 military installations where PFAS was used or may have been released. Since 2017, the Department has spent $2.6 billion investigating and cleaning up the substances, according to a recent report to Congress. 
A spokesperson for Malmstrom could not immediately address Friday the extent of the cleanup that’s needed at the base. He estimated the population at the base to be from 4,000 to 5,000 people based on residential units and dorms.
The delays to cleanup timelines were first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday. The Times cross-checked a list of contaminated sites, only publicly released by the Pentagon in recent weeks, with a timetable released in December 2024, in the final days of the Biden administration. Roughly 140 sites have listed dates to complete preparatory work and begin cleanup pushed back several years. 
The Daily Montanan’s analysis of a progress report from Sept. 30, 2024, found that Malmstrom was slated to have its remedial investigation and feasibility study completed by September 2026. That date has now shifted to June 2032, according to the departments’s new progress report.
Estimated dates for two U.S. Army locations — Helena’s Fort William Henry Harrison and Helena Aviation Readiness Center — to investigate and complete feasibility studies for cleanup have not changed, with investigation and feasibility studies estimated to end in March of 2026 and September of 2028 respectively.
Nolan Lister, a spokesperson for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, said work on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process at Malmstrom is currently in the remedial investigation phase, and confirmed that the process has been extended for five more years, a decision that is “supported by DEQ.”
Lister said that the  report is expected to be submitted to DEQ in Spring  2026, and that data will then be incorporated into a feasibility study to determine the best actions for remediation. 
While no clean-up has yet been completed at the base, Lister said “best management practices” have been implemented to reduce PFAS in stormwater discharges and a “sundown” of aqueous film-forming foam in fire suppression systems. Fire and emergency vehicles are also in the process of switching to a fluorine-free foam, Lister added. 
“The Air Force has contracts in place to properly dispose of all (aqueous film-forming foam) collected from hangars and vehicles by end of 2025,” Lister wrote in an email. “In addition, at known (foam) release sites, any construction projects are required to coordinate with remedial project managers, and PFAS-contaminated soil is managed to minimize runoff. Any PFAS-impacted groundwater from dewatering is required to be treated or disposed appropriately as well.”
The New York Times reported that while the delays in site-specific cleanup operations were announced quietly, it comes amid debates about the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which in its current form would undo a ban on purchasing and using firefighting foam made with PFAS and shrink funding for toxic site cleanups. 
However, the NDAA also contains provisions to “accelerate remediation” of PFAS-contaminated sites, and provides for the department to create a publicly available online dashboard to track response efforts at each military installation. 
According to a 2025 Government Accountability Office report to congress on PFAS cleanup, the Department of Defense, referred to by the Trump administration as the “Department of War,” says that costs for investigation and cleanup have skyrocketed. 
“The department’s estimated future PFAS investigation costs more than tripled since 2022, while estimates for future pFAS cleanup costs have increased 15-fold,” the report states.
Lister, with Montana DEQ, said the department is “not aware of any funding delays regarding our PFAS investigations at Malmstrom or the Great Falls National Guard site,” but that if funds were shifted away from remediation efforts it could “slow progress along the CECRLA path, resulting in additional time passing before implementation of cleanup.”
“The Department of War has not communicated any potential funding delay,” Lister said. 
A Department of Defense PFAS progress update from March, 2025.
At the Montana Air National Guard Base in Great Falls, also listed on the DOD list of contaminated sites, remedial investigation work was expected to begin in September. Lister said that the remedial investigation is planned and “will be sequenced for funding alongside other ANG and Air Force enterprise-wide locations.”
The state’s cleanup efforts are funded through the Defense and State Memorandum of Agreement program on a two-year funding cycle. 
“DEQ is currently working through the process of generating work plans known as Joint Execution Plans with our federal partners for work that will be conducted 2027 to 2032,” Lister added.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 released new drinking water standards for certain PFAS compounds. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says they are still reviewing the new information and will look to adopt the standards into rule during a two-year process. 
According to EPA’s new recently released standards, public water supplies have three years to meet the PFAS sampling requirements and then two additional years to implement a remedy if the water quality results exceed the new standards.
The Department of Environmental Quality has sampled public water systems in Montana for PFAS contamination in recent years. Only one location, in Kalispell, was found to exceed EPA advisory levels.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/30564504860_7b53442c15_k-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-26 18:57:01.524118

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)There are many closed doors at the state Capitol in Olympia. 
Sometimes it’s understandable. Confidentiality can be necessary in politics and policymaking. There are also meetings and conversations among public officials where it is not. Where the doors should remain open.
Meetings we’ve pressed for information about and access to in recent days provide examples of this latter category. 
One was on nuclear energy. The other Gov. Bob Ferguson called with fellow statewide elected officials. 
Both are reminders of the reflexive lack of transparency and inclination to tightly control the flow of information, that are now deeply ingrained in today’s politics and reflected frequently in Ferguson’s administration.
Exhibit 1
On Thursday and Friday this week, the National Governors Association convened a two-day Nuclear Energy Policy Retreat in the Washington state Capitol building. The association’s description of the program indicated the meetings would conclude “with a state strategic plan to pursue their Governor designated objectives” around nuclear policy.
There were panels on nuclear waste and the economics of nuclear power, among other topics. Representatives from the nuclear industry, utilities, companies like Amazon and Microsoft (which both have an interest in nuclear power for their data centers), and state agencies were all set to attend, according to the agenda.
A Friday session was moderated by Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, who is a Ferguson appointee, and featured state legislators and others.
State officials discussing the future of nuclear energy at the state Capitol. It seems like a matter of public interest. We inquired with Commerce and the governor’s office to see if the event would be open to press. And so began the runaround.
A Commerce spokesperson told us it was not and that she had no information about who at the state level helped organize the event where the agency’s leader was speaking. 
The spokesperson referred us to the governor’s office — not unexpected given Ferguson’s efforts to ensure responses from agencies to the press are routed through his staff.
The governor’s office deferred questions about press access to the National Governors Association, offered no assistance with gaining access, and ignored queries about who’d organized the event. Though they said the governor would not attend.
The National Governors Association, which gets money from taxpayer-funded dues that states pay, then denied us access. The group’s press secretary described the event — featuring an agency director, lawmakers, and more than 100 attendees, including some from the nation’s most powerful companies — as “a small group of state staff and specialists.”
Exhibit 2
When Ferguson’s office sent out its last schedule update for the governor, on Sept. 17, it showed a meeting this past Monday between him and the other eight statewide elected officials. We asked for information last week about what would be discussed and who would attend.
The governor’s office didn’t provide any, even though an agenda had been sent to those invited. After further follow-up, we got a short statement late Wednesday from the governor’s office summarizing the meeting.
It largely mirrored social media posts Ferguson made the next morning, complete with a glossy-looking photo of him speaking. He said the group discussed litigation, a new report “showing the devastation of Trump’s tariffs,” and protecting Washingtonians’ data from federal overreach.
“All of your statewide elected officials are working very hard to be extremely coordinated in dealing with what’s coming at us from Washington D.C.,” he wrote on X and Facebook.
Not mentioned in Ferguson’s recap are mounting state budget troubles that are not directly related to anything the federal government is doing.
We’d like to ask the governor about his views on the state’s fiscal health, like his positions on approving more tax increases in 2026, and some of the significant budget requests that have emerged this month from state agencies.
But he continues to shun interviews. So we’re stuck prying written statements from his communications staff — like the one he issued this week on the state’s weakening revenues, where he again focused on Trump.
As for the Monday meeting and Ferguson’s subsequent social media posts, it seems more like spectacle than governing, with the governor framing the sitdown in a way that underscores a core tenet of his political platform: He’s standing up to the president.
If it felt different in the room, we couldn’t tell you. The doors were closed to us.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/governors-office-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s 2026 Teacher of the Year said she’s excited to advocate for her profession and shine a light on challenges educators are facing.
“Sometimes we have the people who are the furthest away from the classroom making those classroom decisions with policy,” said Frannie Tunseth, a reading and math teacher from Mayville. “I think sometimes it’s on us educators to make sure we’re giving them better information as to what’s actually happening so they can make some better choices.”
Tunseth, who teaches at Mayville-Portland-Clifford-Galesburg Public School, was recognized Friday during a ceremony at the North Dakota Capitol. She was selected for the annual award out of 48 county Teacher of the Year candidates, which were narrowed down to four finalists.
“It feels so surreal to be honest,” Tunseth said after the ceremony. “Being up with all of these amazing educators is so inspiring. I’m almost awestruck.”

Tunseth works as a math and reading interventionist for grades 4-8, helping students struggling to keep up with their peers in those areas.
She said she hopes to promote more sustained professional development for teachers and wants to ensure that teachers have the ability to control their own classrooms without being constrained.
During the ceremony, North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler said Tunseth’s love for teaching was evident in her award application. She added the application included numerous letters of support and examples of how she supports students who struggle with learning. 
“Teachers have the opportunity to change the world by lifting up the next generation, and Mrs. Tunseth understands this as well as anyone,” Baesler said. “Mrs. Tunseth’s teaching is truly inspirational.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong called teaching “the most noble profession we have in North Dakota.”
“Nobody affects the future of North Dakota more than our teachers,” said Armstrong, who presented Tunseth with a personalized North Dakota license plate that reads “NDTOY26.” 
He added teachers like Tunseth are inspiring the next generation of law enforcement, doctors, accountants and other professions each community in the state relies on.
Tunseth previously taught in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, Grand Forks and Hillsboro and served as principal for three years at Griggs County Central School in Cooperstown.
She holds both bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of North Dakota and is expected to receive a doctorate in teaching in 2027, according to a Department of Public Instruction news release.

The companies suspended the program over remarks the comedian made in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing. 
The move means “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return to local TV on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates, including WTNH in Connecticut, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show. 
[RELATED: Protesters target WTNH over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension]
Disney-owned ABC suspended Kimmel on Sept. 17, following threats of potential repercussions from the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission. Sinclair also condemned the host — confirming that it would stop airing the show the same day.
The Maryland-based broadcast giant, which is known for conservative political content, called on Kimmel at the time to apologize to Kirk’s family — and taking it a step further, asked him to “make a meaningful personal donation” to Turning Point USA, the nonprofit that Kirk founded.
On the day Kirk was killed, Kimmel shared a message of support for Kirk’s family and other victims of gun violence on social media, which he reiterated during his Tuesday return to ABC. He had also called the conservative activist’s assassination a “senseless murder” prior to being taken off air.
Kimmel’s original comments didn’t otherwise focus on Kirk. He instead lambasted President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the killing. The comedian did not apologize on Tuesday, but did say “it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man” and acknowledged that to some, his comments “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”
He also used a blend of humor and pointed messages to emphasize the importance of free speech.
Even after Disney brought Kimmel back to its national airways, both Sinclair and Nexstar continued to preempt the show.
New episodes of the show air Monday through Thursday. Friday night’s rerun will be of Tuesday’s show — so viewers of Sinclair stations can see Kimmel’s emotional return to the air.
In its statement Friday, Sinclair pointed to its “responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming.”
The company, which operates 38 ABC-affiliated stations, added that it had received “thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives,” and noticed “troubling acts of violence,” referencing the shooting into the lobby of a Sacramento station.
“These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important,” Sinclair added.
As a result of Sinclair and Nexstar’s boycott, viewers in cities representing roughly a quarter of ABC’s local TV affiliates had been left without the late-night program on local TV. The blackouts escalated nationwide uproar around First Amendment protections — particularly as the Trump administration and other conservatives police speech after Kirk’s killing. They also cast a spotlight on political influence in the media landscape, with critics lambasting companies that they accuse of censoring content.
Ahead of his suspension, Kimmel took aim at the president and his “MAGA gang” of supporters for their response to Kirk’s killing, which Kimmel said included “finger-pointing” and attempts to characterize the alleged shooter as “anything other than one of them.”
These remarks angered many supporters of Kirk — as well as FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who accused Kimmel of appearing to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about the man accused of the killing. Ahead of Kimmel’s suspension, Carr warned that Disney and ABC’s local affiliates could face repercussions if the comedian was not punished.
He later applauded Sinclair, as well as Nexstar, for their decisions to preempt the show.
On Sept. 17, Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith called Kimmel’s comments “inappropriate and deeply insensitive” and said that ABC’s suspension wasn’t enough. Smith added that Sinclair appreciated Carr’s comments — and called for “immediate regulatory action” from the FCC “to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”
Still, in Friday’s announcement, Sinclair maintained that its decision to preempt Kimmel’s show was “independent of any government interaction or influence,” Sinclair’s statement Friday read, adding that broadcasters had the right to exercise their own judgment.
While local TV affiliates broadcast their own programming, such as local news, they also contract with larger national broadcasters — and pay them to air their national content, splitting advertising revenue and fees from cable companies.
Sinclair said “constructive” discussions with ABC were ongoing, and said its proposals to the network to strengthen accountability, feedback and dialogue and appoint an ombudsman had not yet been adopted.
Representatives for ABC declined to comment on Friday.
Matthew Dolgin, senior equity analyst at research firm Morningstar, said he wasn’t surprised by Sinclair’s decision.
“The relationship with Disney is far too important for these firms to risk,” Dolgin said. And setting aside legal rights from either side, he added, “Disney would’ve been free to take its affiliate agreements elsewhere in 2026 if these relationships were too difficult. That scenario would be devastating to Nexstar and Sinclair.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267236103074-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

And any agreement, they said, is likely weeks away.
Lawyers for a Calhoun County voter appeared before Judge Daniel Coble in a downtown Columbia courthouse Friday, asking the judge to temporarily block the South Carolina Election Commission from sharing the personal data of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters.

The U.S. Department of Justice last month asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
South Carolina voter Anne Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
“I’ll tell you what people are worried about,” Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is representing Crook, told the judge.
“They’re worried the DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to give it to DOGE. They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and they’re going to create a national database,” said the Orangeburg Democrat. “They’re worried DOJ is going to get this and give it to Homeland Security.”
Lawyers for the Election Commission argued there was no need for a temporary injunction blocking the information’s release because state law bars the agency from sharing it without an agreement in place.
Lawyers for Gov. Henry McMaster went further, asking the judge to throw the suit out altogether.
SC elections agency faces ongoing legal challenges over voter rolls amid directors’ firings

South Carolina already swaps voter information with other states, though that does not include driver’s license numbers, said Elizabeth Crum, an attorney for the Election Commission.
In all, the state shares its information with 32 states and Washington, D.C., election agency spokesman John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette.
Most of that goes through a partnership organization known as Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). The ERIC partners include both Democratic and Republican leaning states.
South Carolina also has freestanding agreements with Virginia, Ohio, and most recently, a nine-state agreement led by Texas.
And it has previously shared information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Crum said in response to a question from the judge.

That information was used by DHS as part of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, which is related to immigration. The Election Commission did not immediately provide details about when and what data was shared as part of that program.
Crum pointed to those agreements as examples of how the state plans to approach any agreement with the federal Justice Department.
“They say what the purpose is that they’re used for. It also says who has access to them. It says how they’re transmitted,” she said. “And there are several other security requirements in each of them.”
“There is no reason to believe and every reason to be assured that the Election Commission is not going to share anyone’s data unless and until they have a (memorandum of understanding) that protects the security of confidential information,” Crum added.

Acting agency director Jennifer Wooten testified the Election Commission expects the Justice Department to send a draft of the agreement in the next few weeks. The two agencies will then negotiate further on what the final document includes.
Crum also told the judge the Election Commission will hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed agreement before voting on whether to approve it.
In arguing that the case should be thrown out altogether, Grayson Lambert, the governor’s lawyer, said it’s the constitutional right of the federal government to regulate federal elections.
Because the state does not maintain separate state and federal voter rolls, he said, the federal government has a legitimate reason for wanting access to the information.
Hutto commended the Election Commission for making its assurances.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

“We all want safe elections,” he said. “We all want fair elections. We don’t want any fraud in elections.
If DOJ has the purest intention of using this information only for the security of the voter database, I don’t know that anybody objects to that,” he continued. “They have failed to say that. They will not answer that question.”
For that reason, Hutto said his client asked the judge to “maintain the status quo until such time as these assurances are in place, so that she can have the comfort and everybody in South Carolina can have comfort that their personal identifying information is protected from misuse and abuse.”

(Photo via Google Earth)A second group of Keokuk residents have filed a potential class-action lawsuit against a corn-processing plant in the city, claiming noxious odors from the plant have created a public nuisance.
The lawsuit, filed this week in federal court, is the second of its type to be filed against Roquette America, a corn syrup and corn starch producer.
In June, two individuals who own property within 1,000 feet the plant, David M. Dye and Steve L. Andrews, sued the company and claimed they’ve been damaged by a “significant” increase in odors emanating from the site. That lawsuit is still pending.

The new lawsuit, based on similar claims, has been filed on behalf of two other Keokuk residents, Anne-Marie Helenthal and Debra Hunter.
The two lawsuits allege the plant features a wastewater treatment system to treat corn-processing byproducts and industrial waste, and that the company has failed to install, maintain and operate adequate odor mitigating strategies.
“The foul odors emitted from the defendant’s facility are offensive, would be offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary health and sensibilities, and have caused property damage,” the newly filed lawsuit claims.
The lawsuits have yet to be granted class-action status, but the most recent filing quotes putative class members Lana and John Jefferson as saying the smell “sometimes gets so thick in the air you almost puke,” and that despite building a new porch to sit outside they sometimes “just go back in ’cause of the smell and noise,” leaving them feeling trapped in their own home.
Court records indicate the plant was built about 122 years ago. However, the wastewater treatment facility on the site wasn’t constructed until 1977. In 1991, Roquette purchased the plant, and in 2013, Roquette allegedly began expanding its wastewater treatment system. According to court records, Roquette created an “overflow tank” in 2023 that resulted in a near-constant “foul and offensive odor” once it became operational.
The lawsuits allege the plant’s wastewater treatment is subject to separation-distance requirements that legally restrict its operations if there are habitable structures within 1,000 feet of the plant, unless a waiver has been signed by the nearby landowners.
Dye and Andrews claim they don’t recall signing any such waiver. “The odor far exceeds any typical normal operating procedural smells,” their lawsuit claims, adding that the smell is so severe that Dye and Andrews have had to leave their homes and stay in hotels, avoid using air conditioning or heating in order to prevent outside air from entering their homes, and avoid outdoor activities at home.
The odor, they allege, “contains harmful gases” that endanger their physical and mental health.
Federal records show that in October 2024, Roquette agreed to pay $207,488 in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Keokuk plant. The company also agreed to donate emergency response vehicles to the Keokuk Fire Department as part of the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the EPA, the company stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, on site and failed to comply with regulations intended to protect the surrounding community from accidental releases.
In addition, the lawsuits claim, Roquette previously entered into a consent decree with the EPA over alleged violations at the plant.
The lawsuits allege negligence in the construction and use of the plant; the creation of a nuisance that has deposited silt upon homes and vehicles and destroyed vegetation; and trespassing in the form of air contaminants that have “physically invaded” the plaintiffs’ property.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as an injunction permanently barring Roquette from diverting odor onto the plaintiffs’ property or interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their property.
An attorney for Roquette America has declined to comment on the litigation, but in response to the lawsuit filed in June, the company denied any wrongdoing and asserted that it “operates as a reasonable corn milling plant” that is “currently in compliance with all applicable permits.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — Kansas hospital leaders sent a letter to the state’s congressional delegation urging members to extend premium tax credits for those who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.
Republicans in Congress, including the state’s two senators and three of the four House members, stripped the tax credits from low-income families as part of a tax and spending bill earlier this year. As the federal government approaches a possible shutdown next week, Democrats are refusing to support a short-term spending plan unless Republicans make the tax credits permanent.
Health care providers say the loss of tax credits will especially hurt families and hospitals in rural parts of the state.
“The reality is that for a rural hospital like ours, every dollar counts,” said Preston Sayers, CEO of Kingman Healthcare Center. “A failure to extend the tax credits will cause Kansans to lose their coverage, and they often won’t qualify for Medicaid. This will lead to a surge in uncompensated care and make it even more difficult to keep our doors open and provide the care our communities depend on.”
More than 160,000 Kansans benefit from the tax credits that are expected to expire. They can expect to see a 77% increase in premiums.
That means a hike of $2,500 per year for a family earning $64,000 per year, or $18,000 for a 60-year-old couple making $82,800 per year, according to a news release from Ascension Via Christi, which operates hospitals in Wichita.
“As health care providers on the front lines of patient care, we know firsthand the devastating impact that a loss of affordable coverage would have on our communities,” said Kevin Strecker, CEO of Ascension Via Christi. “This is a direct threat to the financial well-being of Kansas families and the stability of our health care system, particularly our rural hospitals, which serve as a lifeline for their communities.”
In the letter sent Thursday to all six members of the state’s congressional delegation, the hospital leaders said as Kansans lose coverage, hospitals will face rising costs from uncompensated care. The letter was sent to Republican Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, and Republican Reps. Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Tracey Mann.
It was signed by leaders of Ascension Via Christi, Caldwell Regional Medical Center, Children’s Mercy Kansas City, Greenwood County Hospital, Hillsboro Community Hospital, Kingman Healthcare Center, NMC Health in Newton, Patterson Health Center in Anthony, Salina Regional Health Center and Wesley Healthcare.
“Allowing the premium tax cuts to expire will directly affect our ability as a rural health care provider to care for the community where we live, work and serve,” said Vallerie Gleason, President and CEO of NMC Health. “I urge our Kansas congressional delegation, who care deeply about rural Kansas and rural hospitals, to support extensions of the premium tax cuts.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Ron DeSantis holds a 287(g) check alongside Attorney General James Uthmeier, FHP director Dave Kerner and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan on Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has begun to reimburse Florida law enforcement for acting as federal immigration enforcement by arresting and detaining undocumented immigrants.
And though they presented Gov. Ron DeSantis Friday with hefty checks signed by President Donald Trump totaling more than $38.4 million for transportation and equipment costs, the federal government has yet to cover the at-minimum $245 million price tag for the Everglades detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The clock is ticking. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it will award the grant Florida requested weeks ago by Tuesday, Sept. 30 — now just five days away.
But DeSantis isn’t worried.
“What I said from the beginning on this is we will get reimbursed eventually,” he said at a press conference Friday afternoon, standing alongside ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. 
“I saw [White House Border Czar] Tom Homan the other day and he’s just like, ‘Send us your reimbursements. We got a lot of money now, we want to help you guys.’ So that’ll happen,” the governor continued.
He added that the only people detained at the site are “military-aged males,” and that the “cadence” of deportation flights out of the “Deportation Depot” center in Baker County is going so well, the state will be up to five flights per week starting next week. 
The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) applied to be federally reimbursed for the Everglades site sometime in mid-September. The timing is iffy, although the Florida Phoenix confirmed it happened shortly after a federal appeals court ruled that a federal environmental law did not apply to the facility — keeping it open — because it hadn’t received federal dollars.
Less than eight days later, FDEM asked for federal reimbursement. The money, if approved, would come from FEMA’s new Detention Support Grant Program, which has roughly $608.4 million in its coffers. 
ICE’s $1.7B state partnership push
On Friday, DeSantis spoke from the Florida Sheriffs Association building alongside law enforcement, ICE officials, and Uthmeier, who brainstormed Everglades site in mid-June alongside the Department of Homeland Security.
ICE announced that $1.7 billion will go to various states with ICE partnerships, called 287(g) agreements. This money will fund the costs of equipment needed to transport undocumented migrants. Florida accounts for $38.4 million of that total, or roughly 2.26%.
$28.4 million will go to state law enforcement and $10 million to local law enforcement. The overall breakdown is $2.7 million in transportation funding for local agencies, $7.3 million in equipment funding for 974 local officers, $1 million in transportation funding for state agencies, and $27.5 million for 3,676 state officers.
These are all officers or agencies that have entered into a 287(g) agreement, which deputizes state and local law enforcement as federal immigration actors and empowers them to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.
Florida mandated all counties and all county sheriffs to sign 287(g) agreements through a controversial new law in February. Lawsuits immediately began to crop up, one of which included a federal judge blocking officers from making these arrests. Uthmeier, who instructed law enforcement to do so anyways, was held in civil contempt (though it was later overturned).
That case has ping-ponged to a federal appellate court, to the Florida Supreme Court, and is now back in the appellate court pending oral arguments in October. Other cases included the city of South Miami questioning whether cities must enter into 287(g) agreements, Democrats arguing humanitarian violations at the Everglades site, and environmental groups trying to shut down that facility over concerns of harming the Everglades.
“Our state agencies are going to be reimbursed,” DeSantis assured Friday. “Some people tried to say that wasn’t gonna happen, and I think today with these checks, this is just the beginning.”

In a ruling earlier this week, the panel of three appellate judges said that Gabriel Metcalf’s conviction should be overturned because he offered a plausible interpretation and understanding of federal gun law, even while acknowledging that federal district court judge Susan Watters had a more straightforward and traditional definition of the law.
The majority opinion, written by Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, a former Montana Solicitor General, noted that Metcalf appears to be the only person to test whether Montana’s open carry gun law complied with the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. In his appeal, Metcalf also raised concerns that his conviction also violated his Second Amendment rights, but the appellate court stopped short of deciding that issue, ruling instead that Metcalf’s interpretation of the law was plausible, and therefore he could not have known he was violating federal law.
Judge Mary M. Schroeder issued a dissenting opinion in the case, saying that VanDyke and Judge John B. Owens had reached their conclusion “by means of a tortured application” of judicial principles, even while acknowledging that Watters had the better and more traditional interpretation of state and federal law.
VanDyke was appointed by President Donald J. Trump to the appellate court during Trump’s first term, and before that served as Assistant Solicitor General for Texas, Solicitor General of Montana and Solicitor General of Nevada. Owens was appointed by President Barack Obama.
However, VanDyke, writing the majority opinion, said that because Metcalf had provided a “plausible” reading of the law, and that there was no case law that could have possibly helped him understand the nuances of Montana’s gun laws and how they interact with federal law, the court was obligated to overturn the conviction.
“Our decision is a narrow one,” the ruling said. “Metcalf was the first, and to our knowledge, only person in Montana to have raised the license exception in response to a charge for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.”
  Scaring kids vs. verifying eligibility 

Metcalf lived across the street from Broadwater Elementary, which sits on the busy thoroughfare of Broadwater Avenue in the heart of Billings.
Residents and school leaders, as well as local law enforcement, had become alarmed when they saw Metcalf “patrolling” the neighborhood with guns, just across the street from the school’s playground.
Billings Police officers had been dispatched many times to talk with Metcalf, but concluded that state law offered no remedy. Still, school officials for a time abandoned part of the playground, moving students to the back side of the building and putting a black tarp up that blocked the view of the elementary students as a precaution.
Meanwhile, Metcalf claimed that a former neighbor, since convicted of felony, had been harassing he and his mother with whom he lived, and that he was simply patrolling his property, defending himself and protecting his mother whom he walked to work and back. Metcalf’s mother had a restraining order in place against this former neighbor, and court records confirm that the man had indeed been actively bothering Metcalf and his mother.
Metcalf had grown so weary of visits by local law enforcement that he called federal authorities to report that his Second Amendment Rights had been violated. However, officers with the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agency instead found that he was violating federal law by carrying a gun in a gun-free school zone.

But the appeals court in its review noted that Montana’s gun law was unique and ambiguous. While state law allows a person who has not been convicted of violent felony to carry a gun in a gun-free school zone, the state law also says that the person must be “verified.” However, Montana doesn’t specify a verification process or a special licensing process; instead, the Legislature has granted broad gun rights to all citizens who haven’t been convicted of a violent felony.
“The Montana Legislature has made clear that it enacted its state license to comply with federal law, and it did so by directly licensing individuals by statute, rather than by delegating authority to separate state or local agencies,” the ruling said. “Because Congress did not make a clear statement prohibiting Montana’s decision to act, the legislature, rather than through delegated authority other than state officials, Metcalf’s proffered interpretation finds support.”
However, the appeals court also noted that Watters may have correctly determined that Montana’s gun carrying laws may not comport with the federal gun-free zone act. It also said that there was no way — no case law — that Metcalf could have relied upon to make that determination.
“Per the district court, ‘Montana Individual Licensure does not meet this requirement because it automatically considers every person in the state to be licensed then claws back licensure from those who have committed violent felonies or are disqualified by the Montana Constitution,’” the decision said.
But because of the law’s ambiguity, the appellate court found Metcalf could not have known what was lawful.
“Both the government and the district court seemed to equate the act of ‘verifying’ with conducting an individualized background (or qualifications) check,” the court’s opinion said. “A background check is certainly one way of verifying that an individual is qualified to hold a license. But, it is not the only way of doing it.”
While the district court judge found that Metcalf had not been verified to carry a gun in the area, Metcalf’s belief that he didn’t need to go through a formal process was “plausible.”
“Metcalf lacked the appropriate notice to be convicted of violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act. Affirming Metcalf’s conviction would be inconsistent with the principles of fair notice and of not punishing innocent conduct,” the appeals court ruled.
Schroeder, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, balked at the other two judge’s conclusions, saying they adopted the judge’s reasoning as a correct and the more credible interpretation, but twisted the law to favor Metcalf.
“The majority stretches these principles in Metcalf’s case because it apparently views him to be a sympathetic person who has been unjustly treated,” she said. The result leaves him free to pick up arms and continue to frighten the neighbors, that include the school across the street.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-7188-scaled-e1733786147380-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY —  Oklahoma’s mental health department hasn’t met the required benchmarks of a consent decree settling a 2023 lawsuit, according to a report published Friday. 
The agency has produced “incomplete and internally conflicting” data, submitted plans missing essential information, and has not demonstrated “true urgency” in dealing with the consent decree, the report found.
While the leadership of recently appointed Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic has led to a “new approach” to the consent decree, “hard work and good efforts do not necessarily equate to best efforts,” the report written by a team of court-appointed consultants found. 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has made improvements in its communication with consultants, workplace culture, leadership and on some of the benchmarks, according to the report. 
The landmark consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. 
It’s expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. Failure to comply could result in financial penalties. 
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said the agency continues to work closely with the court-appointed consultants and values their guidance. 
“We appreciate the consultant’s recognition of our progress,” she said in a statement Friday. “Change of this scale doesn’t happen overnight, but the court consultants’ advice has been crucial to our progress. (The Mental Health Department) is working to implement all recommendations and is committed to satisfying the best efforts requirement of the consent decree.”
The report revealed inconsistencies in data and a lack of a carefully considered plan to carry out the consent decree. For example, the consultants wrote they received conflicting reports of how many people are currently awaiting competency restoration services and the average time spent on a waitlist. 
The consultants said the agency failed to meet benchmarks across multiple categories, which could result in either financial or injunctive remedies. 
They offered guidance for the issues throughout the report and said financial penalties will only be incurred in this instance if other “recommendations and deliverables are not first satisfied.”
“While we offer no excuses for (the Mental Health Department), we also believe that the Department’s administrative forensic service continues to operate with a shoestring staff and limited funding,” the consultants writing the report wrote. “Important changes have occurred, but the Department needs more resources, including a senior official in charge of the Decree with exclusive responsibility for its implementation, as well as the infusion of additional funding for staff salaries, new hires, and additional resources.” 
Slavonic’s leadership has created a new “tone” within the agency that allows for staff to work more freely with the consultants and steps have been taken to change critical leadership, the report found. But the Mental Health Department is still far behind in its efforts to comply with the consent decree, the report said. 
Allie Friesen, the former commissioner, was originally tasked with carrying out the terms of the consent decree and was named in the lawsuit. Friesen was fired by state lawmakers in May following weeks of uncertainty about the agency’s finances. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the report was “alarming” and it will take “tremendous effort” to get the agency on track with the consent decree’s required timeline. 
“The consent decree that my office helped broker will save the state untold millions of dollars, but it is critical that the Department of Mental Health actually comply with the plan,” he said in a statement.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state heath insurance plan is going to help members who use Duke doctors find alternative medical providers, as protracted negotiations over payments drag on. 
Duke Health and Aetna, the health plan’s third-party administrator, have been locked in negotiations for months. The contract between Aetna and Duke Health expires Oct. 20. State Health Plan trustees approved a resolution Friday that will have offer “white-glove service” to beneficiaries who use Duke in helping them find new doctors.
Aetna insures about 1.5 million North Carolina residents, including about 750,000 through the state employee health plan. If there’s no agreement by Oct. 20, Duke Health will no longer be part of Aetna’s provider network, and most patients who continue to see its doctors will pay higher costs. That means thousands of state employees and teachers would pay higher medical bills if they remain Duke patients. 
Adopting a contingency plan is unprecedented move, and state Treasurer Brad Briner said he is holding out hope for an agreement by the contract deadline. 
“If we end up out of network, Duke is the one who made that choice,” he said. “They will have made that choice that their financial goals are more important than their mission to serve.”
He criticized what he called Duke’s “aggressive tactics” – radio ads and letters to beneficiaries – which he said were meant to scare them and convince them to argue on the health system’s behalf. 
Briner said the public pressure campaign was beneath one of the state’s preeminent non-profit hospitals. 
In a prepared statement, Duke Health said it is continuing good-faith negotiations with Aetna to ensure patients covered under the insurer’s plans can continue uninterrupted access to Duke primary care doctors and specialists. 
“We have a responsibility to our patients to communicate about potential impacts to Duke Health care access,” said the statement attributed to Duke Health officials.  “They may need more time than the required notice period allows. We’ve sent communications to our patients to provide them with context on the negotiations, continuity of care and how they can provide feedback to both negotiating parties, Duke Health and Aetna.”
Despite rising costs, Duke Health has not received a rate adjustment from Aetna in four years, the statement said, adding that the increases it is requesting are below the rate of inflation. 
“We recognize and understand the pressures facing the State Health Plan,” the statement said. ”Less than 6% of State Health Plan members receive care at Duke Health and the modest increases we’re seeking from Aetna would have minimal to no effect on premiums.”
The 22,000 people on the state health plan and who have a Duke primary care doctor, and about 40,000 members who have filed a claim through Duke this year will be contacted about finding new medical providers. 
About 2,800 people on state health insurance who use Duke Health for treatments are protected under the continuity of care law. They will be able to continue to use Duke Health as an in-network provider after the contract expires, but need to fill out paperwork. These are mostly patients receiving maternity care or cancer treatments.
Duke Health came under blistering criticism from Dr. Brian Miller, a health plan trustee, who recited figures from Duke Health’s financial audits, and noted its $4.3 billion in investments. 
“This does not sound like a health system that is in financial distress,” he said. “Duke is choosing to prioritize its investment portfolio instead of the heath of local citizens who work as custodians, help take care of parks, local teachers. They would rather pad their investment portfolio off the backs of these workers. I find that a fundamental moral failure, and I am sincerely disappointed.”
Health Plan Executive Director Tom Friedman said after the trustees meeting that the plan asked every provider to either hold the line on costs or even take less next year as the plan moved to close its financial hole. It cannot now give one provider a lot more after asking others to sacrifice, he said. 
“How are we going to look them straight in the eye and say ‘Yes, this was fair,” Friedman said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4769-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Wyoming’s public records ombudsman is trying to get the word out about a task force that seeks to improve the law that gives citizens access to government work.
The post Little public notice of Monday’s critical public meeting regarding Public Records Act appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s public records ombudsman says there’s been little public notice of a public meeting regarding the Public Records Act scheduled for Monday, and she’s trying to get the word out.
An appointee in Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, Darlena Potter, agreed to chair a legislative committee’s working group on Monday to hash out changes to the law. The goal is to make improvements sought by the public, state and local agencies and governments — changes that could be adopted by the Legislature in early 2026.
But lacking the official status that would allow her working group the public-notice resources and reach of the Legislative Service Office, Potter is scrambling to let policy wonks, reporters and even the odd town-council gadfly a chance to weigh in.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used.” Darlena Potter
Public records requests have increased significantly in recent years, Potter said.
“A lot of folks are requesting things such as how their local entities’ monies are being used,” she said. Citizens are “trying to get a grasp on the transparency issue of what sort of items their taxpayer dollars are going towards.”
She called the increase in public records requests “a huge shift, which is kind of encouraging.”
Citizens are trying to educate themselves, she said, but “they’ve run into a few hurdles.”
The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions that considered two draft bills at its Aug. 14 meeting also encountered bumps. Scheduled for an hour and 45 minutes of discussion, the public records deliberation lasted more than five hours before lawmakers assigned Potter the task of shaking things out through a working group.
The group will meet for the first time at 10 a.m. Monday in Room W-113 of the Wyoming Capitol. People can participate remotely through this Zoom link.
‘Any information…’
A public record is “any information in a physical form created, accepted, or obtained by a governmental entity in furtherance of its official function and transaction of public business,” according to the law. Wyoming Statute 16-4-201 through 205 requires that “all public records shall be open for inspection by any person,” with some obvious exceptions for privacy reasons. Records custodians can charge a reasonable fee for copies.
Three topics are foremost among Potter’s worries. One is the timeline for responding to and delivering public records sought through a request.
“Currently, the statute mandates a seven business-day acknowledgment of a public records request and production of documents within 30 calendar days,” Potter wrote in a memo. One proposal suggests a three-day acknowledgment and 10 calendar day production of documents, but that framework remains under debate.
Another issue is the cost of obtaining copies of public records. Because laws prevent some private information from being released, some requests require costly review by lawyers.
“There was some discussion of standardizing these,” Potter said of the August committee meeting discussion. “Some areas of the state are more expensive than others to produce the same types of documentation and, in the state statute, it just says ‘reasonable’ [fees].”
Finally, there’s the issue of data mining. Potter said she’s seeing lots of requests from out-of-state entities for a large volume of information.
Consider, for example, all the gear companies and outfitters who might want a list of addresses of the holders of Wyoming elk licenses. Imagine an entrepreneur’s 2025 pitch: “Want to buy a corner-crossing ladder?”People who want to learn more about the corporations committee’s struggles and draft legislation can access meeting materials and a recording of the August session on the LSO website.

In addition to sunsetting a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Sept. 25, 2025.
This week, Catamount Solar technicians are expected to power up Randolph’s Community Solar 2 project, a recently completed, net-metering array on Beanville Road that may be the last of its kind in Vermont, at least for a while.
The future of such arrays, wherein community members buy shares and reap a reduced electric bill for years to come, has taken a hit from the state. Vermont no longer allows new group net-metering projects.
“We had to really hustle because after December 31, just passed, there were going to be no more permits approved,” said Jerry Ward, a retired physician who serves as the lead community organizer on CS2. “So we, in December, got that permit filed. And as of now, there will be nothing like this again until the law changes again.”
Still, during a visit to the CS2 site last Friday, the mood was celebratory.
“It’s definitely an exciting moment,” said Kevin McCollister, co-founder of Catamount Solar, as he walked down to the array, checking to make sure Green Mountain Power had delivered a meter.
GMP had, “so now we’ll get our guys back here to commission it.”

McCollister explained the basics of what’s next: the array will be turned on and start making power, and the credits from the power will be shared among the project’s subscribers according to the number of shares that they purchased.
CS2, a member-owned LLC, has 22 subscribers from the greater Randolph area. Typically an array of this size — it consists of 324 solar panels — benefits about 25 average households, Ward explained, but a few of CS2’s members are “pretty big.”
Ward and McCollister noted two more entities who will benefit from the array. Thanks to two anonymous shareholders, one in Brookfield and one in Royalton, the food shelves in Randolph and South Royalton will receive renewable energy credits on their utility bills.
The cost of buying into CS2, for an average household — about 4% of the array — is about $25,000, said Ward.
“It’d be about like buying it (for) your roof, a little bit cheaper.”
Over the first year, shareholders can expect to save about $172 per kilowatt; a 5-kW share would amount to savings of about $860 a year.
CS2 takes up about three-quarters of an acre on a 1.5-acre patch of land owned by Matt and Sarah Murawski on Beanville Road. CS1, Randolph’s first community solar project, on South Randolph Road, was developed about 10 years ago.
Completion of CS2 comes at a time when the federal government is darkening the future of solar, with energy policies that push costs higher for consumers.
In addition to a 30% residential solar tax credit for homeowners going away at the end of this year, the Trump administration has terminated investment tax credits for clean energy technologies — with various effective dates — and ordered the Internal Revenue Service to revise a safe-harbor provision that would have protected some project timelines for clean energy developers.
“What we’re seeing on the federal level is atrocious,” said McCollister, who is set to retire later this year. “It’s terrible, for so many reasons and on so many levels. And for whatever reason, this administration really doesn’t like renewables, especially wind and solar, and they’re really trying to do everything they can to stop it.”
While expressing his dismay over federal actions, McCollister noted that solar is not going away, “especially in Vermont,” where “people understand that it’s important.
“We need to do something. People want to do something to address climate change. It’s something that’s very practical that individuals and homeowners can do to make a difference. And on top of it, our electricity rates are only going up,” he said, noting that, historically, GMP had about 3 to 3.5% rate increases annually.
This year, the rate increase is 7.4%.
“There’s a clear trend (that) rates are going up faster than we’re used to. The national policies are only going to increase that trend, I believe, which makes solar a really viable option. It’s going to remain being a good investment for people.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Air National Guard/Master Sgt. Megan Floyd)COLUMBIA — The state is under a state of emergency as a so far-unnamed tropical disturbance potentially heads toward the coast, Gov. Henry McMaster declared Friday.
A state of emergency frees up the resources and state employees to prepare for the possibility of landfall, along with allowing state and local authorities to apply for federal emergency reimbursements if needed, according to a news release.
It also triggered the state’s anti-price-gouging law.
Meteorologists are predicting a 90% chance the disturbance, designated Friday as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, will become a tropical storm over the weekend. If that happens, the disturbance will be named Imelda.
South Carolina residents, especially along the coast, should prepare for high winds, potentially causing power outages, along with heavy rainfall and storm surge early next week, according to the National Weather Service.
“While the storm’s arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,” McMaster said in a news release. “We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations.”
The disturbance’s path remains uncertain, according to a mid-day National Weather Service briefing. The system could strike the Carolinas early next week or linger just over the ocean near South Carolina, dumping rain on coastal cities, meteorologists wrote.
Or, the disturbance could approach the coast before veering back out to sea, like Hurricane Humberto, another approaching storm, is expected to do.
The proximity of the two storms is part of the reason for uncertainty.
Meteorologists are unsure whether the two might collide, forming another system, or send each other spinning off onto different courses, according to the briefing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/8574450-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

(File photo NC Newsline)  Former North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse will oversee county boards of elections in a new role with the State Auditor’s Office, Auditor Dave Boliek announced in an email to county board chairs.
“To assist in your efforts to ensure election integrity while encouraging maximum participation in our elections, I have appointed Dallas Woodhouse as my liaison to the local and state board of elections,” Boliek wrote. “Mr. Woodhouse will serve as my eyes and ears on the ground in our elections process.”
Woodhouse’s responsibilities as election liaison, a new role in the auditor’s office, will include shaping early voting plans, election policy, and oversight, according to the email. He declined to comment, referring the request to a spokesperson for Boliek.
He served as executive director for the state GOP from 2015 to 2019, after which he held roles in the John Locke Foundation and the Civitas Institute, prominent right-leaning think tanks in the state. Woodhouse has served as North Carolina executive director of American Majority, a conservative training nonprofit, since 2023.
Randy Brechbiel, a spokesperson for the state auditor, wrote in a statement that “election liaison is his current and only role,” indicating he would not continue to work for the nonprofit. He wrote that Woodhouse will focus on efforts to “ensure election integrity” and support “maximum participation in elections.”
Gerry Cohen, a member of the Wake County Board of Elections, said he spoke with Woodhouse soon after the announcement and believes he is “serious about it” and “has the knowledge base to perform the role,” though added that “doesn’t mean I agree with everything.”
“I’ve known Dallas for like 15 years or so and had a good working relationship with him, and I think it’s good to have somebody who knows something about elections in the process,” he said.
In his role with the state GOP, Woodhouse pushed GOP county board members to limit early voting to deter same-day registration, eliminate Sunday voting and block early voting sites on college campuses.
“We believe same-day registration is ripe with voter fraud, or the opportunity to commit it,” Woodhouse wrote in a 2016 memo. “Same-day registration is only available during early voting. We are under no obligation to offer more opportunities for voter fraud.”
Ahead of the 2024 election, Woodhouse voiced greater openness for early voting, urging conservatives to “vote as soon as possible or be prepared to lose” in a column for The Carolina Journal. He said he planned to complete his own mail-in ballot at the earliest opportunity.
Cohen cautioned against reading into statements Woodhouse made as a party official.
“I just wouldn’t assume that positions that Dallas took 10 years ago when he was executive director of the state Republican Party, I would not assume that has anything to do with how he will handle this job working for the state government assisting in administration of elections,” he said.

Thanks to a federal judge’s order, the 27-year-old DACA recipient was released Wednesday from the Otero County Processing Center in New Mexico. (Courtesy ACLU-NM)A federal judge in New Mexico this week ordered the release of a 27-year-old man held in federal immigration detention in Chaparral for 42 days, a detention that occurred even though he had previously received a federal promise of deferred deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira at his home in Horizon City, Texas on Aug. 13, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. Agents then took Gamez Lira to the Otero County Processing Center in Southern New Mexico, where he was held until Wednesday.
Gamez Lira has lived in the United States since infancy, according to the ACLU, and he successfully secured Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status after President Barack Obama signed an executive order granting deportation protections in 2012. Gamez Lira, a father of four who works as a forklift driver, had valid DACA status when ICE agents detained him, according to the ACLU.

The civil rights group and private law-firm Singleton Schreiber, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence, sued Sept. 3 in federal court, alleging Gamez Lira’s constitutional rights were being violated. 
In response, acting United States Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison said the government did not oppose Gamez Lira’s release, according to a Wednesday court filing, though he wrote that the government’s lack of opposition to his release does mean it accepts factual or legal allegations his lawyers made in the lawsuit. 
Shortly after Ellison’s filing, federal judge William P. Johnson ordered Gamez Lira’s immediate release Wednesday. 
“This has been the most difficult time of our lives, but we never lost hope that justice would prevail,” said Alejandra Gamez Lira, the detainee’s wife, in a statement provided by the ACLU. 
ICE previously declined to comment about the lawsuit in a statement to Source New Mexico, citing the federal litigation. 
Gamez Lira’s lawyers celebrated his release and criticized ICE for arresting a DACA recipient. 
“This case shows that the government absolutely should refrain from detaining DACA recipients, and we are grateful that swift legal action here has resulted in Paulo being reunited with his loved ones,” said Becca Sheff, a lawyer with the ACLU-NM, in a statement.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/whatsapp_image_2025-09-02_at_5.27.41_pm_5-e1758921002646.jpg,,,2025-09-26 17:57:21.539298

Ron DeSantis (right), Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees (at the podium), then-Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, (left) and then-Deputy Secretary for Health Shamarial Roberson (far left). (Photo by Issac Morgan/Florida Phoenix)Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo has dismissed concerns that not enough research was done before he and Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last month that they intend to dismantle school vaccine mandates, saying this is an issue of “parents’ rights.”
But his predecessor — Dr. Scott Rivkees — says the matter has “nothing” to do with parental rights.
“This is part of an organized strategy to undermine vaccinations in Florida,” said Rivkees, who was Florida’s surgeon general from 2019-2021.
“This is a string of different policies and different statements that [Dr. Ladapo] has made to undermine vaccination. As far as this notion about personal freedom, I get that. But on the other hand, we can talk about personal freedom for one group of individuals who actually will impinge on the personal freedom of other individuals,” he continued.
“If we don’t have enough population protection, which means vaccinating children, individuals who may be immunocompromised, people who have been treated for cancer, people who are older, they’re actually going to have their rights and liberties trampled on by not being able to go out in public when outbreaks occur.”
Speaking on WMNF 88.5 FM radio to a Phoenix reporter on Friday, Rivkees, now a professor of medicine at Brown University, said the proposal offered by Ladapo and DeSantis to make Florida the first state in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements “is a predetermined ideology that is not based on science.”
“Vaccines have prevented hundreds of millions of deaths. For vaccinations to work, you need two things to happen: Parents need to vaccinate their children. But also, because some individuals vaccines are not 100% effective — you know, people are immunocompromised — people [who] have cancer are also dependent upon other people being vaccinated for their children so that we have population safety.”
mRNA vaccines
Speaking on a podcast called “On Call” with Houston physician Dr. Mary Talley Bowden earlier this month, Dr. Ladapo said he didn’t want mRNA Covid-19 vaccines available in the state. “The goal with the mRNA is for that not to be available to anyone, because no one should be using that one,” he said.
If Ladapo wants to rid the state of mRNA vaccines, he should provide other options, Rivkees said.
“Last year, Dr. Ladapo said no one should have mRNA vaccines but did not propose any alternatives for people. What are they going to do instead?” he asked, adding that the opposition to mRNA vaccines makes no sense.
“This is something that has been looked at extensively,” he said. “There’ve been just under a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines that have been given in the U.S. They’ve been incredibly effective. … The notion that they get into the human genome [and] affect our genes is absolutely not true. So, these are vaccines that are safe. They’re effective. During the pandemic they are estimated to have saved anywhere between two and three million lives.”
Ladapo already has the power to remove some vaccine requirements by simple rule changes. That means that starting in early December (taking effect 90 days after the Sept. 3 announcement) school vaccinations will no longer be required for hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type b (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate virus. That’s according to a statement sent by the Florida Department of Health that was reported by ABC News.
Others, however, including poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella are still in place and won’t be removed unless the Legislature opts to do so when it convenes for its 2026 session in January.
Rivkees was a practicing pediatric endocrinologist and working as a professor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine when the governor picked him to lead the Florida Department of Health and serve as surgeon general in April 2021. He had also served as associate chair of pediatrics for research at the Yale University School of Medicine and was on the faculty at Harvard Medical School.
In his first year as surgeon general, Rivkees declared a public health emergency and encouraged vaccinations in Florida after more than 2,000 cases of Hepatitis A were registered in the state. He then led the efforts to vaccinate more than 200,000 people against the virus.
DeSantis ‘pivot’ on vaccines
When COVID-19 emerged early in 2020, Rivkees led the effort once the mRNA vaccine was available to administer. Florida had one of highest vaccination rates against the novel coronavirus and lowest death rates per capita in the country because the governor “embraced Covid vaccines,” he said.
“There was a major pivot by Gov. DeSantis about halfway through the pandemic,” he now says.
“We went to a situation where all of a sudden he stopped supporting vaccines. Vaccination rates fell and then, when the Delta wave hit in the summer of 2021, Florida went from having among the best vaccination rates and lowest mortality rates to among the worst. We see the painful consequences of changes in these policies.
“Being a pediatrician, having seen severe cases of childhood meningitis, chicken pox, hepatitis B, it breaks my heart that again we can be relieving these horrible diseases that cause so much harm to children and are vaccine preventable. “
A survey of 631 registered Florida voters conducted by Bendixen & Amandi International taken Sept. 7-9 found that 60% opposed ending vaccine mandates and just 37% supporting it.

A new report ranks states on extreme weather and air quality risks.
(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine have the best combination of relatively low environmental risks and robust environmental policies, according to a report released this week.
West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi ranked lowest on the 50-state scorecard produced by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that advocates for health care improvements.
Researchers at Northeastern and Yale universities ranked states based on risks from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, natural hazard risks to health care facilities and greenhouse gas emissions by the health care sector. The authors of the report also analyzed states’ clean energy policies and climate change mitigation efforts.
Climate change poses a severe threat to public health, leading health organizations have warned. Poor air quality, for example, contributes to between 100,000 and 200,000 excess U.S. deaths per year. Communities of color, low-income people, outdoor workers, people  with disabilities and homeless people are  more vulnerable to health harms associated with climate change.

In Florida, for example, nearly 15% of hospital beds are in high-hazard flood zones, according to the report — the highest share of any state. Coastal states Louisiana and Mississippi, where around 10% of hospital beds are in flood zones, also fared poorly.
West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota had the highest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from the health care sector in 2020. That year, West Virginia’s health care sector emitted 2,570 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent —- a measure of greenhouse gases’ warming effects —- per capita.
The report comes two days after President Donald Trump rebuffed the scientific consensus on climate change in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. “This ‘climate change’ – it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said in his Tuesday speech. The assembly included leaders from highly vulnerable nations and islands around the world that are suffering drought, threats to water security and increased flooding that scientists tie to climate change.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

The Trump administration has fired numerous officials and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and has rescinded environmental justice grants awarded to states, nonprofits and universities. The administration also shut down the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
In July, the EPA announced a proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards. These are based on scientific findings over decades that tie greenhouse gas emissions to public health dangers and serve as the basis for regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called the proposal “negligence” that will “cause great harm to the American people.”
Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona faced the greatest extreme heat-driven health risks, according to the scorecard. These states have significant Indigenous and Latino populations. Previous reports have shown American Indian and Alaska Natives have seen the greatest per-year average increase of heat-related deaths, and outdoor workers are disproportionately Black and Latino.
Arizona and California had the poorest air quality, most likely driven by ground-level ozone, wildfire smoke and dust, the researchers said. They used the federal air quality index, which estimates levels of five main air pollutants, to score the states on air quality.
Alaska and Hawaii ranked highest in air quality. Alaska’s low population density contributed to its score, while Hawaii, situated in the Pacific Ocean, benefits from winds that disperse air pollutants, the authors wrote.

(Logos)The union representing workers at Rhode Island’s ABC affiliate is urging a boycott of the station and its NBC counterpart to pressure new operator Sinclair Inc. to keep the two channels separate after it recently acquired ABC6’s non-license operations.
Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which already owns NBC 10 (WJAR), took over the infrastructure and operations for ABC6 (WLNE) on Sept. 12, putting the Maryland-based media company known for its conservative political content in control of two of the three TV stations covering Rhode Island and parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. CBS affiliate WPRI-12 is owned by Nexstar Media Group.
WLNE’s acquisition by Sinclair came as 20 unionized station employees organized under the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians of the Communications Workers of America in March 2024 were negotiating their first contract with Standard Media Group.
The union is calling on Sinclair to invest more in the station, rather than make cuts as it has done in other markets. 
“Viewers deserve journalism that is supported and invested in, not stripped for parts,” the union said in a press release. 
The union also demands Sinclair offer those it has laid off the ability to return, such as fan-favorite meteorologist Kelly Bates. Bates, who previously worked for NBC10, said ABC6 staff were alerted about the local market share agreement between Sinclair and Standard Meida during a staff meeting Sept. 11.
“I asked if everyone was going to walk out of here with a job and they said no,” she said in an interview Friday with Rhode Island Current. “Then they ended the meeting and told me I needed to come upstairs.”
Bates said she was told her position was redundant, which she said was puzzling as the initial statement from Sinclair “committed to producing distinctive content.”
“If you’re maintaining two distinct voices as they claim, then how am I redundant?” she said.
Jessica Bellucci, a spokesperson for Sinclair, did not respond to request for comment Friday.
Bates also worries what market consolidation will mean for the quality of news Rhode Island TV viewers receive.
“When you drop a source of information, it makes you less informed,” she said. “When these large corporations are buying these small stations, they lose their sense of community.”
Also off the job at ABC6 following the acquisition is sports reporter Nick Coit, who announced his departure from the station on Facebook Sept. 12. Daytime meteorologist Tyler Hughes, who joined the station in June, confirmed to Rhode Island Current Friday he is no longer at the station.
The Boston Globe has reported that WJAR eliminated nine jobs from its master control department, the final point before a station’s signal is transmitted over the air. 
To show support for workers across both stations, the union is asking viewers to call NBC 10 General Manager Vic Vetters and support workers and local programming. Public figures are being asked to decline interview requests from Channel 10 or Channel 6, and for advertisers to shun the stations. 
Vetters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sinclair owns and operates 182 television stations nationwide, including 25 NBC and 39 ABC affiliates. It entered the Providence-New Bedford market in 2014 when it bought WJAR after the station’s former owners, Media General, merged with another company.

Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota ReformerMike Lindell, the right-wing influencer and pillow salesman who has spent years spinning a debunked tale about the results of the 2020 election, is strongly considering a run for governor, the Star Tribune reported Friday.
Lindell has been accused of domestic violence; admitted to filing a “fake bankruptcy”; has made and lost fortunes; claimed to have spent 14 days awake on cocaine before his drug dealers staged an intervention; and once made a $5 million challenge to anyone who could disprove his claim that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump, only to have a computer programmer meet the challenge, leading to years of litigation.
Lindell’s current financial status is mostly opaque because his companies are private. He’s acknowledged financial struggles, both personal and corporate. He’s blamed the money issues on being “canceled” by mainstream media and retailers for his close ties to Trump.
The Strib reports that “Lindell is on the hook for $2.3 million, pending appeal, following a defamation verdict related to his election-fraud claims. He said in testimony during that case he is $10 million in debt.”
If the second Trump presidency has brought him financial relief and he can put up money for the campaign, he could become a top-tier contender for the Republican nomination for governor given his name recognition and daily production of media content selling himself and his products.

During the Idaho Legislature’s Legislative Council meeting Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, legislative leaders said they will convene the 2026 legislative session Jan. 12 and hope to adjourn for the year March 27, though there is no official deadline to end the session.
If they hit the nonbinding adjournment target, the legislative session would run 74 for days, which would be the shortest session since 2014.
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said he expects the session to be short because of budget cuts and the 2026 election, where all 105 seats in the Idaho Legislature will be up for election. 
“Generally, when we have years like this where the budgets are tight we’ll get things done faster because we don’t fight amongst ourselves as much,” Moyle said. “There’s nothing to fight over. So hopefully we can move that date up. This is an election year, and I assume that everybody around this table is going to be a target of somebody.”
High-stakes party primary elections take place in May, and legislators generally look to wrap up legislative sessions early in election years so they can return to their districts and campaign.

 Revenues are lagging behind projections in the state budget

State budget and revenues are also likely to be a major issue during Idaho’s 2026 legislative session. 
Through the first two months of the current fiscal year 2026, state revenues have come in $22.6 million, or 2.8%, below the state’s revised forecast.
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Idaho Legislature cut state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money state officials have to spend in the state budget, and the Idaho Constitution prohibits expenses exceeding revenues. 
Taxes are the largest source of state revenue in Idaho. 
Idaho state revenues continue to lag behind budget projections

To prevent a budget deficit, Gov. Brad Little announced that all state agencies – other than public schools – must cut 3% from their budgets in the current fiscal year. Little then made the 3% budget cuts permanent moving forward. 
Aside from the revenue shortfall and budget holdbacks, there are still other unresolved budget questions. 
There are about $109 million in general fund supplemental funding requests for the state of Idaho’s current fiscal year 2026 budget, said Keith Bybee, division manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office’s budget and policy division. 
The Idaho Legislature gets the final say on supplemental budget requests, which will be discussed during next year’s session.
Additionally, Idaho’s latest revenue and budget projections do not take into account the cost of conforming to the tax changes made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. 
“This is going to be an interesting year, because we’re going to be in a year where we’re going to be reducing budgets, and probably will be reducing taxes too because of some of the federal implications with the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Moyle said.
The nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated it could cost Idaho $167 million to conform to tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those tax changes include no tax on workers’ tips and no tax on workers’ overtime.
Because of the cost of revenue shortfalls, the supplemental funding requests and the cost of implementing the federal tax changes, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said the state could be facing a potential budget deficit of $200 million or more.
“This is not a disaster on the horizon; this is a disaster right now,” Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-26 20:52:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"With Marissa Gillett gone, what will PURA do next?",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/26/pura-gillett-eversource-ui/,"The sudden departure of Marissa Gillett, CT's top utilities regulator, has cast a pall of uncertainty over PURA and its pending docket.","The sudden departure of Connecticut’s top utilities regulator last week has cast a pall of uncertainty over the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and its pending docket of cases involving some of the state’s largest suppliers of electric, gas and water services.
PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillett announced her resignation last Friday after facing several legal challenges to her leadership from utility companies along with calls for her removal from Republican state lawmakers. Her departure leaves the authority with just two sitting members — Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron — less than half of its statutory size of five.
Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to name Gillett’s successor as chair of PURA, and his promise to lawmakers to fill the remaining vacancies at the authority by the end of this year now faces even more urgency.
“I need some folks with really strong analytical capabilities,” Lamont said earlier this week, adding that recent headlines and turmoil swirling around the agency had complicated his recruiting effort. “People are worried about lawsuits and impeachment, so there’s some hesitancy. But we’re going to get it done as soon as we can.”
“It’s not for lack of will, it’s just trying to get the right person there,” he added.
The shakeup also opened new questions about whether PURA, with just two members, can vote and issue final decisions on rate cases or other pending matters. Currently, the authority is scheduled to issue final decisions later this year in three major cases: requests to raise utility rates by United Illuminating and Yankee Gas, as well as a proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
While Gillett initially announced that her resignation will take effect on Oct. 10, she later agreed to recuse herself from those pending cases after facing pressure from utility officials to do so.
A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to requests for comment this week.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor’s office, called the issue “a bit of a gray area.” Lamont’s staff have sought additional clarification on the law from the Attorney General’s office, he said, but are operating under the presumption that three members are needed for a quorum and that the governor will have to appoint at least one new member by Oct. 10. 
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong’s office said Thursday it has yet to weigh in on the matter. 
Representatives of both of the major utility companies with cases before PURA, meanwhile, urged the authority’s remaining members to resolve those matters through negotiated settlements that could make the questions around the quorum issue moot.
“The conduct of agency leaders, including the chair, remain significant issues in Connecticut state courts,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in statement. “The circumstances of the past few days are unique and are unfolding as critical decisions affecting gas, water, and electric customers are being adjudicated before the agency. It is important that this work continues. We are ready to collaborate and discuss resolutions to these matters, including negotiated resolutions, in order to avoid additional litigation and to move the state forward.” 
In addition to its electric utility, Eversource owns both the Yankee Gas Company and Aquarion Water Company. 
Cheryl Kimball, an attorney representing United Illuminating, made a similar plea during oral arguments in the company’s pending rate case on Thursday. The arguments were heard by the two remaining commissioners, Arconti and Caron.
“This is a significant factor counseling toward a consensus resolution,” Kimball said. “If there is a consensus resolution, there is no appeal and the questions on quorum are avoided.”
UI’s request for a $105 million rate increase is currently at the front of PURA’s pending docket. Before Gillett’s resignation, the authority released a draft final decision on UI’s request that would instead increase the company’s revenues by $28.6 million.
In response, UI’s Chief Executive Frank Reynolds publicly warned that PURA’s proposal could force the company to cut its investments in the local electric grid, resulting in worse reliability and longer outages during storms. In a filing with PURA, the company also said it would have to lay off 71 employees due to the loss of revenues.
During arguments on Thursday, Kimball went even further to attack the authority’s proposal, which she said was “fully compromised” by Gillett’s leadership. “Signing off on any part of this decision will simply buy PURA more new litigation,” Kimball said.
In order to avoid such an outcome, Kimball said the company was willing to negotiate a one-month extension to PURA’s Nov. 1 deadline to issue a final decision on the rate case to allow for more time to reach a settlement. A UI spokeswoman said Friday the company planned to file a motion for such an extension as soon as next week that would allow the utility to collect any new rates retroactively.
If no extension is agreed to or PURA does not issue a final decision in the rate case, then UI’s original request for a $105 million increase would take effect on Nov. 1, according to the spokeswoman, Sarah Wall Fliotsos.
Such an increase would raise utility bills for UI customers by almost 10%, according to estimates from the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which represents utility customers before PURA. 
The head of that office, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman, said on Thursday that she was open to having discussions with UI and other interested parties — which include the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and cable companies that utilize UI’s utility poles — about a possible extension. Absent such an agreement, however, she said the remaining two commissioners still have the power to render their own decision. 
“In the face of all then noise around this decision, we’re hoping that the authority is able to focus on the legal standards and the evidence,” Coleman said. 
In additional to the UI rate case, PURA is also considering Yankee Gas’ request to increase revenues by $192 million, or more than 26%. That is the largest such request by any gas company in the state over the last two decades, according to PURA.
In a draft decision released days after Gillett announced her plans to step down, the authority instead proposed a more modest increase of $41.5 million, or about 5.7%.
Ratliff, the Eversource spokeswoman, said in statement that the company is continuing to evaluate the proposed decision. 
“It’s our obligation and responsibility to make sure that the system remains safe and reliable, and in order for that quality of service to continue, we must be able to make the necessary investments,” she said. “Certain aspects of this rate decision hinder our ability to continue to provide the same level of service.”
PURA has yet to issue a draft decision on the third major pending utility case involving the proposed sale of the Aquarion Water Company. Critics of the sale, including Tong and the Office of Consumer Counsel, argue that the sale could result in higher water rates for the utility’s 685,000 customers in Connecticut.
Those cases included thousands of pages of briefs, public comments and financial documents submitted by the utilities and other interested groups.
Gillett’s departure has also renewed criticism of Lamont’s decision to avoid making additional appointments to PURA during her tenure.
Lamont appointed Gillett in 2019 and since then has made one additional appointment, Arconti, to fill the seat left by the retirement of former Democratic Commissioner Jack Betkoski. Caron, the board’s only Republican, is serving out a term that formally expired in 2022.
“We’ve reached a point where that authority can no longer operate, and electric rates are no lower, and in fact they are higher than they’ve ever been,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. “And I think a lot of this is by the governor’s own doing.”
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, who co-chairs the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, said he was unsure whether the law would allow PURA to operate with just two appointed commissioners.
But Steinberg was also an ardent support of Gillett’s leadership, and he said that her loss had “effectively hobbled” the authority. 
“I don’t like the look of it,” Steinberg said. “With decisions that are as important as the ones before them, I don’t think with only two commissioners we are looking at the kind of accountability that Connecticut residents are counting on.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GILLETT-HEARING-0220-01-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Next week, Judge Daniel Green will decide if it is a ball or a strike.
Last Friday, Green ordered Hoskins to rewrite the ballot language approved by lawmakers after finding it was “insufficient and unfair” because it failed to mention the amendment would repeal abortion rights. 
In his ruling, Green wrote that the original ballot title “fails to adequately alert voters that it would eliminate” the constitutional right to reproductive health care that Missourians approved last fall.
Under a law passed this year and upheld this week by Green, Hoskins had seven days to submit his revisions. Now, the two sides in the case have three days to submit analysis.
If Green rules Hoskins failed, he will have five days to try again.
The new ballot language written by Hoskins states in full: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and
miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Amend Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allowing abortions for
medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; and
Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

The reproductive rights amendment that Missourians narrowly approved last fall legalized all abortions up until the point of fetal viability. Access to the procedure remains limited as Planned Parenthood affiliates have sued the state over a series of abortion regulations that remain on the books. 
“My main focus has been protecting Missouri’s families and the Constitution,” Hoskins said in a statement Friday. “This ballot title and language reflects my commitment to upholding the values Missourians hold dear. My office remains dedicated to ensuring voters are presented with clear and accurate information as they consider this important measure.”
The ACLU of Missouri, which is leading the case challenging the ballot language, did not respond to a request for comment.
‘A fundamental right’: Judge strikes down law giving Missouri AG special appeal power

Green also told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.
Hoskins’ new summary states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors. 
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
After the Republican supermajority of legislators voted in May to put the amendment on next year’s ballot, the ACLU of Missouri sued, arguing that the ballot language was unfair and that the amendment illegally included unrelated subjects to be used as “ballot candy.”
Green in his ruling last week concluded that lawmakers did not err in combining bans on gender-affirming health care for minors with reproductive rights.

Scanlan, shown here on Oct. 29, 2024, said New Hampshire state law does not allow the voter registration list to be shared with a federal department. (File photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is suing New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, arguing he is illegally withholding the state’s voter file from federal officials. 
In a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, federal attorneys say Scanlan is violating the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by not turning the voter file over to the federal government. The department argues it needs the file to ensure that New Hampshire is carrying out necessary maintenance of the list to prevent voter fraud. 
The department is also suing California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania over the same request for the voter file. 
Scanlan has refused to hand over the state’s voter registration list. In a letter to the federal Department of Justice in June, Scanlan said New Hampshire state law does not allow the list to be shared with a federal department.
“New Hampshire law authorizes the Secretary of State to release the statewide voter registration list in limited circumstances not applicable here,” Scanlan wrote in the June letter.
He referred to RSA 654:31, the state law that allows the list to be given out to political parties, political committees, or candidates for elected office, upon request.
“That said,” Scanlan continued, “each municipality’s public checklist can be obtained from their respective supervisors or clerks.”
After federal officials again asked for the list, Scanlan sent a second letter on Aug. 28 that reiterated the arguments of the first.
In the lawsuit, Trump administration lawyers note that HAVA requires each state to have provisions in its election system “to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are updated regularly.” The Department of Justice is empowered to enforce that, which can include requesting the voter file, they argue. 
They also point to an unusually low percentage of duplicate registrations in New Hampshire, according to the “Election Administration and Voting Survey 2024 Comprehensive Report.” New Hampshire identified 0.1% of registrations as duplicates, and the national average was 12.7%, the lawsuit notes. 
The lawsuit asks the federal court to “declare that any state law that prohibits Secretary Scanlan from providing the requested statewide voter registration list is preempted by federal law,” and to order Scanlan to comply.
“The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is tasked with ensuring that states conduct voter registration list maintenance to prevent the inclusion of ineligible voters on any state’s voter registration list for federal elections,” the lawsuit states. “This action seeks to remedy the State of New Hampshire’s violations of federal voting laws.”
Neither Scanlan nor the New Hampshire Department of Justice commented on the lawsuit Friday. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State’s Office, Anna Sventek, confirmed that the office had received the lawsuit but said Scanlan would not comment further. 
Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, had a similar message. “We have received the complaint and are reviewing it,” he said Friday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5328-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Weston County voters want more exclusive representation in the Legislature, but several court cases have said otherwise. 
The post Lawmakers hear pitch on redrawing Wyoming’s legislative districts to give rural counties more say in the statehouse appeared first on WyoFile .","NEWCASTLE—Last year, Weston County attempted to send additional lawmakers to the Wyoming Legislature under the theory that one of the state’s least populated counties was underrepresented in the statehouse.
That effort didn’t succeed directly, but it did spur more discussions on the issue of rural representation, culminating Thursday in a group of Weston County voters making their pitch to lawmakers for redrawing the state’s legislative maps to adhere to county lines. 
County residents offered a variety of solutions, from weighted votes to dramatically expanding the number of lawmakers. But their message was similar: the state’s most rural communities need a bigger voice.
“It makes all the difference in the world to have someone from your county that knows your school boards, knows your sanitation issues, knows your local hospital district issues,” local resident William Curley told the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Reapportionment Committee. 
Since Wyoming’s legislative districts were redrawn in 2022 following the last census, Curley, an attorney, has led the charge for Weston County, with a population of fewer than 7,000 residents, to have its own senator and representative. Right now, Weston County’s four legislators also represent varying portions of Campbell, Crook, Goshen and Niobrara counties. 
“It’s got to be a hard job for a senator to represent more than one community of interest in Wyoming at the same time, equally on all things,” Curley told the committee. 
Curley and other supporters point to the Wyoming Constitution, which states, “each county shall constitute a senatorial and representative district” and each “county shall have at least one senator and one representative.” 
A legal challenge, however, upended that requirement in 1991 when a federal court ruled that Wyoming’s legislative maps violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution — also known as “one person, one vote.”
Since then, the Legislature has shifted away from strict adherence to county boundaries and toward population. While the approach has held up — including against a 2012 legal challenge — supporters of county-aligned legislative districts contend it’s costing rural voters their say.
They presented several proposals to the committee Thursday to shift back to county maps, including weighted voting in the Legislature as well as both reducing and expanding the number of lawmakers. 
While several proposals attempted to take the Equal Protection Clause into account, some residents actively pushed back on the legal rule that one person’s voting power ought to be roughly equivalent to another person’s within the same state. 
“Why should somebody that lives in an apartment in Cheyenne be able to run just as much as this state as a rancher out here that’s got 5,000 acres that’s paying probably 10 times the property tax that that person in there is?” Danny Bau asked the committee. “Where’s his representation?”
How we got here 
Weston County commissioners passed a resolution in April 2024 declaring two legislative vacancies in an attempt to redress their concerns regarding the absence of lawmakers representing their county alone. 
At the time, supporters of that movement said they expected other rural counties to follow their lead, including those that also lack exclusive representation in the statehouse. That includes Big Horn, Carbon, Crook, Hot Springs, Johnson, Niobrara, Sublette and Washakie counties. None ultimately did so. 
Following the resolution, the Weston County commissioners voted in October to select Curley and Karl Lacey to fill the seats they’d declared vacant, according to Newcastle’s News Letter Journal. 
The Wyoming Republican Party backed the process, but without a corresponding legal challenge, it failed to go any further. Meantime, the Wyoming Legislature passed Senate File 174, “Constitutional apportionment of legislators.” 
The new law created the subcommittee and requires lawmakers to study the topic of county-aligned legislative districts. It calls on the committee “to conduct meetings around Wyoming to take input on apportionment options from members of the public and other interested stakeholders.”

Newcastle meeting
Thursday marked the committee’s first meeting.
“I would like to thank you for providing this nice, calm venue to discuss this and not being right after a census and taking the time to do research and talk to us,” Tricia Baumann, another local resident, told the committee. “It’s really appreciated.”  
Baumann presented lawmakers with what she called a “population-adjusted legislative apportionment” that would rely on lawmakers using a weighted voting system in Cheyenne. 
Under the proposal, the state’s least populated county, Niobrara County, would have one representative in the House with a quarter vote on the floor. 
“Our point is the Niobrara citizens now have a person from their county sitting in Cheyenne speaking for the commissioners, speaking for the courthouse of Niobrara, speaking for the citizens of Niobrara, but understandably can’t put a lot of weight into the floor vote because their population is so small,” Baumann said. 
In all other aspects of the Legislature — including in committee meetings where bills must get approval to move forward — all lawmakers would have equal footing despite the size of the population they represent.  
More populated counties would elect more than one lawmaker in at-large races, meaning voters in places like Laramie and Natrona County would elect several lawmakers to represent the same area. 
That raised a concern for Torrington Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz. More specifically, Steinmetz worried what it would mean for voters living in the rural areas just outside the more populated areas. Such voters tend to vote more conservatively than voters in the nearby cities. 
“If they’re all at-large in Natrona County, what is to prevent Casper, the urban center, from electing all of the senators or representatives? Is there something in the proposal to address that?”
The proposal does not address that possibility, said Curley, who drafted the plan with Baumann. 
Curley pointed to another potential shortcoming of the proposal. 
“If you follow county lines, maybe it’ll be an issue with tribes under federal law,” Curley said. 
Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, represents the Wind River Indian Reservation. The district in Fremont County includes Lander, Ethete, Fort Washakie and parts of Riverton. 
“It captures all the places on the reservation and elsewhere where Native American people live,” Case said. “And so that was done very, very deliberately. Now, if all of a sudden that representation were based on the county line … there’s a potential for that Native American strength in their voting to be diluted.”
Case also pushed back more generally on the weighted-vote proposal. 
“Let’s go back to that example of Niobrara County,” Case said. If the county ends up with a representative with a fraction of a vote, “Are they really better off that way?”
Local resident Sue Mareles presented a second proposal to lawmakers called “The Founders’ Plan” that used a “formula” to determine the number of representatives and senators per county. 
“It is a nice hybrid plan that you don’t have a huge legislature and you also don’t have weighted voting,” Mareles said. “You have an individual — a whole person with a whole vote.”
Using Mareles’ formula, Niobrara County would have one representative, while the state’s most populous county, Laramie County, would have 11 representatives. 
The formula’s findings differed quite greatly from the legal memo and math completed by the Legislative Service Office ahead of the meeting. 
“If the smallest county—Niobrara with 2,467 residents at the 2020 census—was apportioned one senator, and each Senate district represented no more than 10 percent over 2,467 residents, the Wyoming Senate would need at least 213 members to meet the proportional requirements. The Wyoming House would then need at least 426 members,” the memo states. Currently, the Wyoming Senate has 31 lawmakers. The House has 62.
Mareles’ formula didn’t square for Case. 
“How is that fair in any sense of the way and how would that conform with the United States Constitution about having equal representation?” he said. 
Mareles pointed to a sentence on the last page of the proposal — “larger deviations require justification by legitimate state interests (e.g., preserving political subdivisions, avoiding gerrymandering).”
What now?
While the committee heard out voters, no lawmaker committed to any one proposal.
“I just want to thank all of you guys for how much hard work you’ve put into this and giving us so much to think about,” Steinmetz said. “And we may not come up with an exact solution tonight, but getting this discussion in depth is really good. And maybe it’s making you rethink some ideas, too.”
Steinmetz floated the idea of amending the Wyoming Constitution while Douglas Republican Sen. Brian Boner pointed to New Hampshire as a possible model for Wyoming to consider. Its chamber consists of 400 members. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, who attended the meeting, asked lawmakers to take the issue seriously. 
“Those are the real concerns that the people that I talk to every day are worried about, is the fact that our voice is diminishing quickly,” Neiman said. 
“So we’ve got to be wise about how we do this and how we respect those lines,” Neiman said. “Does the state of Wyoming have the guts to say we’re going to challenge the federal government on this because it’s hurting us the way we’re doing this? The way you want us to do this, ladies and gentlemen, is harming our state’s ability to be able to even function.”
The committee will hold another meeting sometime before its Dec. 1 deadline to provide a report to the Legislature. It had not been scheduled by publishing time.

Richard Blumenthal, who reintroduced the Kids Online Safety Act, called on Meta to release its research about youth safety risks on the site.","A U.S. Senate hearing earlier this month — featuring whistleblower testimony from former researchers at Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta — offered an opportunity for Sen. Richard Blumenthal to reactivate his campaign for the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill that would require social platforms to do more to mitigate harms attributed to the ways children use their technology. 
Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford Friday, where he called for Meta to release its internal research about risks to youth safety and its parental safety tools. The remarks came two weeks after former Meta safety researchers testified to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law that the company covered up internal research that would have raised concerns about harmful effects on children of Meta’s virtual reality products.
“We are in the midst of a mental health crisis among young people that is aggravated and exacerbated relentlessly by social media,” he said, speaking outside The Village for Families & Children, which provides behavioral health services for children. 
Blumenthal has said his online safety bill, known as KOSA, would hold companies like Meta accountable and make more safety settings available on social platforms. “The research and the facts so far from these whistleblowers provide powerful documentation to the need for stronger measures for kids’ online safety,” he said.
While Congress is in the midst of a standoff over funding, Blumenthal said he’s hopeful for KOSA’s prospects once the funding issues are worked out.
But it’s already been a long road for the proposed bill. 
Blumenthal was first drawn to this issue in 2021 by another whistleblower — former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, who leaked documents showing Instagram’s effect on the mental health of teenage girls in 2021.
He first drafted the legislation, with Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, in 2022.
Last year’s version of the bill, which Blumenthal and Blackburn cosponsored, passed the Senate handily in a 91-3 vote. A reworked version passed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, but Congress adjourned before the full House could vote, requiring the process to start over again. 
Blumenthal and Blackburn reintroduced the bill this May. 
The bill would allow addictive features and algorithmic recommendations to be disabled by users. It would establish what’s referred to as a “duty of care” requirement for tech companies to prevent harms to minors on their sites, and require annual independent audits of these risks. It would also create an 11-member bipartisan council of academics, researchers, parents, and young people to provide recommendations.
Opponents have argued the bill could lead to censorship and free speech violations. Some groups focusing on privacy and LGBTQ+ rights voiced concerns that kids would be cut off from support resources only accessible to them via social media.
The bill has been revised several times and has picked up support along the way from a range of tech industry leaders including Apple and Elon Musk.
Some initial critics turned around to support a rewritten version of the bill that tweaked who could enforce its “duty of care” provision.
NetChoice — a trade association that represents Meta and dozens of other technology companies — has called KOSA unconstitutional, stating in handout materials that the bill is “compelling companies to restrict protected speech” and arguing that “parents will be replaced by a council of big government bureaucrats.” The group did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Others remain unconvinced, such as Fight for the Future, a digital rights group led by queer and transgender women. The group hired a billboard truck in June to criticize how KOSA could limit access to resources about reproductive health and gender-affirming care for kids.
Blumenthal said he expects the Senate to vote on the bill before the end of this year.
But pushing House leaders to hold a vote remains a challenge. Blumenthal said that he and Blackburn have meetings with House members planned in D.C. this week to discuss the bill. He said Blackburn is leading those meetings because her party holds the House.
He said he also hopes “allies in the White House” will press House leadership to hold a vote.
Speaking alongside Blumenthal on Friday, Laine Taylor, chief medical officer, said she supports the bill because she sees the negative effects of social media use in children she works with.
“There are lots of discussions around limitations being put on social media,” Taylor said. “So much of it is put on parents, and there’s only so much you can know.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9598-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges that on Sept. 4 and Sept. 6 of last year, registered nurse Brycen  Allen Meyer of Fairfax arrived for work at University of Iowa Health Care’s Urology Clinic while impaired by alcohol and/or “substances not prescribed” to him. The board also alleges Meyer engaged in “unwelcomed physical contact with another staff member” when he grabbed a co-worker’s wrist.

The board has charged Meyer with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
To resolve the case, Meyer recently agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists individuals with substance abuse or alcohol issues.
Other Iowa nurses recently sanctioned by the board include:
— Licensed practical nurse Ecco Schwartz of Shell Rock, who was issued a warning and ordered to complete 30 hours of educational training on nursing documentation after being charged with failure to assess or evaluate the status of a patient. The board alleged that while working at an unspecified rehabilitation center, Schwartz improperly documented that she had administered medication to a patient that was actually administered by another nurse, that she “left treatments in two residents’ rooms,” and that she left a medication cart unlocked and unattended.
— Licensed practical nurse Kayla Waskow of Decorah, who was charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient, and engaging in behavior that was contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that in April 2024, Waskow’s employer, whom the board has not publicly identified, conducted a random audit of staff access to the electronic health records. As a result of the audit, the employer allegedly found that Waskow had accessed multiple patients’ records for no job-related purpose. Waskow allegedly admitted she had done so in an effort to track the patient census at her place of employment. The board issued Waskow a warning.
— Registered nurse Shawn Dale Friedrich of Peosta, who was recently charged with misappropriating medications or property belonging to a patient or clinic. The board alleges that in January 2025, Friedrich was found to have a variety of medications in his backpack, including lidocaine, bupivacaine, and other substances — some of which, the board alleges, had not been prescribed to him. According to the board, Friedrich stated he had taken the medications from kits in the emergency department that would have otherwise been discarded, and that any medications he ingested were limited to those prescribed to him. To resolve the case, Friedrich agreed to a settlement that calls for him to accept a warning from the licensing board and to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program.
— Registered nurse Regan Lind Cairney of West Des Moines, who was recently charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum. The board alleged that on Jan. 2, 2024, three individuals were transported to and cared for in the emergency department and intensive care unit at the Des Moines hospital where Cairney worked. The hospital later ran an audit to find out who accessed medical records for the patients after their arrival and found that Cairney had accessed records for two of them for no legitimate purpose. According to the board, she was fired from the hospital. To resolve the licensing board charges, Cairney agreed to a settlement that calls for her to accept a warning and complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.

Kay Ivey announced Friday afternoon that she will not call a special session to redraw Alabama’s State Senate map following a federal court ruling that the current map violates the Voting Rights Act.
“As the law currently stands, states like Alabama are put to the virtually impossible task of protecting some voters based on race without discriminating against any other voters based on race,” Ivey said in a statement released Friday. “I remain hopeful that we will somehow find the ‘magic map’ that will both satisfy the federal court and also be fair to all Alabamians. But as of today, I cannot justify the time and expense of calling a special session.”
The move could set up another confrontation over redistricting with the federal courts, two years after judges ordered the drawing of new congressional maps after finding the Legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act and later failed to come up with an adequate map to allow Black Alabamians to meaningfully participate in the political process. 
The ruling came out of a lawsuit challenging the state’s redistricting decisions in 2021. Messages seeking comment were left with the plaintiffs’ attorneys Friday afternoon.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, ruled last month that the state could draw another majority-minority or near-majority minority Senate district in the Montgomery area. She outlined two possible scenarios earlier this week for her order to be upheld: a special session, or a court ordered map. 
Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the case, appealed Manasco’s ruling, citing the Supreme Court’s expected ruling in Callais v. Louisiana,  which challenges the constitutionality of majority-minority district.  Ivey also mentioned the case in her statement.
“In the meantime, I call on the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify the law in this area as soon as possible and relieve states like Alabama from this no-win situation,” the statement from Ivey said.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 upheld a lower court ruling — in which Manasco played a part — ordering Alabama to draw at least one additional congressional district that was majority-minority or close to it. The state Legislature that July approved a map that the panel called unresponsive. The state appealed but lost again at the U.S. Supreme Court, which led to a court-appointed special master drawing new congressional maps.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board will commit to reviewing cannabis advertisements within a five-day timeframe and give retailers more leeway to advertise on social media, among other changes, as part of the deal.

Vermont’s cannabis regulator will ease some of its restrictions on how retailers can market their products as part of a settlement announced this week with a cannabis dispensary in Middlebury and a statewide group that lobbies for the cannabis industry.
The deal resolves a lawsuit that FLŌRA Cannabis and the Vermont Cannabis Action Fund brought against the state’s Cannabis Control Board last December. The civil case, filed in Addison County Superior Court, argued that Vermont’s cannabis advertising rules infringed on retailers’ constitutionally protected rights to free expression.
A judge still needs to sign off on the settlement, which is expected to happen within the next several days, Dave Silberman, co-founder of FLŌRA Cannabis, said Friday.
The settlement “provides immediate, meaningful relief to an industry that has earned the right to be treated with respect rather than contempt, and avoids a lengthy and expensive trial,” Silberman said in a Thursday press release announcing the deal.
Existing Vermont law requires the Cannabis Control Board to approve advertisements that retailers have designed before those ads can run. That generally won’t change under the settlement, though the board now has a limited time window to do its review. If regulators don’t make a decision on whether an ad is permissible within five business days, the ads will automatically be granted approval.
The settlement also gives cannabis retailers more leeway to market on social media. They’ll now be allowed to advertise specific products on their feeds, provided the ads do not use images of those products. As part of the deal, retailers will also have to give the board a list of all of their feeds so that regulators can keep an eye on those posts.
Another measure in the settlement will reduce the frequency with which retailers have to get state approval for recurring ad campaigns, such as a weekly newsletter. Now, once the board signs off on a basic template for recurring ads, that approval will be valid for a year. That limits the possibility of a retailer needing to get each individual installment of an ad campaign approved by state regulators.
The control board has also agreed to develop a shorter version of a warning describing potential health risks from consuming cannabis that’s required to be part of retailers’ TV and radio ads. James Pepper, the board’s chair, said the current warning takes about 30 seconds to read, but the board is working on a new version, in conjunction with the state Department of Health, that could be read in five seconds or less.

Pepper said Friday that, overall, the control board is happy with the settlement and noted the changes would reduce some of the workload for his staff, too. 
“What we agreed to is actually, I think, a really common sense approach — a pathway forward that maintains the intent of what the (Vermont Legislature) wanted with respect to cannabis advertising, while reducing administrative burden, both internally and for the cannabis industry,” he said.
Pepper and Silberman said they expect to continue discussing changes to the state’s cannabis regulations with lawmakers when Vermont’s 2026 legislative session starts in January. All of the changes included in this week’s settlement impact how the control board enforces the state’s laws, not the underlying legal language itself.
Silberman said Friday that he and others in the retail cannabis industry are eager to eliminate the requirement that they submit their ads for regulators’ review entirely, a process they see as “blatantly unconstitutional.” He said he wants cannabis to be regulated like other similar industries, such as alcohol production.
“This is a top priority for the industry,” he said. “We do good for this state — and it’s time for the Legislature to recognize that, and stop treating us like we are a threat to society.”

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin) New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and the New Mexico State Bar say immigrant communities in New Mexico should be wary of a recent scam: Fraudsters who pretend to be immigration attorneys and contact people online. 
Torrez, in a news release Friday morning, said the office is seeing “rising numbers” of online scammers posing as legitimate lawyers. The scammers directly message people online via social media and may use the names and license numbers of real attorneys. 
“These scammers go to great lengths to deceive people, targeting immigrant communities seeking legal help,” Torrez said in a statement. “They use sophisticated schemes to gain trust and steal money.”

The fake lawyers are not only scamming people out of money, according to Torrez’s office. They have also reportedly given bad legal advice, causing some of their clients to miss appointments or hearings, according to the news release. 
Torrez’s office offered tips to consumers about detecting these scams. For one: Contacting individuals directly to offer legal services in exchange for money violates the state’s Rules of Professional Conduct. So any supposed lawyer reaching out directly to someone via social media “is likely a scam,” according to the news release. 
Consumers should also be skeptical of purported immigration attorneys who:

ask for money via gift cars, Bitcoin or apps like Venmo;
make an offer that sounds too good to be true; or
rush consumers to sign contracts or threaten them with deportation

Because the scammers sometimes use the names or license numbers of actual lawyers, the AG also recommends consumers contact the State Bar for help assessing the attorney’s legitimacy, or contact the named attorney directly. 
The office also released fact sheets about the scam in English and Spanish.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 16:56:53.712329

(Screenshot from campaign ad)Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien is dropping his bid for governor after a turbulent week for his campaign, saying he doesn’t see a way for him to win the Republican nomination. 
Berrien, the owner and chief executive officer of Pindel Global Precision Inc. and Liberty Precision New Berlin and a former Navy SEAL, entered the race about three months ago, saying the state needed a businessman in charge and trying to compare himself with President Donald Trump as a way of appealing to people. 
His exit leaves two Republicans in the race: U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the highest-profile candidate, launched his campaign this week, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann launched in May. 
Berrien cited two reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week as his reason for leaving the race, saying they were “clearly targeted to force me out of the race.” 
“As a result of our politics today, I cannot focus on the issues I know will turn Wisconsin around. I have come to the conclusion I do not have a path to the nomination,” Berrien said in a statement.
The Journal Sentinel articles found that Berrien had scrubbed his activity on the online publishing platform Medium.com where he followed Jiz Lee, a queer, trans nonbinary adult film performer, along with other authors of sexually explicit essays. Berrien had entered the race boasting of his conservative values, including saying he’d “keep boys out of our daughters’ sports and locker rooms,” a reference to the issue of transgender girls participating on girls’ sports teams. 
The Berrien campaign attempted to downplay the news this week, but it quickly traveled across the internet, even garnering the attention of Jiz Lee, the Journal Sentinel reported in a follow-up article. They wrote in a post on Bluesky it is “okay to follow trans porn stars” and “to read articles about sex and relationships,” but that “what’s not okay is the hypocrisy of backing forceful legislation that restricts what people, trans and otherwise, can do with their own bodies.” 
“That is shameful,” they said. 
Berrien downplayed his online activity in his statement, saying he followed over 5,000 people across various platforms, subscribed to over 100 newsletters and has hit the ‘like’ button on 20,000 posts.  
“It was a major attack piece and we confirmed opposition research started in January of this year, if not earlier,” Berrien said. “And for what? For reading! Nothing illegal, nothing unethical and nothing immoral. Just reading. Wouldn’t you want your political and business leaders (and all of society, frankly) to be widely read and thoughtful and aware of different perspectives and ideas? Yet, when a supposedly major metropolitan newspaper condemns someone for reading, we have ourselves a problem.” 
The primary for the open governor’s race, scheduled for August 2026, is still about a year out. 
Ahead of the news on his online activity this week, Berrien had already found pushback to his candidacy from Trump-aligned conservatives because he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, including donating over $30,000 to her campaign.
Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman highlighted Trump’s influence  in the Republican primary in a statement about Berrien’s exit, saying it is a “lesson” for GOP candidates. 
“If you don’t show complete and total loyalty to Trump — past or present — then you better pack your bags and head for the door,” Shulman said. “His failure, despite his resume, financial investment, and doing somersaults to earn Trump’s love, shows just how far the other GOP candidates are going to have to go to win the nomination.” 
While the Republican field is shrinking, the Democratic field for governor is still growing with at least eight candidates in the race. 
Announced Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former state Rep. Brett Hulsey and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.

Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves, and Democratic businessman Darden Copeland each made six-figure loans to their U.S. Congressional campaigns, financial disclosure reports filed on Sept. 25 show. 
The trio’’ self-funding accounts for just under half of the $2.5 million raised by the eight major candidates from both parties ahead of the October 7 primary. 
The primary winners will face off in a December 2 special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who stepped down from his seat in July after winning reelection in November. The 7th district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. 
In the GOP primary 12 candidates are running, but Bulso, Reeves — both of Williamson County — state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson and former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps are considered the frontrunners. 
Throughout the campaign, the four Republican candidates have made clear that they plan to back President Donald Trump’s agenda. The four have collectively raised around $1.7 million.
Candidates for the Democratic nomination in Tennessee’s Congressional District 7 special election participated in a Nashville forum on Sept. 9. From left, Rep. Vincent Dixie, Rep. Aftyn Behn, businessman Darden Copeland and Rep. Bo Mitchell.
The Democratic primary includes Copeland and Nashville state Reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell. The Democrats all want to serve as a check to the Trump administration and have been primarily debating who is best equipped to win the general election in a district rated as solidly Republican by the Cook Political Report, which provides independent, nonpartisan analysis of congressional elections.
Green won the past two elections for the 7th District by the same margin of roughly 20 percent. 
Collectively, the four Democratic candidates raised about $825,000.
As of Sept. 25, around 16,500 voters had cast a ballot in the primary election as part of early voting, which ends on Oct. 2. 
How the Republican candidates compare
The four GOP candidates can be broken down into two groups. Reeves, Barrett and Van Epps have each raised a significant portion of their campaign from individuals, while most of Bulso’s campaign is self-funded.
Van Epps has raised around $360,000, the most of any Republican candidate when personal funds are excluded. Reeves brought in around $270,000, Barrett $235,000 and Bulso $55,000.
Reeves and Bulso are neck and neck in terms of overall funds raised, with a total of over $550,000 each. Bulso has put almost $500,000 of his own money into the campaign, and Reeves loaned himself $300,000. 
How the Democrats compare
Copeland leads Democrats in total money raised at around $435,000. About $125,000 comes from personal loans, and the remaining $300,000 is from individual contributions. He has raised the most in non-self funds, but about a third of his money has come from out-of-state donors. 
Mitchell has raised around $200,000, putting in $10,000 of his own money. Behn raised around $150,000 and Dixie brought in $140,000.

The move will “bring financial stability” to the publication, which loses about $160,000 per year, the office said in the news release.
“Goldenseal is one of the state’s most prized publications, and we are excited to see it evolve into a publication that is free and accessible to all,” Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said in a news release. “For 51 years, the magazine has told stories of West Virginia’s people and heritage, and, as of this week, those stories — going back to its first edition published in the 1970s — are available online at no cost. This new platform also gives us the ability to add multimedia content and begin working with students around the state who are eager to contribute stories about our history and culture.”
She added that the new site will remove the paywall, giving readers free unlimited access to some of the state’s most prized traditions.  
“We look forward to sharing these treasured stories with a larger audience for years to come,” Ruby said. 
Ruby previously told West Virginia Watch the magazine, which was first published in 1975, had lost $640,000 in taxpayer money over the past five years because of declining subscriptions and rising postage and printing costs. 
The number of subscriptions has declined from its peak of more than 30,000 to fewer than 4,000 today, she said. 
Besides the new format, the magazine will also partner with universities and schools — beginning with West Virginia University at Parkersburg and Glenville State University — to increase content on the site. The student-written articles highlighting the youth of Appalachia will appear alongside pieces from the paid contributors who have worked with Goldenseal for years, the news release said.
Each year, a commemorative book will be published with print versions of the magazine’s content and sold at a price that will cover production costs, the news release said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced Thursday that Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. soldiers for their role in the Wounded Knee Massacre will not be rescinded.
The massacre occurred on Dec. 29, 1890. Lakota people were camped near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and chaotic shooting ensued.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
Hegseth used the word “battle” to describe the massacre.
“Under my direction, we’re making it clear, without hesitation, that the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 will keep their medals,” Hegseth said in a video posted to social media. “And we’re making it clear that they deserve those medals. This decision is now final, and their place in our nation’s history is no longer up for debate.”
Defense secretary orders review of Wounded Knee Massacre medals

Hegseth’s predecessor during the Biden administration, Lloyd Austin, created a panel last year to review the medals. At the time, the Defense Department said “approximately 20” soldiers had received a Medal of Honor for participating in the massacre. Historians have noted that the records associated with some of the medals are incomplete or unclear.
There was no public report from the panel and no public action on the matter by the Biden administration before Biden left office. Hegseth held up a report in his social media video that he said was generated by that panel in October, but the Defense Department has not published it. A request from South Dakota Searchlight for the report is pending with the department.
“Upon deliberation, that panel concluded that these brave soldiers should, in fact, rightfully keep their medals from actions in 1890,” Hegseth said.
Hegseth alleged the prior administration was too concerned with being “politically correct” to share a final decision. 
Oliver “OJ” Semans, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member who advocates for the revocation of the medals, said he wasn’t surprised by Hegseth’s statements. Semans said he felt the review panel’s makeup was skewed toward protecting the military’s image.
“I think it’s a shame that Secretary Hegseth was misled by his predecessor’s report,” Semans said.
Past efforts to rescind the medals through congressional action have failed. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, introduced another bill to do so this year.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, was at a public event Friday in Rapid City, about 90 miles from Wounded Knee. Thune said the decision was Hegseth’s to make and that the decision was supported by an “independent review.”
South Dakota Searchlight asked Thune if he agreed with Hegseth’s use of the word “battle” and Hegseth’s statement that the soldiers “deserve those medals.”
“Whenever you’re talking about those types of events in our nation’s history, you need to do it in a respectful way,” Thune said. “I didn’t watch what he said, but like I said, I think the decision that he issued is the one that everybody will end up having to adhere to.”

The report suggests it will be expensive to implement the Medicaid work requirements included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
Under that law, the 40 states plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act must require the expansion population – low-income adults under 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level – to either work or engage in other activities such as job training or higher education for at least 80 hours per month.
The law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $911 billion over the next decade, largely because the new work requirements will push people off the rolls. The new rules take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
Supporters say the work requirements will encourage people to get jobs that offer health care coverage. But critics argue that most Medicaid recipients already work, and that most people who lose coverage will be dropped because they fail to meet the reporting requirements.
In October 2020, Georgia received federal approval to test Medicaid work requirements for an initial 5-year period. Its program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, is available to people between the ages of 19 and 64, with incomes at or below the federal poverty level, who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaid. Georgia originally planned to begin enrollment in July 2021, but legal challenges delayed implementation until July 2023.
As of May 2025, Georgia reported that 7,463 people were enrolled, far fewer than the 25,000 the state had expected to enroll during the first year of the program.
Between 2021 and June 2025, Georgia spent $54.2 million on administrative costs, compared with $26.1 million on providing medical care, according to GAO. About $50.8 of the administrative spending went toward changing the state’s system for determining people’s eligibility and enrolling them. In addition, the state used $20 million it received under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to advertise the program.
Georgia officials told GAO that the pause in implementation forced them to do some things twice, raising administrative costs by between 20% and 30%. This included IT system changes, coordination with other agencies, and staff training.
“Every state Medicaid program is different, and so the amount or proportion of administrative costs that states may have to upgrade their systems and implement the new work requirements can vary by state,” Michelle Rosenberg, the GAO health care director, said in an interview.
“I suspect some states may require less administrative spending, and other states may require more. But I do think this is the best information we have available on what states’ experiences may be like.”
The Georgia Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia Pathways to Coverage, did not respond to multiple Stateline requests for comment.
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the lawmakers who requested the GAO report, said it proves that Medicaid work requirements are a waste of taxpayer dollars.
“This report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,” the Democrat said in a news release. “If Republican politicians were serious about getting people to work, they would have closed the coverage gap nationwide and cut out the government bureaucracy.”

More than $1 million dollars of the water development funds had been designated for religious-specific education and enrollment of students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker, a college based in Steubenville, Ohio. 
“Said distributions are unconstitutional as they violate the establishment clause of the West Virginia and U.S. Constitutions,” Kanawha County Circuit Richard Lindsay wrote in the order Thursday.
Lindsay granted a motion for summary judgment to the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and the American Humanist Association, who filed suit in January against the Water Development Authority to stop it from issuing the grant to Catholic school.
The state’s Water Development Authority had approved giving $5 million to the Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college in 2024 to expand into West Virginia and to create a conservative think tank without a required recommendation from one of three state officials. The grant was first reported by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and the News and Sentinel. 
In the lawsuit, the organizations argued that in granting the money to the Ohio-based school, the Water Development Authority abdicated its duties of providing financial assistance to West Virginia communities to protect water quality and public health and encourage economic growth. The move also violated the guarantee of freedom of religion codified in the state constitution, they said.
In July, Lindsay sided with the ACLU and American Humanist Association, saying the Water Development Authority had violated the state constitution by giving the public money to the Catholic school.
The judge gave the Water Development Authority 30 days to show evidence of its compliance with the constitution, the ACLU said.  
The Water Development Authority has complied with his order, Lindsay said in a new order, prompting him to grant plaintiffs’ request for summary judgment in the case.
According to the order, the Water Development Authority grant money in question will now be used for “real estate acquisition, site development, construction, infrastructure improvements, supplies and equipment for workforce training.” 
In his order, Lindsay wrote that, “… as long as a state-approved grant is used for non religious purposes and is a benefit available to the public, said grant is constitutional.” 
In a press release, American Humanist Association Executive Director Fish Stark said the group still questioned the decision to offer state subsidies to religious schools.
“We’re satisfied that the court found the original grant unconstitutional and maintained that  state funds cannot be spent on religious instruction or sectarian advocacy in the future, even if the funding restrictions could have cut deeper,” Stark said. “This was always an affront to West Virginian taxpayers, which is why we took action when our members saw this blatant violation of church state separation happening in their community.”

Students at the College of St. Joseph the Worker earn a Bachelor of Arts in Catholic Studies while also receiving training in several trades, including carpentry, HVAC and plumbing. According to Lindsay’s order, a letter from the college acknowledged that the grant money wouldn’t be spent on religious advocacy of any kind or teacher salaries.
“No question of constitutional law or infirmity remains,” Lindsay wrote in the order.
The state’s Water Development Authority was created in 1977 by the state Legislature to provide grants and loans to local governments and public services districts for construction of water and wastewater infrastructure. The board also uses the funds for economic development projects across the state. 
Following Lindsay’s order, ACLU-WV Advocacy Director Rusty Williams said in a news release, “Tens of thousands of West Virginians lack access to clean drinking water, and it is  unconscionable that their tax dollars were intended to go to an out-of-state entity for purposes  that would have violated our constitution.”
“We call on the state to prioritize the needs of West Virginians, not the wants of religious institutions, in future decision-making,” he said.

LANL completed the venting of containers, releasing very little tritium according to state environmental officials. (Courtesy of LANL)Los Alamos National Laboratory and federal officials completed the depressurization of four containers that were potentially building up pressure, and released only a small amount of the radioactive gas tritium into the air, state environment officials said on Friday.
In 2016, LANL officials discovered the drums were building pressure, could potentially explode and, in a worst-case scenario, release tritium at a rate double the airborne radiation limit for the whole year. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear research. The EPA characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin, and is only considered hazardous in large quantities from inhalation, skin absorption or consumed in tritiated water — a replacement of one of the hydrogen molecules with tritium.
Instead, officials found the containers were fully sealed and intact, according to reports from the National Nuclear Security Administration to the New Mexico Environment Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which monitored the release. Depressurization was delayed several times by rain, and started on Sept. 16 and ended on Sept. 23.
“From the data we collected, received and reviewed, we really just don’t have any belief that there was any concerns for public exposure to the tritium at levels above background in the area,” Hazardous Waste Bureau Chief, John-David Nance told Source NM.
The NNSA reported total emissions to be around 0.005 millirems — much lower than radiation exposure of 3.7 millirems from a cross-country flight.
Anti-nuclear and indigenous groups criticized LANL and federal officials for a lack of transparency around the  plan to depressurize the containers and said their safety concerns were ignored.
The state required LANL to have a stricter “hard stop limit” as a nod to the concerns for exposure limits for children and pregnant women.
New Mexico Environment Department approves LANL plan to vent radioactive gas

NMED posted daily updates on social media about the release,  as Nance said the state wasn’t “exactly satisfied with LANL’s communications,” in the days leading up to the releases.
The NNSA and laboratory are required by state officials to issue a report about the depressurization and hold a meeting within the 30 days as part of the requirements from the state.
Nance said additional samples collected off-site by the New Mexico Environment Department will be released to the public in three to five weeks, after being verified.
“Recorded emissions we have were very low, but we’re are working to verify that with a third-party,” Nance said.

A friend stepped in to help, letting the family use her garden tap, but the experience has raised concerns about how prepared the town is to support community members during a drought.

A family of five in Northfield has been without running water for 12 days.
When the spring water they rely on at their home trickled to a stop on Sept. 9 because of the state’s ongoing drought, Kelly Murch said she started to call around for options.
And with three children — ages 2, 7 and 11 — it’s been “a weird time,” she said. Like living in “Little House on the Prairie,” a TV series based on a book about a 19th-century homesteading family.
At first, their neighbor helped them out by lending a large tank and his truck. With permission from the town, they filled up four times at the spigot in the community garden and paid $5 per round. 
Murch and her husband ran a garden hose from the filled-up tank through a window to a big old water cistern in their basement, which is working well thanks to gravity, she said, even though it’s “not very elegant.” 
Then, on Wednesday, the town turned the water off in the garden, Murch said.
Town Manager Jeff Schulz said he regretted that the community garden spigot had to be shut down. The town needed to cut the access due to fears of tampering or unintended contamination, he said, something state regulators say is a real concern. 
“We need to protect the water system and should not allow for limited and unmonitored access to the system without a policy,” Schulz wrote in an email. “Thus far we have provided that resident with about 400 gallons of water and we do very much sympathize with the residents being without water.”
Luckily, Murch and her family were able to turn to a community member and friend for help. On Friday morning, they filled up the tank at a friend’s yard in town. 
“I was really concerned initially,” said the friend, Sarah Eath, “because we didn’t know where they were going to get water from. And I was worried they wouldn’t be able to stay in their house.” She is glad now it’s “more of a limited water than no water” situation.
Murch and her family have to be very mindful about their water use, Murch said. They are taking their wash to a laundromat, though it is time-consuming and expensive; saving gray water from dishes for reuse; and taking really short showers. All of it is particularly hard with a 2-year-old who is being potty trained, she added. While they were teaching her to flush before the water shortage, now they are telling her not to.

In Northfield for four years, Murch is grateful she has the support of friends and neighbors. But she is worried about others, particularly older residents, who may not be as lucky and are without water during what is being called a historic drought across Vermont and the Northeast. She’s also not happy the town hasn’t been more proactive about informing residents about the drought, water conservation and options for potable water. 
Murch, who worked as a disaster response instructor with the Red Cross in Washington state before she moved to Vermont, said she is shocked the town doesn’t have an emergency plan for drought in place and hasn’t better informed residents about the ongoing drought. 
“Water is just so essential, you know,” Murch said. “It boggles my mind the fact that there is not an organized effort to go door-to-door and check on residents, or out-of-town people who don’t have water and don’t know what to expect because they haven’t been notified that there’s anything going on.”
According to Northfield’s All-Hazards Mitigation Plan, updated in 2023, the town does have a municipal emergency response plan but flooding — not drought — is the major focus. The 2023 document does suggest the town “should consider what, if any, actions should be considered based off best practices related to drought, mitigation, state guidance, and risk.”

Montpelier and Barre are among communities that have issued water conservation alerts as a result of the drought conditions playing out across the state. As of Thursday, almost 70% of the state, including Washington County, remains in a severe drought, and 24% of the state is in extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
“So really being smart about reducing water use is a really big thing” for people in the drought affected areas, said Ben Montross, drinking water manager for Vermont. This applies to residents who are not having issues now because they could potentially be affected too, he said.
The state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Montross, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of these, 77% of the reports represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well and 20% represent drilled wells.
He urged residents on community water systems to pay attention to notifications and guidance posted online by municipalities. Those who don’t have running water could also let their state representatives know, he said.
The state’s drought database maps at least six water outages in Northfield affecting residents who have private wells, reported between Aug. 25 and Sept. 1. Four of them are fed by spring water, two are wells.
Schulz, the town manager, said he has only heard from one — Murch. He encouraged all residents to call the town if they are facing a water scarcity problem.
On the job for more than 11 years, Schulz said he has never faced a situation where residents in Northfield have run out of water. He posted a brief advisory Monday on the town’s Facebook page asking residents connected to the town water system to be “mindful and conservative” in their water use.
“Northfield is fortunate that its water source consists of three very high yielding ground water wells and the wells continue to produce at normal levels,” the post states.
The town will discuss a policy and procedure to sell municipal water to residents or businesses at the Oct. 6 utility commission meeting, Schulz said, and address measures to ensure the public water system, which is highly regulated by the state, is protected. They will also discuss an emergency plan.
For alternate options, Schulz pointed to “a well-known source of spring water on Route 12A that is accessible to anyone at no cost” and private water haulers, which cost money. 
That public source on Route 12A is hard to access with large containers, and it is also flowing low currently, according to Murch.
Fresh well water is also available from an outside spigot at the Capital City Grange, according to Merry Shernock, vice chair of the selectboard.
Meanwhile, residents facing water shortages have been stopping in to buy water jugs, 5 gallon buckets and larger water containers at a longtime hardware store in town.
“I happen to have a spring still going, but I’m hearing about (other) people having issues,”  said Ray Fernandez, owner of Fernandez Hardware.
“Some of the basic stuff you can solve your problem with at the hardware store. For the rest, you have to wait for Mother Nature or wait for the drill company,” Fernandez said.
That’s another hard-to-come-by option in Vermont, according to Murch. She said she called about a dozen different contractors that dig wells in Vermont and found they are booked out months, through next year. Many of them are in Massachusetts or New York.
When she was poking around to find the cause of the water stoppage, she came across the state’s drought resources page created by the Agency of Natural Resources. She found there was funding available for residents interested in drilling a well, but there was an application deadline.
“We missed it by six days,” she said. “But we didn’t even know there was a problem until there was a problem.”
State officials said the Healthy Homes program — which predates the drought — closed on Sept. 3. They pointed to the Department of Environmental Conservation’s On-Site Loan program that does not currently have a deadline, and some other options that could help Vermont residents with water supply repairs.

One of the cases involves Kristal Klaahsen, previously known as Kristal Lake, who worked as a substance abuse counselor at Manning Regional Healthcare Recovery from November 2014 through September 2020.
While working in Manning, Klaahsen was accused of engaging in several inappropriate actions, including pursuing a sexual relationship with a client, requesting a client to undress in front of her, and engaging in a relationship with a client’s husband.
A Board of Behavioral Health Professionals investigation allegedly revealed that Klaahsen had sent a client, identified in board records as B.C., several inappropriate and sexually explicit texts, photos and videos. The client alleged that toward the end of his inpatient treatment, Klaahsen began flirting with him and the two exchanged sexually oriented text messages and conversed on Snapchat. The client alleged that when he later learned that Klaahsen was in a relationship with someone else he became angry and relapsed.
On May 10, 2021, the board charged Klaahsen with making suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks or advances to a client. Klaahsen later agreed to voluntarily surrender her social work license and wait a minimum of one year prior to seeking reinstatement.
On Feb. 24, 2025, Klaahsen filed a reinstatement request with the board. On April 29, 2025, the board notified her it intended to deny that request. The board alleged she had not only engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, but also claimed, without elaborating, that she had engaged in a sexual relationship with a client’s spouse and had breached client confidentiality
On May 28, 2025, Klaahsen appealed the board’s notice of intent to deny her application for reinstatement and requested a hearing. She argued she had learned from her mistakes and was successful in her current employment as a hospital discharge planner and had received an award for efficiency, advocacy and excellence.
At a July 29, 2025, hearing on the matter, Klaahsen testified about the therapeutic process she has undergone and the progress that she had made since surrendering her license.
“However,” the board stated in its recent, written hearing decision, “when pressed, Klaahsen would not directly speak about her interactions with B.C. … Instead, Klaahsen placed blame on B.C., a vulnerable client, for her relationship with him, testifying that he was the instigator of their relationship and that she felt ‘obligated’ to send him inappropriate pictures.”
The board commended Klaahsen for her progress but added that it did not believe she had “adequately addressed the issues that led to the voluntary surrender of her social work license.”
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Giovanni Demezier of Dyersville, who agreed to voluntarily surrender his license after being charged with unethical conduct, failure to comply with the national association’s code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a former client. The agreement follows a board decision in May to issue an emergency order suspending his license.
The board alleged that in early 2024, Demezier, while working as a licensed mental health counselor “in and around eastern Iowa,” began providing counseling services to a patient identified by the board as “T.S.” The board alleges that the client-counseling relationship between T.S. and Demezier ended in May 2024, but before that professional relationship ended, the two communicated with each other on Snapchat, with T.S. indicating she wanted something “more” in the relationship.
Demezier allegedly responded that he would have to switch from being a counselor to T.S. to a “coach,” while indicating the two roles were “virtually the same.” The board alleges Demezier then had sex with T.S. in June 2024.
T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father, according to board records. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
Court records show that on May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination. No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also claims that in 2021, Demezier began providing counseling services to a different client, M.R., and made repeated suggestive and flirtatious comments to the client before transitioning from a counseling relationship to “coaching” relationship in August 2023. In October 2024, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual conversation with M.R. via text message.
Demezier is currently being sued for negligence by Michelle Ross, a California woman who alleges that during their therapy sessions, Demezier disclosed information about his past and present clients, sent her late-night text messages, told her he was in “open marriage,” detailed his sexual activities and isolated her by discouraging her from maintaining relationships with her friends and family.
Demezier has denied the allegations. A trial-setting conference is scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
— Amanda Brune, who was recently notified of a board decision to deny her request to have her license reinstated. Board records show that in 2005, Brune, formerly known as Amanda Zwack, was accused of having close, personal relationships with clients and having sexual intercourse with one client while working for New Beginnings in Maquoketa and Clinton. The Iowa Board of Substance Abuse Certification subsequently revoked Brune’s certification.
In 2012, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science issued Brune a license as a mental health counselor. In January 2014, Brune pled guilty to the criminal charge of tampering with records, a charge that the board says stemmed from allegations that she had billed Medicaid for services provided to a family member during periods she was seeing clients for her employer. Brune then agreed to have her counselor’s license placed on probation for two years.
In early 2015, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Science says, the board staff received an anonymous call asking why the board had licensed Brune as a mental health counselor when her certification had been revoked years earlier by the Board of Substance Abuse Certification. The Board of Behavioral Science then checked the IBSAC website, confirmed Brune’s certification had been permanently revoked in May 2005, and then revoked Brune’s license as a mental health counselor.
In March 2025, Brune applied for reinstatement of her mental health counseling license. In June 2025, the board indicated it intended to deny the application, which led to Brune requesting a hearing on the matter. That hearing is now scheduled for Oct. 20, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mental-Health-Counselor-Therapist-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

According to the ICE online detainee locator system, Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts is being held in the Pottawattamie County Jail. The database lists his birth country as Guyana, located in South America.
Des Moines Public Schools Board President Jackie Norris said in a message to the district community that Roberts, the district’s superintendent of more than two years, was detained by ICE Friday morning. Norris said in the message the board has “no confirmed information as to why Dr. Roberts is being detained or the next potential steps.”

Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will “immediately” take on the role of interim superintendent “until further notice,” the message stated, and he has the board’s confidence in his leadership. Smith formerly served in the role during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the message, after which Roberts was hired.
“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” Norris said. “The appointment of Mr. Smith as Interim Superintendent ensures that our District continues to operate at the highest level.”
Norris stated in the message the board will provide updated information once they receive and have confirmed it.
Roberts is a former Olympic Track and Field athlete, according to his LinkedIn account, and started his career in education in 2000. He has served in leadership roles at school districts in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.

(Photo credit: EPA)More than a month after a major industrial fire in Tangipahoa Parish, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released an inventory list identifying the millions of gallons of motor oils, automotive fluids and other petrochemical products at the site. 
The information was made public Thursday, hours after the Illuminator reported the agency was waiting on permission from the executives of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. plant in Roseland that was destroyed in an Aug. 22 chemical fire that took two weeks to completely extinguish. The explosion and blaze sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and a school. Petroleum products also spilled into nearby waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that leads to Lake Pontchartrain.  
Detailed on a 305-page spreadsheet, the list includes a variety of flammable and otherwise hazardous products. Rough estimates indicate Smitty’s Supply stored several million gallons of motor oils, lubricants, antifreeze, coolants, hydraulic fluids, gas mixtures, transmission fluids, methanols, drilling oils, solvents, acids, bases and other petrochemical products. 
With four locations across the South, the company bottles, packages and distributes bulk products to retail stores nationwide on behalf of major brands such as Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State, Chevron and Castro.

Smitty’s Supply also makes and bottles its own Super S brand of petroleum products and, before the fire, had bulk storage tanks on site with 8.7 million gallons of capacity. 
Its Roseland facility, just north of Amite City, also housed a grease manufacturing plant, automated bottling lines, laboratory and testing facilities, three rail spurs, 36 rail cars, a fleet of 18-wheeler trucks and tankers, as well a printing, labeling and packaging line, and other operations across multiple warehouses, according to the company’s website.
The EPA had possession of the list for more than four weeks after obtaining it from Smitty’s Supply on Aug. 27 and initially refused to disclose it to the public. At the time and in response to a reporter’s subsequent requests, the federal agency said it needed to check with the company’s lawyers to ensure the list didn’t contain any “confidential business information” that would be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The law compels government agencies to share qualifying records with the public.
“Legal counsel for Smitty’s Supply provided EPA with an inventory list of the materials at the facility, which was used to inform response operations,” EPA Press Officer Edward Mekeel said Thursday. “The inventory contained off-the-shelf motor oil, antifreeze, degreasers, plasticizers, polymers, and paints. After confirming that the list does not contain Confidential Business Information, EPA is now making the list publicly available.” 
The agency did not immediately respond to follow-up questions sent Thursday afternoon.

DemasA budget framework for the 2025-26 fiscal year is in place, but now the tough work begins, with eyes on Tuesday to produce a final product.
Michigan’s Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday evening announced that they reached a deal to fund the government in a stunning turnaround after months of standoff and stalemate, signaling that the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate worked out their differences and could move forward to avoid a government shutdown.
But the clock is still ticking and, by the respective chamber leaders’ own admission in statements that flew across newsfeeds late last night, there is much work still to be done to hammer out that framework into a full fledged consensus budget plan.
The details of what might make the final plan were still elusive on Friday, even to some key legislators, as leadership on both sides of the aisle were keeping things close to the vest so as to not upset the agreement.
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) speaks to reporters after tentative budget deal is announced. Sept. 25, 2025 | Screenshot
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said as much in a news conference he held after session on Thursday, noting that he could not answer some important questions related to the deal because other key players were absent. Hall also noted that he didn’t want to say anything that might undo the progress made because it was still just a framework – which was atypical for the usually freewheeling speaker.
On the Senate side, details of the framework were also being closely held to vest, said state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor).
It was notable, too, that both the House and Senate held sessions on Friday but both were adjourned quickly without any clear new budget activity. A flurry of unrelated bills were introduced, instead, some with an appropriations focus but those were for supplemental funding to programs that already exist.
Still, the lack of a quorum in the House and Senate shouldn’t be perceived as an early exit.
Communications staff for the House GOP told Michigan Advance on Friday that legislators were still very much meeting on Friday to do additional work on the budget behind the scenes. That included conversations amongst themselves but also with their Democratic colleagues.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Democrats appeared to be fully engaged in those conversations, as well, working at the Capitol and in the respective chamber office buildings negotiating targets and what they might look like. That includes hammering out the details of the school aid budget funding K-12 schools, which is another piece of vital budget information being held closely behind closed doors.
It was a whirlwind of activity following a lot of sitting around for months, but the conversations were bearing fruit and moving along.
The buzz in Lansing was hopeful, and that legislators would have a final deal hammered out to present on Tuesday, Sept. 30, the last day of the current fiscal year.
Of all the twists and turns of Thursday evening, the emergence of a plan to create a wholesale tax on marijuana at 24%, expected to generate $420 million to go toward roads, was an unforeseen development. Proposals to use “pot for potholes” stretched as far back as 2013, and now the House GOP of the 2025 session appeared to be the ones ready to take that plunge.
The House GOP also celebrated its “waste, fraud and abuse” mantra making it into the final budget deal.
Michigan House GOP facing pressure over ‘ghost employees’, but leadership says it’s a real problem

For the Democrats’ part, there was barely a whisper of their supposed wins in the budget deal aside from the decoupling of Michigan’s state and the federal government’s business taxes, a move that would stave off some of the tax cut effects of the congressional One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
But one thing that was missed in Thursday’s announcement was the Democrats successfully protecting the statewide Medicaid exchange in the face of cuts from the federal government. Democrats on Friday touted that as another area where they won in the budget deal.
Another piece of information that caught the attention of those following the budget saga was a report from Bridge Michigan that noted interesting action from the Senate Democrats. The upper chamber’s leaders put forward an amendment on Thursday that would eliminate $500 million in annual funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which was Whitmer’s hallmark economic development engine through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
Bridge also reported that the House GOP put forward a bill to cancel corporate income tax deposits to the fund, opting to use that money toward roads.
Spurring economic growth has been one area that both parties agreed on, even if they differed on the concept of offering state taxpayer dollars as incentives for business attraction that might not bear fruit. The move on Thursday regarding the reserve fund was a sign that both Democrats and Republicans saw a clear need to shift money away from past priorities, and that the use of those state incentives to garner new business activity might be falling out of vogue.

Irwin, in a brief interview with the Advance, said he was still concerned that funding for education, health care and environmental protection could be on the chopping block to cover road funding.
“I haven’t seen the final numbers yet, so I can’t say, but it looks like those things are all going to be subject to cuts as a result of the shift of revenue towards roads,” Irwin said. 
While there will be other forms of revenue brought in to compensate for the increase in funding for roads, the rest will need to come from priority areas, and perhaps local governments.
“That’s kind of where it’s got to come,” Irwin said. “From some of those places. I guess it could come from prisons. … And so that’s concerning.”

Irwin was also critical of House Republicans’ plan to increase revenue by raising the tax on marijuana, arguing the effort would deliver less revenue than projected and would drive individuals toward the illegal market.
“When you drive customers out of the legal market, those are customers who are already contributing to roads, already contributing to K-12 schools, and already contributing to host communities. All of that’s going to be diminished by this action,” Irwin said.
As lawmakers met to solidify their loose deal, constituent and special interest advocacy continued on Friday.
In a news release from the pro-democracy Promote the Vote, the organization applauded the Legislature for getting to a deal, but urged lawmakers to protect election functions as critical infrastructure. The initial House GOP proposal included cuts to the Michigan Department of State and election administration.
Melanie Macey, the group’s policy and government affairs director, said those cuts would potentially threaten the state’s ability to run accessible, secure and efficient elections.
“They weaken election infrastructure and voter confidence, shift costs onto local governments, and would ultimately result in higher long-term costs,” Macey said in a statement. “The cuts would reduce early voting and Election Day support, damage election officials’ ability to provide required services, weaken voter roll maintenance and cybersecurity, and would have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable voters.”

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders officially called a special election Friday to fill the seat of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died earlier this month.
The Republican from Branch represented Senate District 26, which encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian Counties.
The special primary and general elections for the seat will be held on March 3 and Nov. 3 of next year, coinciding with the state’s regular midterm election schedule. If a candidate does not earn enough votes to win their party’s nomination outright, a special runoff election will be held March 31, 2026, the proclamation said.
State law requires that a special primary election be held “not more than” 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
The candidacy filing period for the special election will begin on Nov. 3, 2025, and will close on Nov. 12 at noon. Following the primary, parties must certify their nominee for the general election by Aug. 5, 2026.
Three Republicans have announced their intentions to run as of Friday — businessmen Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both of Paris, and former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
Simon and Tritt originally planned to run for the seat of term-limited Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, who represents House District 46. Three Republicans and no Democrats remain in the race for Eubanks’ seat.

Tritt immediately criticized the decision to hold the general election next November — after the state’s fiscal session in April.
“District 26 deserves to have a voice in every decision that impacts our families, our jobs, and our future,” Tritt wrote on Facebook. “To go through a fiscal session without full representation is simply unacceptable.”
Both he and Simon said they oppose plans for a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, in line with Stubblefield, who was one of the most outspoken critics of the project since it was announced last year. Berry, a military veteran who declined to run again in 2024 after two terms in the House, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he felt it was possible to fund a prison while finding a more suitable location for it.
Both Tritt and Berry also stated their opposition to a potential immigration detention facility at the Franklin County site, after reports emerged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had visited the site Monday and were considering it as a place to hold migrants.
In addition to their positions on the prison, policy priorities for the three ranged from cutting taxes and protecting Second Amendment gun rights to helping rural hospitals, improving workforce development and education.

The case comes amid an outbreak nationwide. So far this year, more than 1,500 people have tested positive, the highest number since the disease was considered eliminated in 2000. Three people have died: two in Texas and one in New Mexico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
South Carolina’s four cases have all come from unvaccinated people in the Upstate who had no immunity from prior infections, according to the department. For privacy reasons, the state does not release how old patients are, where they live or their sex.

Two of the people who tested positive previously had recently been out of the country. One of the cases was a close contact infected by another.
Where the most recent case came from is unclear, the department said in a news release.
The person isolated during the infection to keep the virus from spreading.
This marks the most measles cases in South Carolina since 2018, when the state had an outbreak in which six people tested positive. Before that, the last measles case was in 1997, according to health department data.

The highly infectious disease can be fatal, especially in children. Symptoms include a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually lasts about a week. In severe cases, the virus can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, according to the health department.
Most children receive two doses of a vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella between the ages of 1 and 6, according to the health department. About 94% of South Carolina children began the 2024-2025 school year with all their vaccines, according to health department data.
That’s a decrease from recent years.
During the 2019-2020 school year, more than 96% of students started the year vaccinated. Still, the state remained on par with the level of kindergarteners who received at least one dose of the vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the CDC’s most recent data available.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

If you’re in immediate danger, call 9-1-1.
The University of Utah’s annual campus safety report shows staggering on-campus rape statistics for a second year in a row. However, like last year’s survey, most of the allegations were reported during a single interview with a survivor.
The state’s flagship school accounted for 146 rape cases in 2024, with a former student reporting 110 incidents by a single partner during a “multiple-month relationship plagued by interpersonal violence,” according to a news release from the U.
“Because each is a distinct action, then each counts individually, so that we counted the full 110 which is what the survivor stated that they had,” said Todd Justesen, director of the U’s Clery program, a federally required initiative to disclose campus crime data.

According to the report released on Friday, the survivor didn’t wish to move the case forward, and both people in the relationship have graduated.
This year’s count nearly rivals the university’s 2023 report, which counted 175 rape cases. That year, a single victim also reported being raped 150 times by their intimate partner at the Salt Lake City campus. Both numbers are substantially higher than the 30 cases reported in 2022. 
Chris Linder, a professor and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the university, said that while the numbers may be alarming, they can also help other victims of interpersonal violence to report sexual assault from intimate partners. 
“But many survivors do not come forward and report it as sexual assault, because our culture has constructed the idea of sexual assault as a stranger jumping out of the bushes and snatching us,” Linder said. 
The university doesn’t have exact statistics of accountability in these cases, but a university spokesperson said the school will refer students to different offices depending on whether they’d like to press criminal charges or student discipline, like expelling or suspension while the investigation takes place. 
The report also shows a significant increase in fondling, or inappropriate touching of the groin, buttocks or breasts, including during medical examinations, Justesen said. Fondling instances grew from 55 in 2023 to 83 last year. That included 51 cases at the U of U Health Hospitals and Clinics. 
All reports are counted whether or not the allegation was substantiated and someone was found accountable, Justesen added.



Let us know what you think...


 


The report also showed an increase in other forms of violence. Cases of aggravated assault, which includes any attack to inflict severe bodily injury, tripled from seven in 2023 to 21 last year. That included 14 in health care settings.
The U. also released the results of a campus climate survey on Friday, which aims to understand trends, patterns and needs among students with a focus on sexual harassment and misconduct. The report shows high confidence in bystander intervention during emergencies and a strong understanding of consent in sexual encounters.
University officials saw a silver lining in those results. 
“As we compare our rates to national benchmarks across almost all categories, we’re seeing lower rates of incidents reported for our students,” said Lori McDonald, vice president for student affairs at the university, “the exception to that being among intimate partner violence, which helps us, again as a campus, know that we should continue investing and building on those resources.
The university offers a range of educational programs and events throughout the academic year to better understand healthy relationships and how to intervene in potentially harmful situations, McDonald said. 
There’s a peer wellbeing navigation program available for students, as well as sexual violence resources. Anyone needing help is encouraged to call the 24-hour rape recovery center crisis line at 801-736-4356.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Twenty minutes was all it took for state regulators to cement the seasonal electricity rates that will hike Rhode Island Energy customers’ bills by an average of $22.28 per month for the next six months.
But the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s swift decision Thursday does not preclude the prospect of more discounts on winter utility bills — proposals for up to $180 million in credits on winter gas and electric bills remain under review. In a nod to the rising utility costs — and frustrations of the customers who struggle to pay them — the three-member panel also kicked off a first-of-its-kind request for public comment on other ways to flatten the seasonal price spikes. 
Electric supply rates typically increase every winter, reflecting the regular, seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. But the cyclical rollercoaster has grown more dramatic in recent years because of global unrest and increasing demand for natural gas.
The 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour price that starts Oct. 1 is 16.05% more than existing summer prices. But, it’s nearly 10% less than last winter, and below the record high during the 2022-2023 winter. Little comfort to customers struggling to afford rising bills and to their advocates, many of whom blame Rhode Island Energy for profiting in the face of residents’ financial struggles. 
A winter of discontent? Ratepayers, advocates urge regulators to reject proposed utility hikes

A 206-signature petition submitted to utility regulators earlier this month stressed the contrast between residents “pushed to the brink by unaffordable rates” and the utility supplier’s profits reaching “new highs.” 
PPL Corp, the parent company for Rhode Island Energy, which reported a $183 million profit for the three-month period that ended June 30, including an $8 million quarterly profit specific to its operations in Rhode Island. 
But the Pennsylvania-based corporation’s balance sheet received no boost from the prices it charges for electricity usage in Rhode Island. State law prevents the state utility supplier from boosting its bottom line through usage costs, which must directly reflect the price from third-party suppliers — a point explained in detail by Ron Gerwatowski, commission chairman, during the meeting Thursday. And, state regulators cannot reject proposed seasonal rate increases as long as there is no evidence of extra profits for the company.
“We don’t have the authority to deny the cost recovery because costs are straining affordability,” Gerwatowski said.
He later concluded, “I think the decision is really simple for us. Did they comply with the procurement plan and did they do the rates correctly?”

Finding balance
Less simple is how to soothe the pocketbook pain that will come from the newly approved seasonal electric prices. Rhode Island Energy executives, and later Gov. Dan McKee pitched $154 million in bill credits over the next two winters. The credits, mandated to protect customers from company tax payments tied to its 2022 acquisition of the state utility operations from National Grid, were originally set to be distributed over 40 years. But proponents say concentrating the credits over the first three months of 2026 and 2027 — when customers’ utility bills are highest — would provide more meaningful relief. The discounts, which would slash electric bills $20 to $30 per month while cutting $40 to $50 from monthly gas bills, await final approval from the commission.
Separately, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources has proposed spending $5 million from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program to credit low-income customers in October through December of this year. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative revenue will result in a $45 million credit for eligible customers, according to McKee’s office.
McKee has also asked the commission to come with a scheme to yield another $25 million in discounts by adjusting some of the non-supply-side charges. Even before McKee’s public plea, utility regulators indicated they were open to some tweaks to minimize the “rate shock” that occurs each winter when supply prices rise. A July 21 notice sought public feedback on ways to reduce bill costs during “peak heating months.” The solicitation suggested condensing service charges that fund the company’s investments in energy efficiency,  storm recovery work and renewable energy into an eight-month period — excluding December to March — rather than the existing, 12 months. This would reduce customers’ bills during the period when prices are highest.  
In Massachusetts, state utility regulators and Gov. Maura Healey opted for similar workarounds, including cutting charges on energy efficiency programs to save $500 million for ratepayers. 
Environmental advocates criticized Healey’s decision as short-sighted, risking higher costs in the long-term as climate change worsens and natural gas becomes more unreliable and expensive. Rhode Island environmental and consumer protection groups were skeptical, too, of implementing similar tactics in the Ocean State.
“Rate and bill volatility are increasingly tied to the region’s overdependence upon natural gas for power generation, especially in the winter,” Tina Munter, a policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, wrote in an Aug. 6 letter to the commission. “Overdependence upon natural gas is a fact that can and must be addressed by a long-term, steady commitment to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and demand response.”
Jennifer Wood, executive director at the Rhode Island Center for Justice,  attorney representing the George Wiley Center,  strongly recommended in a separate letter against letting Rhode Island Energy tack on deferral fees to make up for temporarily suspended charges. 
Noting that customers rack up debt for unpaid bills in the winter, Margaret Hogan, legal services administrator for Division of Public Utilities and Carriers — the administrative arm of the state utility agency — expressed concern that shifting costs to the summer would “further exacerbate already difficult collections.”
State utility regulators have not made a decision on which, if any of these approaches to take, awaiting more data from Rhode Island Energy. 
Pandemic debt repayment to end
Debt from unpaid bills is a problem for Rhode Island Energy’s balance sheets — rising more than twofold to $254.9 million as of May 2025, according to written filings submitted by the company — prompting the company to push to suspend a pandemic-era requirement that gave customers more time to pay overdue bills with lower upfront payments. In a separate, unanimous vote Thursday, utility regulators agreed Thursday to the proposal to end its March 2020 order — though not as early as Rhode Island Energy wanted.
The flexible COVID-era debt repayment option will end on Jan. 1, rather than the Dec. 1 expiration the company proposed. The vote mandates that Rhode Island Energy work with the 5,000 customers on the existing pandemic repayment plans to transition to other, permanent repayment options rather than risking shutoff.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, said in an emailed response Friday that the company was “committed to delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy.”
“We recognize that affordability is a significant concern and offer various programs and services to help customers save energy, manage their bills, and access financial assistance,” Dalo said.
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community winter electric rates, which take effect Nov. 1, have not been announced. About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

,DC,2025-09-26 18:59:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here's a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-government-shutdown-nearing-heres-guide-what-expect,,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they're not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that's going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it's going to matter a lot to them. It's going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that's not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.“It's really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. What role does Congress have during a shutdown?The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn't expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” “Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”",,,,2025-09-26 15:56:46.398494

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).After a week of heated exchanges between the leaders of Boeing Defense in St. Louis and the union representing its machinists, the two sides have agreed to resume negotiations Monday.
“The bargaining committees for Boeing and IAM 837 have agreed to return to negotiations on Monday with the help of a federal mediator in an effort to find a path to end the strike,” said Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 in a joint statement Friday afternoon. 
The strike by more than 3,200 union members at Boeing Defense facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Illinois, reached 53 days on Friday. 
The union announced Friday morning it was aiming to ramp up support with a rally on Wednesday, as well as a meeting “soon” with union members and Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
Last week, workers voted to approve a union-proposed contract, after overwhelmingly rejecting Boeing’s previous two settlement offers.
The union’s four-year contract proposal includes a $10,000 ratification bonus instead of the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns of pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits, union leaders said.  
The union’s lead negotiator said the “ball’s in their court,” during a press conference Tuesday on Zoom.
“This union is prepared,” said Jody Bennett, IAM Union resident general vice president, said at a press briefing. “If they want to fly in tonight, I’ll stay up all night. We’ll work on weekends, but we’re here to get something that’s fair and equitable.”
Boeing fired back that their position hadn’t changed from the previous week, after they called the workers’ vote on the union’s proposed offer a “publicity stunt” and a “waste of time.” 
“It’s unfortunate the union led its members to vote on an offer that we didn’t extend or collectively bargain,” said Boeing in a statement Tuesday. 
The company accused Bennett of having “selective memory” on Boeing’s offers, pointing to his statement days before members voted down the company’s original offer in July that the agreement “meets the moment.” 
“We agree with him and remain open to constructive talks within the boundaries of our landmark offer for Midwest manufacturing,” according to the company’s Tuesday statement. 
The union’s proposed ratification bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, said Jonathan Battaglia, spokesman for the IAM Union. However, the 401(k) benefits are the same as those Seattle workers received, he said. 
The Northwest strike lasted 53 days, and the company ultimately conceded on some of the workers’ main requests. 
However, Dan Gillian, Boeing St. Louis vice president of air dominance, said in a statement last week that a contract in St. Louis has to “make sense in the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest.”
Missouri Democratic Congressmen Wesley Bell of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, along with members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, urged Boeing last week to return to the bargaining table. 
Soon after the joint statement was released Friday, Boeing posted a “mythbuster” video of Gillian talking about the wage growth in the company’s offer being “very real.”
During the press conference Tuesday, Bennett said Boeing has repeatedly expressed the company won’t veer from the parameters of its core offer, calling it a “sound offer.”
“However, our members are telling us that’s not the case,” Bennett said. “So we will meet Boeing, but without parameters. You know, the strike’s been going on now seven weeks. We may have to look at this as it’s a brand new negotiation. I would hope not.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-26 14:57:15.852469

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa state parks and state forests will host volunteers Saturday for clean up and maintenance projects in celebration of National Public Lands Day. 
Andy Bartlett, the manager at Ledges State Park near Madrid, said the volunteer events are a way to celebrate public lands in the state, and they help with park maintenance.
Volunteer projects are different at each participating park. Ledges, for example, will lead volunteers to areas of the park that have been taken over by invasive species such as honeysuckle or autumn olive. Volunteers will be given equipment and taught how to remove the plants that would otherwise choke out native species.

Bartlett said Ledges has hosted similar volunteer projects and said each time volunteers are able to see the “immediate impact” of their efforts in the park. 
“By the time we’re done with the project, you have this whole different view of the forest, or the forest edge where we’ve been clearing,” Bartlett said. “It’s kind of satisfying for them to be able to see progress in their work and results immediately with one event.” 
Bartlett said he’s hopeful the Saturday event at Ledges, which begins at 10 a.m. in the Lost Lake Trail parking lot, will draw a crowd of around 50 volunteers. Bartlett said the event is also a “cash in, trash out” or CITO event that allows folks involved in geocaching to earn a virtual souvenir for attending the event. 

Public land owned by the state and managed by Iowa DNR accounts for approximately 1% of Iowa’s 36 million acres. This land comprises the state parks, forests, preserves, recreation areas and lakes that are open to public use. 

While volunteers will be using loppers and other tools to cut down the woody shrubs, Bartlett said there are jobs at the volunteer events in which the whole family can participate. 
Prairie Rose State Park, Lake Darling State Park and Lake MacBride State Park will also host volunteer events geared toward removing invasive species. 
Other parks are asking volunteers to help refurbish picnic tables, pick up trash and debris and assist with other infrastructure maintenance projects. Volunteers at Yellow River State Forest will help to prepare firewood for the forest’s fundraiser firewood sales.  
Bartlett said even one day of volunteer work can help parks check off the projects they haven’t been able to complete on their own. “Any help all of us as managers can get at our areas through volunteers is truly appreciated,” he said.
Specific information on time and meeting location can be found at the state park websites, or on Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ statewide volunteer day page. 
National Public Lands Day has been celebrated on the fourth Saturday of September since 1994. National Parks offer free admission on the day and like Iowa, coordinate dozens of volunteer projects. 
According to the National Park Service, the holiday is a chance for citizens to assemble with a common goal of “stewarding America’s natural resources for future generations to enjoy.” 
Bartlett said the day helps volunteers feel connected to their public lands. Sometimes, he said that means they even get involved with other volunteer events or groups that help take care of the parks. 
“Eventually, we’re creating stewards that not only give back to our park through volunteer labor, but they’re advocates for our park as well,” Bartlett said.

The flight back to Jackson that night in June 2023 was full. I was then serving as an interim pastor in the city after a lifetime away.
I had already boarded the plane and was settled into my seat when a young Black man in sports coat and tie carrying a huge trophy over his head came down the aisle. The trophy was at least four feet tall. About the time he got to my row, a middle-aged white man wearing a cord coat turned around and took the trophy and placed it in an overhead bin. They looked like student and teacher. Or maybe debater and coach. I had been on the debate team in high school and college. It had been a long time ago. But the wardrobe looked the same. 
He took his seat opposite mine on the aisle. Due to plane noise on the small jet and a chatty neighbor next to him, I didn’t have a chance to speak to him until we landed and were standing in the aisle ready to deplane.  
“Nice trophy.”
He won it that morning at a national debate tournament in Phoenix. He was beaming. He should be. I asked where he went to school. He said Jackson Prep. Wow. 
I was part of the Jackson Prep class of 1973. I never went to a national debate tournament. No one from Prep did back then. In college I had teammates who did. But I never went.  There were no Black students at Prep in my days there. The only Black people on campus then were the maintenance and custodial staff. 
Through the years my mother and I talked about changes that happened in Mississippi and the world. She would often end the conversation by saying: “But look how far we have come.” 
My parents were always concerned that I get a “good education.” It was a mantra for them. I think they meant they wanted my brother and me to develop critical thinking and communication skills. But it was otherwise undefined. 
When I was a public Bailey Junior High School seventh grader in 1967, I assumed I’d eventually be at Jackson’s flagship Murrah High School. A Murrah Mustang.

My parents took me and my brother to Murrah football games. They had awesome teams in the late 1960s. A neighbor played for the Mustangs and went on to Georgia Tech to play, or so I was told. I attended the student musicals at Murrah. My parents were friends with the principal and his wife. We had cookouts at each other’s homes along with other friends from church. That was the way it was supposed to be. But it did not last.
Things changed in the 1969-1970 school year. I’m not sure when I first learned about Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court case that ruled “separate but equal” for schools was unconstitutional. There was another case, Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, decided in 1969 that ordered no further community stonewalling. But it was a long time before I knew the name of that case. While it charted my path away from public Murrah High School to private all-white Jackson Prep, it was not a foreordained path. 
Talk about “good education” was everywhere in my white world. I recall my parents sharing their concern with me. They and their friends were concerned that the “new” teachers would not have the necessary skills and attributes to provide the “good education” they wanted for my brother and me. But most of these “new” teachers came from “other” schools. Schools where the students were Black. The teachers were as well. 
As a ninth grader at Bailey, I did not know about these court cases. I heard my parents and other adults talk about the “Court” but did not know specifics. The talk was that schools would be closed after Christmas break (never “winter break” in those days) for three weeks while some plan was drawn up for school attendance in the spring of 1970 and into the next year. There was even a chance I would not finish the year at Bailey. But I did. 
But the high school arrangement would be different. Murrah was paired with Brinkley High School, one of the all-Black high schools in the Jackson Public Schools. On the street where I lived, we said there were five high schools: Murrah, Central, Provine, Wingfield and Callaway. Those were the historically white ones. We didn’t count the “others.” Didn’t compete against them. Didn’t know anyone who went to them. Couldn’t have gotten to them by ourselves. Didn’t know the names of these schools.  So they did not exist in our little bubble of the world. 
But they did exist. Brinkley, Jim Hill and Lanier, schools created for the purpose of segregating Black students, all existed. There were real students who attended, real teachers who taught, real parents concerned about their children’s “good education.” 
I know that growing up my parents taught me the importance of respecting individuals for who and what they were. My father made a medical mission trip to the Eku Hospital in Nigeria in 1968 during the civil war there. My mother was deeply involved in the Women’s Missionary Union at Woodland Hills Baptist Church. They received and entertained missionaries from around the world. It was always understood that racial epithets, slurs and characterizations were not accepted in our home. 
But one evening a group of their church friends came over. A comedian/evangelist had recently spoken at church and sold copies of his LP album: Laughin’ With ‘Em. There was a second album too. My parents bought them. After dinner the guests gathered around the new Fischer stereo console and played the albums. The comedian spoke in dialect. The punch line of each yarn made fun of the Black folk in each story. Just like Amos N’ Andy. Everyone in the room laughed. I was listening from the hallway. No doubt I laughed, too. This form of racism was in the air we breathed and the water we drank on my street in the “Closed Society.” 
My parents were “good people” and respected “all” people. But not accepting that a teacher was capable of providing a “good education” to me or my brother because that teacher was Black was racism. It still is. 
The search for a “good education” took me afield from Mississippi. My parents did not want to give in to the private school bonanza that spread like wildfire in 1970. My mother stopped us from visiting her brother and his family in the early 1960s. She was disturbed by the racist reading material from the John Birch Society that she found everywhere at their house. But they were not prepared in any way for the tidal wave of change that broke in the wake of the Alexander v. Holmes decision. Good intentions and family disagreements take on a different meaning in the eye of a hurricane landmark court case.
Together we found the Darlington School for Boys in Rome, Georgia, where I attended 10th grade as a boarding student. Isn’t it ironic that to avoid going to a segregation academy, I chose to go to an all-white school almost 400 miles away from home?
There were a number of boys from Mississippi whom I met that year. I don’t recall talking about why we were there, though I am sure we did. And I would hazard a guess that it would revolve around “good education.” Of course. There were no Black students at Darlington that year. Irony abounds.
Once I went to the hallway bathroom eager to relieve myself. Standing at the urinal, I looked down on a photo of Martin Luther King Jr. I just left it there. I knew this racist act was wrong. But I lacked the courage to remove it. And I knew the Black custodian could be counted on to clean it up.
Most of my psychic energy during 10th grade at Darlington was used to figure out how to return “home.” Would I attend Murrah as I had always planned? Another option presented itself: Jackson Prep had emerged from the primal slough of the segregation academies. Or at least that’s what those in prosperous, professional northeast Jackson told itself. The rationale was that this school would be different from an academy. A couple of founders were world renowned physicians on the University of Mississippi medical school faculty. This certainly impressed my father and mother. And me as well.
Many prominent businesspeople and professionals had organized the school. As I recall, each student family purchased “stock” which provided capital for the school. On top of that, tuition was paid for each student. As if to emphasize the distinction, the name of Prep did not include “academy.” It was as if the organizers were trying to create distance between Prep and the reality of the time.
“People” said that Jackson needed a “real” option that was a “college preparatory school.” And Jackson Prep was meant to deliver that. I believed it. At least, I wanted to believe it. 
But somehow it rang hollow. There was a gathering of student leaders from around Jackson at the Mississippi Fairgrounds my senior year. Public and private schools sent groups. Another Prep student made a speech that attempted to demonstrate that students, regardless of the school attended, had more similarities than differences. I was moved by his persuasiveness. But his argument was empty rhetoric.
The exodus to private schools I was part of had been prompted by fear of the “other.” The eloquent oratory of a classmate could not stave off the trauma we all were living with. That we all continue to live with.
Many of the “best” faculty from Murrah moved to Prep. The English and drama teacher I had in 11th and 12th grade was one of them. The football coach and most of the white players came to Prep. There was a sense that Prep was a continuation of pre-integration Murrah. I don’t recall talking about the why’s or how’s of that happening. It just was. 
I was glad to be back “home.” There were many students who would have been my classmates at Murrah had we not opted out. Did we talk about this obvious fact? I don’t remember if we did. But I do remember driving by Murrah often as it was on the way to my grandmother’s apartment in Belhaven. The question of what had happened hung in the air. Unspoken. But very real.
When I look back, I see how careful and intentional a lot of our silences were. We Prep transplants wanted to believe we were a cut above academy “rednecks.” In our DNA, though, Prep was as white and as new as the other estimated four thousand white-flight private schools that popped up in the South at the time of integration.
I joined the debate team and participated in dramatic productions; signed up for the Key Club; found a group who played the board game Risk; went to most football games; had my first rum and coke. I wanted to think of myself as an “academic.” Actually, I was a pseudo-intellectual. Or maybe, I was just an awkward teenage boy in a shifting white world. 
All of our parents were middle and upper class. I don’t know what the “stock” buy-in was, nor the amount of tuition, but the costs were considerable. I knew the cost kept some from attending. I heard somewhere that maybe, one day, there would be a Black student at Prep. Maybe. One day. When a Black student had the potential to be a star athlete or win a national debate tournament was found. Then.
There was something Prep offered that Murrah could not. Murrah drew from a set city attendance zone. As a private school, Prep took in white students from beyond northeast Jackson and even outlying towns. The sectional divisions of north, south and west Jackson were quite real. Even among the white population, there was economic and class messaging for each section. In more recent years, a couple of my non-north Jackson classmates told me how awkward they felt due to the weight of class and Jackson social strata. But all of us were white.  
My journey took me to college in Alabama before returning to Ole Miss for grad school. I don’t know when, or even if, I decided I’d become a Mississippi ex-pat. It just happened. There was an invitation to enroll in an Auburn Ph.D. program, a job in North Carolina and then seminary in Kentucky.
I honed an interest in church history, especially how what is said correlates with what is actually done. Unsurprisingly, I suppose, that’s what I’m examining in my own school history here. That focus also led to my book, Religion & Race: Southern Presbyterians 1946-1983 and some published articles on religion, race and faith. 
Along the way my father retired. My parents moved to North Carolina. I found my way back to North Carolina and then to Georgia, where I’ve resided longer than I lived in Mississippi. Yet it is Mississippi, not Georgia, that has always been on my mind.
I wondered if there was a “call” for me to serve as a pastor in Mississippi. There were some conversations and interviews when our sons were school age. No offers were made. Even so the topic my wife and I often turned to in those times was how to provide our children with a “good education.” 
As it happens, I did return to Jackson for a season. I served as the interim pastor of Fondren Presbyterian Church for 18 months. So much had changed. There I found white folk who had stood firm for public schools back in that day. They seem to have found the “good education” my parents sought.
As my mother would say: “Look how far we have come.” 
I would respond: “And look how far we have to go.”

(Julia Goldberg / Source NM)Six months,100 cases and 56,000 vaccines later, New Mexico’s measles outbreak has come to an end.
So said New Mexico health officials on Friday, noting in a news release that the state logged its last case on Aug. 14 in Santa Fe County, meaning more than 42 days have passed without new cases, “a timeframe that represents twice the virus’s maximum incubation period.”
3 new measles cases pushes New Mexico’s total count of infections to 100

NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM the end of the outbreak means the risk of measles spread inside New Mexico is lower. However, “We do still have outbreaks ongoing in states surrounding us, so we will remain vigilant for folks in our state traveling to those areas or folks from those areas traveling to us and will work to detect any imported cases,” he said.
Smelser said vaccine recommendations remain the same: Two doses of the measles vaccine will be the most protective for most people.
New Mexico reported its first measles case on Feb. 11, a Lea County teenager, whose case followed an outbreak in the neighboring Gaines County in Texas. The state subsequently declared an outbreak three days later when two adults in the same county tested positive, meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threshold for constituting an outbreak.
In total, New Mexico’s 100 cases spread across nine counties, with one reported death. Of the cases, 53 were among people 18 years and older; 24 were among people 4-years-old and younger and 23 were among people ages 5 to 17. More than half the cases —57 — were among unvaccinated people. It was the largest outbreak of measles in New Mexico in the past four decades.
Since Feb. 1, more than 56,000 people have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, NMDOH says, which remains “widely available” in the state.
The number of people seeking a vaccine during the outbreak was 61% higher than the number of people who received shots over the same time last year, which Smelser credited for keeping the rate of spread low.
“Folks who came in and got themselves up to date really helped us stop this from getting even worse,” Smelser said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee National Guard troops will be deputized as part of an “accelerated” crime-fighting effort set to start next week in Memphis but will not make arrests or carry weapons unless requested by police, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday.
“Information from the police department … on what support they need will determine and drive whether or not a particular National Guardsman is armed,” he said. 
The governor announced the state will direct $100 million toward a state, federal and local partnership to crack down on crime. Some 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be assigned to the city along with an undetermined number of Guard personnel and more than a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The anti-crime task force will operate “as long as it takes” to make Memphians feel safe to go to a Grizzlies basketball game at the FedEx Forum or Beale Street without fear of being a victim of crime, the governor said.
Even though Lee told reporters a month ago that National Guard deployment wasn’t being considered, he said planning for the operation with Mayor Paul Young and the Trump administration has been taking place for months. 










I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city. 


– Memphis Mayor Paul Young 


National Guard troops are to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, which will oversee the operation, and will play a support role as a “force multiplier,” Lee said. He did not detail the tasks they would take up.
“Never before has a city in the country had access to these resources,” Lee said.
The crime-fighting effort is necessary, he said, to boost economic recruitment and to give relief to residents such as a mother who described to him the loss of her son to street violence.
The governor didn’t declare a state of emergency activating the National Guard but authorized the deployment at the request of the federal government. President Donald Trump recently signed a memorandum directing Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to approve the plan and use of Guard troops.
Asked about the potential for friction between troops and neighborhood residents, Lee said people will understand the support role troops will play when they see them “on the ground.” 
Young said he wants to sustain gains made in cutting crime such as a 13% reduction in overall crime in 2024, a 19% cut in violent crime and 29% reduction in murders, followed by similar figures in 2025.
Shelby County lawmakers torn over National Guard deployment to Memphis

“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the department has been asking for more federal help for several years and added that she wants to make sure “Memphians know the work being done is on their behalf.”
State lawmakers who represent inner-city Memphis have criticized the plan to deploy National Guard troops there.
Talks with FBI Director Kash Patel started this spring, and initially the FBI was to lead the effort in Memphis.
“It was never off the table that the National Guard would be used. But it wasn’t the plan at the time … that this would develop,” Lee said.
As talks unfolded with the Trump administration, the option for federal funding to bring in the National Guard and federal agencies to back local law enforcement made it “evident” that the plan should be put into place, Lee said.
