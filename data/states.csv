Preston Street in Baltimore. (Photo by Elijah Pittman/Maryland Matters)When news headlines spotlight “squatters” occupying homes in Maryland, it’s easy to respond with punitive measures. But usually, behind every story of someone we’re calling a “squatter” occupying a vacant property is a larger crisis: rising housing expenses, declining wages, and a generational commitment to sabotaging our social safety net.
Squatting in Maryland isn’t new, but recent viral videos and sensationalized news stories have raised concerns about it as a growing threat to property owners and neighborhood safety. This framing is misguided. This isn’t about relative “bad actors.” It is about systemic failings forcing people into dire situations.
If we are to understand the causes for the rise of squatting, we must discuss the absence of affordable housing. The Maryland housing market is increasingly out of reach for low- and moderate-income residents. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a full-time worker earning minimum wage in Maryland would need to work 100 hours a week just to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. And it is even worse in Baltimore, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County, with decades of rent increases far outpacing wage growth.
Public investments in housing have simultaneously dwindled. Federal housing assistance has not kept pace with housing needs, and only one in four eligible households will get help. Maryland also has patchy eviction protection policies and inconsistent enforcement. When individuals slip through the cracks, informal housing alternatives, including squatting, emerge as survival practices.

To be clear, squatting is not a permanent fix, nor should it be glorified. However, we have to stop viewing it as an inconvenience to be legally addressed, and instead, tackle the source of the issue: inequity. A large portion of those seeking shelter in vacant structures are leaving unsafe housing conditions, fleeing domestic violence or are recently evicted. Some are young adults leaving foster care. Some are people with disabilities or unemployed. The commonality is affordable and stable housing.
Squatting is then the visible end of an iceberg. The underbelly of that iceberg includes systems flaws, including a stripped-down social safety net, defunding of mental health services and the criminalization of poverty. And Maryland is not alone. All over the country, municipalities are evicting encampments without solutions, states are passing laws to criminalize homelessness, and federal programs are both inadequate.
The erosion of affordable housing is not incidental; it is the result of policy decisions. Since the 1980s, Democratic and Republican administrations have prioritized tax credits for housing development rather than aggressively building deeply affordable public housing and have not established units for the lowest-income sector. We have a plethora of buildings developed through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), but none of the housing is operationalized at the highest need.
Maryland stands at a fork in the road. We can continue excursions in pathologizing poverty and depend upon law enforcement to make them go away. Or we can truly invest in good, durable options, such as expanding Housing First programs, establishing statewide rent stabilization policies, and building deeply affordable housing, not just housing for young people/new workers or market-rate apartments with several units subsidized.
This will take political will and courage. This will mean rejecting the notion that housing instability and homelessness are the consequence of individual dysfunction. This will mean accepting that housing, beyond being a commodity, is a human right.
We also must stop using the term “squatters” and implying that they are “stealing” homes. In most cases, these homes have been abandoned – some in foreclosure limbo, and most owned by absentee owners. The real theft is not around people working to survive; it is a lack of accountability for not honoring the public will to care for others.
If Maryland truly wants to be a model on this front, it cannot rely solely on viral fear-based slogans or strategic, piecemealed solutions, but instead needs an audacious, justice-based housing agenda that prioritizes that all individuals, no matter income levels, have a safe and secure place they can call home.
Squatting is not an epidemic. Inequity is the epidemic. If we want to stop homeless neighbors from occupying vacant buildings and homes, we need to give them real homes.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC03645-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-05 11:00:36.272081

But the myth of the loner, tough guy, and emotionally disconnected stoic is the topic of a new memoir, written by notable Montana author Russell Rowland, who also writes a bimonthly column for the Daily Montanan.
“Be A Man: Raised in the Shadow of Cowboys” chronicles Rowland’s life from upbringing to his adulthood in which he struggles with growing up, becoming a man and assimilating into the West, where every male must live up to that archetype, which Rowland said is an untrue creation of Hollywood.
Rowland grew up on a ranch in Wyoming, not far from the Montana border, before moving to Billings. His memoir paints a picture of a father who was aloof and an alcoholic, coupled with a mother with a fiery temper who would avoid discussing the painful parts of life.
That led to Rowland’s own isolation, alcoholism and a pool of anger that would burst out occasionally as rage. The memoir is part explanation, part outreach to let others — especially men — know the manly cowboy image is far from the truth.
Instead, the book also holds up the ideal of working together against a wide-open and sometimes unforgiving environment, relying on community and family, and developing a comfort with feelings. Rowland said those discoveries have taken him more than 20 years of writing and rewriting before finishing the memoir. Along the way, he’s also cut out several passages, rewritten other parts, making it less of a vendetta against the past and those who harmed him, and more about seeing the unreal expectations that the West places on its men.

“We also seem to have this idea that abusive men are incurable,” Rowland said.
He watched the transformation of his father, especially after he quit drinking — a story that replayed itself in Rowland’s life. That transformation that began with sobriety also led to deeper understanding about what is possible.
“This is to let other men and women know that I experienced and overcame uncontrollable anger,” Rowland said. “I wanted to explore where it came from, and why it seemed like I couldn’t stop.”
From a very early age, Rowland said he kept repeating a pattern of frustration, tension and tantrums.
“I had no tools,” he said. “It just didn’t go away. I would replay sh-t in my head until it just exploded.”
He lived in the shadow of his father, who Rowland said was “perpetually unsatisfied by his life” and parents who seemed to always be quarreling.
“My father would just distance himself,” he said.
Rowland’s mother is still living, and he said it was a challenge to write the stories honestly, as it was a challenge for her to read it.
Her reaction has been a mix of feeling horrible and not remembering some of the incidents.
“Naturally, she was concerned with what other people would think,” Rowland said.
Even though his father didn’t live long enough to see “Be A Man” make it into print, Rowland said he’s pretty sure he knows what he’d think.
“I think Dad would have had an easier time with it. He was actually pretty open-minded once he got sober,” Rowland said.
Both father and son trying to live a life of sobriety would sometimes lead to talking about the past.
“We had a lot of pretty frank conversations,” Rowland said. “I just decided the issues were important. The question of how to treat women and develop friendship with other men — we didn’t learn how to do that. We don’t do that in the West.”
What finally nudged Rowland toward finishing the book was during researching what has been arguably his most successful book, “56 Counties” — a travelogue and history of Montana’s 56 counties. It was during researching the history of Montana that he discovered something that struck him: Early pioneer men didn’t quite fit that pattern of stoic, hardened cowboy that is often portrayed.
“They were way more emotionally vulnerable than I had expected,” Rowland said.
Instead, Rowland blames a traveling writer from the East, Owen Wister, who wrote “The Virginian,” which became a runaway success more than a century ago, and the template for many cowboy or western-themed novels, movies and songs.
During research for the book, Rowland said he watched many western films — something he had done often. But this time it was different. He noticed different things.
“I was shocked at how often men would beat women on screen — just smack them around,” he said. “I noticed how often they weren’t married, or didn’t have a girlfriend. And, even when they would kiss a woman, they would just grab the woman and kiss them.
“Men didn’t know how to develop relationships not just with women, but with other men.”
He realize that this was the archetype or character that not only was admired by those living in the West, but the type of person many parents encouraged their young men to emulate.
“The cowboy myth is that if you’re a real man, if you got your sh-t together, nothing bothers you. But nobody is like that,” Rowland said. “We have one of the highest rates of suicide in the nation, especially men in rural communities who aren’t allowed to deal with their problems or what’s troubling them.”
He said that led to a life defined by one emotion, anger.
“I didn’t know how to talk about feelings,” he said. “I had to learn a whole new language.”
That came after he joined the United States Navy and got in trouble while fighting on a ship. The captain recommended he seek some counseling for his anger.
That meant confronting the brokenness in his own relationships, including being a combative if not abusive husband.
“It gave me empathy for my victims,” he said. “That’s not fun. That was tough. You have to realize that you hurt people that you were supposed to be protecting.”
Rowland hopes that by sharing his stories — even the difficult or unflattering ones — that it will give the strength to other men isolated by anger to seek connection and healing.
Ironically, it was working through the mythology of the cowboy that gave Rowland a new appreciation for those things in the western culture that are more savory.
“There are good qualities including perseverance and the ability to adapt and change that come from our Western heritage,” Rowland said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Be-a-Man-Russell-Rowland-scaled-e1751570894673-1024x923.jpg,,,2025-07-05 11:00:36.272081

The detention center was opened on June 16, and, with a capacity of 1,800, the facility has been called the largest detention center in the Midwest, as well as the subject of several earlier protests this year. 
The Independence Day event was organized by local immigrant advocacy groups, including No Detention Centers in Michigan, Cosecha Michigan, GR Rapid Response to ICE, and Lakeshore Rapid Response to ICE.

The date was an intentional choice: July 4, the media release noted, is a day for “reflecting on freedom as an ideal and spending time with family and loved ones.” As such, advocates gathered outside the facility to highlight the apparent disconnect between Independence Day and mass incarceration.
Speakers used the event to emphasize the controversies surrounding the GEO Group— the federally contracted private company that operates the North Lake facility.
As the nation’s primary prison operator, GEO has been scrutinized for influencing immigration and criminal justice policy in ways that expand incarceration for profit.
During the 2024 election cycle, GEO and its subsidiaries donated almost $1,000,000 to political candidates, with around 90% of funds going to GOP candidates. 
In particular, the GEO Group has closely aligned itself with President Donald Trump. Trump’s first term saw 237 new contracts between GEO and the federal government. Furthermore, nearly 71% of the GEO Group’s funding is sourced from ICE. The Trump Administration’s emphasis on mass detention only serves to benefit the GEO Group.
Indeed, the Trump Administration’s budget bill allotted $170 billion to immigration enforcement and detention, with $45 billion earmarked specifically for detention facilities like North Lake.

The People’s Assembly of Detroit was unable to attend the event, but sent a statement that was read aloud at the protest addressing the June 30 ICE arrests on Detroit’s west side resulting in the arrest and detention of Marcos Fabian Arita Bautista, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras 
The group was formed earlier this year in response to the influx of anti-immigrant rhetoric and action and works to provide ongoing support, legal counsel, and mutual aid to families impacted by detention and deportation of their loved ones. Additionally, the People’s Assembly has established a network throughout the area, reaching out to schools, community groups, clubs, and churches.
In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, ICE described Bautista as an “illegal alien from Honduras who had been removed twice from the U.S.” 
Bautista first came to the U.S. in 2015. He was then deported to Honduras. He returned in 2018 and was subsequently deported for a second time. ICE also noted that, in 2022, Bautista pleaded guilty to driving an unregistered vehicle, operating without required financial responsibility, and assigning improper title in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. 
While ICE’s remarks provide a concise timeline of events, the People’s Assembly offered additional context. The group said Bautista was on his way to work June 30 when he noticed ICE agents were following him, at which point he returned to his home and family. Despite the efforts of neighbors and community advocates, ICE broke down the door, entered the home, and detained Bautista.
In recounting the events, the People’s Assembly elaborated on what this experience was like for the family.
”ICE didn’t care about terrorizing the children. ICE had their sniper guns pointed at a little girl’s bedroom window in the house with young children and Marcos’ pregnant sister inside,” the statement read. “ICE didn’t care about anything. ICE broke the door down violently and invaded the house without permission. ICE has not allowed him to speak with his family at all this week.”
However, the statement went on to add that the family and the community are grateful for the demonstrations of bravery and solidarity.
“This is what we all need to be doing right now,” the message concluded.  “We have to rise up together against fascism, violence, and racism. We have to show that we, the people, do not want more detention centers. We want our community to be cared for, and for families to be able to work, play, worship, and learn in safety and peace.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor’s office)Slow revenue growth continues to pinch state budgets across the country, leading governors to propose spending cuts, hiring freezes and some tax increases.
In its spring survey of states, the National Association of State Budget Officers found that general fund spending will hold steady in fiscal 2026 as states expect limited revenue growth but increased costs.
Though most states are meeting or exceeding 2025 revenue projections, a growing number are downgrading their revenue expectations for the next fiscal year, Shelby Kerns, executive director of the national association, said in a news release.
“In a number of states, we’re seeing expenditure projections outpacing revenue growth, forcing policymakers to make hard choices in order to balance their budgets,” Kerns said.
Iowa’s revenue shortfall becomes political fodder for 2026 campaign

States typically wrap up budget work by the end of June, with the next fiscal year beginning July 1. Kerns said the organization anticipates states may need to make mid-year budget adjustments depending on upcoming federal changes in tax policy and spending.
In recent years, many states have been flush with an influx of federal pandemic aid and strong tax revenues from a booming national economy. But with the end of pandemic aid, an uncertain economic future and deep cuts to state taxes, many lawmakers this year confronted major budget challenges in statehouses.
Just weeks after signing a budget that required deep spending cuts and increased taxes, Washington Democratic state Gov. Bob Ferguson told state agencies to prepare for even more belt tightening.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” said a June 4 memo from the governor’s budget director to agency leaders, according to the Washington State Standard.
Still, many states continue to tout major levels of reserve funds.
The National Association of State Budget Officers found at least 30 states expect to maintain a rainy-day fund balance exceeding 10% of their general fund expenditures. This year, 29 states grew their reserve funds, with the majority of states expected to continue to grow their savings next fiscal year.
In Tennessee, general fund revenue growth is slowing, but state leaders were able to rely on $1.5 billion in unspent state funds and $700 million in interest earnings from federal pandemic funds, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Despite tighter fiscal conditions, states overall remain in a solid fiscal position with rainy day funds at near all-time highs, low debt levels, and strong credit ratings,” David Thurman, Tennessee’s budget director and current association president, said in the group’s news release.

Alaska figures prominently in a new U.S. Geological Survey report about oil and gas potential on the nation's federal lands. (Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)About half of what’s known as “the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable” oil lying below federal lands is in Alaska, as is more than a quarter of estimated natural gas, according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey.
The national total estimate for this category of resources on federal lands is about 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the USGS report.
Of that, almost 14.5 billion barrels of oil is in Alaska, with 14 billion of that amount on the North Slope, according to the report. Of these estimates of natural gas on federal lands across the nation, about 111 trillion cubic feet is believed to be in Alaska, with almost all of that on the North Slope as well, according to the report.
Technically recoverable oil refers to the amount that could be recovered through existing technology, regardless of economics. The category differs from economically recoverable oil. And the report only considers what is “undiscovered” — that is, what has not been drilled, but is estimated to exist based on the current knowledge of the geology.
The new report comes as the Trump administration is pushing for expanded oil development on federal territory in Alaska, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, both on the North Slope.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Department of the Interior, said in a statement. “Thanks to the USGS’s rigorous and independent assessment, we’re better equipped to manage America’s vast public lands responsibly while supporting energy security and economic opportunity.” 
The UGSG report, part of a periodic series authorized by laws enacted in 2000 and 2005, uses data from several past resource estimates. Those past recourse estimates generally used different parameters.
A 1998 report issued by the service estimated that U.S. federal lands held 7.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable but undiscovered oil and 201.1 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable but undiscovered natural gas.
However, that 1998 report considered only conventional oil and natural gas. It did not include unconventional resources — shale oil and what’s known as “tight” oil and gas, trapped in impermeable rock, as well as coal-bed gas – that are now produced through fracking techniques.
The new report includes those unconventional types of oil and gas.
The Alaska estimates in the new report are in line with other past USGS estimates for the state.
The most recent report on estimated technically recoverable reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge had a mean estimate of 7.7 billion barrels for the federal lands within the refuge. That estimate, in a report issued in 2016, excluded Native-owned lands and state territory.
A 2017 USGS report that focused largely on the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska had a mean estimate of 8.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. That report was specifically about the Nanushuk and Torok geologic formations, which lie mostly in the reserve but also extend to state lands. The Willow project being developed by ConocoPhillips is within the reserve and holds oil from the Nanushuk formation. The Pikka project being developed by Santos and Repsol, located on state land just outside the reserve, also holds Nanushuk oil.
The new report splits estimated Alaska resources by geography. While the vast majority of estimated resources are attributed to the North Slope, the report presents estimates for technically recoverable resources in Central Alaska and Southern Alaska as well. For federal lands in Central Alaska, which includes Interior and Western Alaska, the total for oil is 100 million barrels and the total for natural gas is 3.2 trillion cubic feet, according to the report. For federal lands in Southern Alaska, which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula, the oil total is 299 million barrels and the natural gas total is about 3.75 trillion cubic feet, according to the report.

The nonprofit dedicated to bridging the tech and digital divide in Mississippi focused on AI’s real world impact with talks, virtual sessions, classes and hands-on workshops throughout the month. At this closing event, a suite of eight vehicles parked outside offered a low-key intro to the breadth of EV possibilities. 
Bean Path founder and CEO Nashlie Sephus brought her own 2023 Rivian R1T all-electric pickup to the show-and-tell, pointing out features like the Gear Tunnel where she can stash groceries, a flashlight and speaker that can pop out, a spacious front truck, an air compressor on the back, and plugs and outlets all around. 
“I’m a truck girl,” said Sephus, a principal AI scientist at Amazon Web Services, and also a gardener and a frequent traveler between her Atlanta office and native Jackson. An EV that can haul stuff, make the distance on one charge and work nicely for daily use ticked the boxes. 
She highlighted AI features, too, such as Amazon Alexa, automatic raising or lowering depending on terrain, navigation aid (helpful with Atlanta traffic, she said) and automatic battery cooldown if it anticipates a stop to charge. 
So, it does the thinking for you? “It tries to,” she said. “That’s what AI is supposed to do.” 
In a state rating among the lowest for EV registrations, the show was a chance to chat candidly with dealership reps and private owners, get a closer look and get pictures, too.

Jaden Luckett, 25, was all smiles for photos, sitting behind the wheel of a Porsche Taycan brought by Porsche Jackson. Trying it on for size, he happily reported a good fit and pictured his 1-year-old, Jakari, in the back seat. Could he see one of these in his driveway someday? 
“First, I got to get a driveway,” he joked. But, this opened his mind to possibilities.
Porsche Jackson General Sales Manager Lewis BeCoats said, “This helps us help the community, to show what we have and then get other people exposed to fully electric vehicles, and the advantage they have in your life once you accept them in.” He brought the Taycan and Macan EV, and zoomed through a quick list of benefits, including the absence of oil and filter changes.
Range anxiety and charging opportunities were hot topics for questions. Travelers want to be able to fill up and drive all the way to their destination, BeCoats said, but “there’s not many cars that do that on gas.” 
Rest stops are also a good time to recharge the EV. “As long as you plan, it’s the perfect vehicle.” People are often quick to embrace the quiet, smooth ride and performance, he said. And, “for those who are green leaf people, it doesn’t put any emissions into the atmosphere.”

Mart Shearer’s “Use Lightning, Not Dinosaurs” T-shirt fit the occasion as he leaned against his small blue 2017 BMW i3 (his second EV) and talked up its suitability for an urban commuter. Fuel efficiency and gas savings started him on this road back in 2003 with a Toyota Prius Hybrid, and he had been looking at EVs since 2012. When an electric smart car turned up at the Mercedes dealer in 2019, he drove up for a look. It didn’t have much charge, they told him, but a turn around the lot was all it took. 
“Just in the drive around the parking lot, every problem with the gasoline version of the car was gone.”
A member of EV Mississippi car club on social media, Shearer sees a pretty rapid adoption rate for EVs for a predominantly rural state. 
“There are places like Jackson or Southaven or the Golden Triangle or the Gulf Coast, you see EVs everywhere,” he said, noting that even a small town Mississippi police department added a Tesla to its patrol fleet. “That tells you somebody made the calculations, ‘Is this going to save money for the public?’ and the answer is ‘Yes.’” 
Chargers will come, Shearer said. Jackson just added 10 new public chargers in June. “People look at public charging and we need more of it,” he said, “but the reality is, most of your charging is done at home in your own driveway, unless you live in an apartment.” 
“Cute, isn’t it?” Celestial Gordon-Griffin said, admiring the breezy blue and white Volkswagen Buzz, sporty Porche Taycan and more. “I’m always so in awe about everything that the Bean Path is doing.” 
She is keen to have her two teenagers realize the importance of tech. 
“My son loves to play video games, and I keep telling him if he learns how to code, he can build his own… I want him to just get bitten by the bug.” She hoped this EV focus could capitalize on his fascination with cars, plus, “Knowing that we’re really doing our part for global warming … It’s really good to see this.”
Making emerging technologies approachable and non-intimidating is key at the Bean Path, as is targeting those who usually lack access and exposure to them. 
“We cover senior adults, we cover our K-12, we also cover our mom and pop shops, our small business owners, our startup companies,” Sephus said. 
“We meet people where they are,”  zeroing in on their core interests to show technology links and spark curiosity. “That’s how we build our ecosystem here in Mississippi.”
Cameron Wilson, a volunteer with American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) was on hand as a ChatGPT coach, helping those at computer stations craft questions for generative AI to write a story, start a nonprofit to solve a community problem or start a business. 
“The biggest thing that I say is to not be afraid of technology, and to use it for positive and good things.
“The hardest thing to do is start,” he said. “Once you get the question in the door, and you see that ChatGPT really has the power to give you in-depth details, it’s just using your imagination and going from there.”
Brittany Myburgh of Family STEAM Day partner Mississippi AI Collaborative noticed the growth from 2024’s first AI Month, when many needed a basic AI 101 course, to participants’ growing confidence and curiosity for specific applications this year. 
“It feels like there is momentum. There’s a movement.”
Retiree Jesse Huffman was among those catching the wave. He learned about working a laser, 3D printing and drone flying at the Bean Path, and now enjoys projects on his own printer and flies his own drone. 
“There’s some knowledge down here at the Bean Path,” said Huffman, who helped himself to it. “I tell everybody, it’s just like a gym, though instead of exercising your muscles, you exercise your brain.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03154937/NashlieSephustruck1.jpeg,,,2025-07-05 10:01:42.247144

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed 139 employees on administrative leave Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed, after they signed a “Stand Up for Science” petition using their official titles and EPA positions.
The affected employees received an email, shared with Inside Climate News, informing them that they are on leave through July 17, pending an investigation into whether they used work time or resources when signing the petition.
The email emphasizes that “this is not a disciplinary action.”
One employee, who asked not to be named, said they signed the petition “on a Sunday on my own device.”
“I’d be shocked if anyone used work resources,” the employee went on. “We’ve taken ethics training and are aware of the law.”
While the employees are on leave, they are prohibited from using government equipment, including cell phones, logging into government-issued computers, contacting any EPA employees for access to information and performing any official EPA duties.
An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency “has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November.”
The EPA also alleged that the petition contains misleading information, but did not specify what is incorrect.
The petition, addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and members of Congress, is a “declaration of dissent” with the administration’s policies, “including those that undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
“Since the Agency’s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished this mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people,” the petition reads. “Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration’s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise.”
More than 200 EPA employees, including retirees, signed the petition, some of them only by initials. The document criticizes the agency for “undermining the public trust” by issuing misleading statements in press releases, such as referring to EPA grants as “green slush funds” and praising “clean coal as beautiful.”
The petition also accuses the administration of “ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters,” most notably regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.
Health-based regulatory standards are being repealed or reconsidered, including drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever chemicals” that cause cancer.
“The decisions of the current administration frequently contradict the peer-reviewed research and recommendations of Agency experts. Such contradiction undermines EPA’s reputation as a trusted scientific authority. Make no mistake: your actions endanger public health and erode scientific progress—not only in America—but around the world.”
Signatories also lambasted the EPA for reversing progress on environmental justice, including the cancellation of billions of grant dollars to underserved communities and the removal of EJScreen, a mapping analysis tool that allowed the public to see pollution sources, neighborhood demographics and health data.










“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like.”


– Nicole Cantello, American Federation of Government Employees


The petition also opposes the dismantling of the Office of Research and Development, whose work forms the scientific basis for federal rulemaking.
Nicole Cantello is president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union Local 704, and leader of AFGE Council 238, a nationwide union that represents over 8,000 EPA employees.
She said the EPA’s allegations are baseless.
“These are trumped-up charges against EPA employees because they made a political statement the Trump administration did not like,” Cantello said. “Now the Trump administration is retaliating against them.”
Cantello said the union will fight for the employees on several legal grounds, including First Amendment protections and employment contractual rights. “We’ll be using all of them to defend our people,” she said.
Matthew Tejada, the former director of the EPA’s environmental justice program and currently senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the Trump administration for going after the EPA employees who signed the letter.
These civil servants, he said, were “totally within their rights” to speak out. “This is a public declaration by those employees that they continue to fight to do their jobs to help people across this country live healthier, safer, more prosperous lives,” Tejada said.
Tejada emphasized that the individuals involved were not working in coordination with advocacy groups, but acting independently in defense of the agency’s mission and the public interest.
He called the administration’s reaction “another indication that this administration is unique in modern times for having zero regard for the Constitution, for protecting and supporting the people of the United States.”
“We are in completely unprecedented waters here,” Tejada said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS_firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1.jpg,,,2025-07-05 09:03:50.043782

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.











America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.


– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System



In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Those are the findings of new Census numbers that show the number of Marylanders age 65 and older grew by 3.35% from 2023 to 2024, while the number of those under age 18 fell by 0.06%. Nationally, the increase of older adults rose 3.1% while those under 18 shrank by 0.10%.
The state’s population overall rose by more than 45,000 last year, the most since 2015. While the one-year numbers are relatively small, analysts say they continue recent trends: The country’s median age and the population’s share of older adults are both continuously increasing.
“Children still outnumber older adults in the United States, despite a decline in births this decade,” Lauren Bowers, chief of the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Branch, said in a statement. “However, the gap is narrowing as baby boomers continue to age into their retirement years.”
The number of states where those over age 65 now outnumber children has grown from just three in 2020 to 11 in 2024, though Maryland is not yet one of those states.
While the state’s 6.2 million residents overall are aging slightly faster than the rest of the U.S., some of the fastest aging is occurring in central Maryland counties, while some of the rural counties are seeing their populations age differently.

In Western Maryland counties like Allegany and Washington, for example, or Somerset and Talbot counties on the Eastern Shore, the 65-and-over population rose less than 2% year to year. And the median age fell or stayed the same in all four counties.
Among counties with rising median ages, Howard County saw the largest increase, going from 39.9 years in 2023 to 40.3 in 2024, according to the Census data.
Jie Chen, director of the University of Maryland, College Park’s Center on Aging, said the aging disparity between rural and urban areas stems from differences in resources. Most communities that can work to make themselves age-friendly tend to be in urban areas, she said.
“The rural areas usually have worse access to health care, housing and transportation,” Chen said. The lack of rural hospitals can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment for older residents, she said.
She said communities are aging primarily due to advancing technology and the state’s improving economy.
“People live happier and longer,” said Chen, also the chair of the university’s Health Policy and Management department. “It’s not a bad thing.”
But, Chen added, the declining birthrate among young people has led to the state’s disproportionate ratio of older and younger residents. She attributed that decrease in birthrate to cultural shifts and reluctance to start a family given the high cost of living.
Chen said there is plenty room for improvement in how resources are allocated for aging residents, especially in the health care system, to ensure aging residents can live happily and healthily “without sacrificing anyone else’s benefits.”

Benjamin Orr, president of the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said the trend is nothing surprising.
“The United States as a whole, our population is getting older,” Orr said. “Maryland’s population is no exception.”
Orr said the goal is for the state to have a healthy “working age” and under-18 population, but the state doesn’t need “explosive growth” in those groups.
An aging population can lead to slower economic growth, he said, and shifting government spending priorities as the state covers increasing health care and Medicare costs.
“We also know that people who are still in the workforce typically pay more taxes,” Orr said. “So an aging population can put further strain on government budgets, not just because they may need more services, but also because they may be paying” less payroll taxes or not spending as much.
Orr added that Maryland is already doing many of the right things to attract working age adults and young families, such as a higher minimum wage and good public schools.
The Census data also showed a continuing shift in Maryland’s racial demographics over the last five years.
Since 2020, the state’s Hispanic population has increased by almost 14%, while its Black and Asian populations saw more moderate increases. The number of non-Hispanic white residents shrank by more than 100,000 people, while the state’s Hispanic population last year alone grew by about 30,000 people.
In an interview with Maryland Matters, Bowers said the trend in Maryland also mirrors the rest of the country. Since 2020, the U.S. Hispanic population has increased by just more than 6 million people, she said.

When the online review platform Yelp added a “Black-owned” tag in 2020, it boosted the visibility of Black-owned restaurants in Detroit. It also caused their ratings to drop, according to our recent study.
Both local and nonlocal reviewers who showed awareness of a restaurant’s Black ownership rated restaurants 3.03 stars on average. Those who did not acknowledge Black ownership gave a rating of 3.78 stars on average. The tag seems to have caused the average rating to drop by attracting more reviewers who were aware of Black ownership.
 Why it matters

Technology companies often introduce new features and tools to influence user behavior and make their platforms more usable.
Although Yelp intended to support Black communities with the Black-owned tag, the design intervention was harmful to Black restaurant owners in Detroit because Yelp failed to consider platform and community-based factors that significantly shape user interactions.
Yelp’s user base is predominantly white, educated and affluent. Making Detroit’s Black-owned restaurants more visible to Yelp users may have amplified cross-cultural interactions and frictions. For example, non-Black users sometimes mentioned “slower” and “rude” service as justifications for lower ratings. Close readings of these reviews hinted at intercultural and communicative clashes.
And even businesses that don’t select the tag are identified within searches as Black-owned, based on user reviews and relevant links. Yelp doesn’t provide a way for the business to opt out of these search results.
 How we did our work

To examine the local impacts of Yelp’s Black-owned tag, we collected over 250,000 Yelp reviews of Black- and non-Black-owned restaurants in Detroit and Los Angeles.
We identified Black-owned restaurants through community-sourced lists for Detroit and Los Angeles and then generated a random sample for the non-Black-owned restaurants.
We then identified reviews that explicitly noted “Black ownership” for closer analysis.
Detroit’s Black-owned businesses saw a greater loss in business compared with “ownership-unreported” restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means they also potentially had more to gain from the new tag.
We found the awareness of Black ownership on Yelp significantly increased following Yelp’s addition of the Black-owned tag in June 2020. A year after the tag was added, reviews in Detroit mentioned Black ownership 4.3% more often than a year before it was rolled out.
﻿
Detroit Black-owned restaurants also saw a small temporary spike in their number of reviews, largely around the time Yelp added the Black-owned tag. At the same time, the restaurants’ average star ratings dropped from 3.91 to 3.88. In contrast, non-Black-owned restaurants’ ratings stayed relatively steady at 3.90.
This metric is an aggregate of all Detroit restaurants’ Yelp reviews over their entire existence, so a .03-star rating change is small but significant.
Even minor changes to star ratings affect the number of diners restaurants attract, their earning potential and the likelihood they will sell out of food.
Adding obstacles in digital platforms serves to reproduce and amplify inequalities these businesses already face, rather than alleviate them. For example, Black-owned businesses have a harder time getting loans and are relatively underrepresented in Michigan as a whole.
These findings may seem surprising given that Detroit is a majority Black city. However, Black users on Yelp are a minority. Keeping in mind the skewed user base of Yelp, we hypothesize the lower reviews for businesses featuring a Black-owned tag reflect existing racial and digital divides in the city.
﻿
Generally, our study provides additional evidence that digital interventions are not “one-size-fits-all,” nor is digital visibility inherently positive for all businesses.
The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Department of Commerce’s announcement that it will withdraw from an agreement with Mexico controlling tomato imports is being applauded by Florida lawmakers, who say it will allow Florida and other U.S. farmers to catch up to what the agency has labeled “unfairly produced Mexican imports.” 
But the proposal is fiercely opposed by lawmakers in Arizona and Texas, who claim the tariff being placed on Mexican tomatoes will harm their own economies and provide consumers with less choice and higher prices.
There’s no question that right now the winners in this situation are Florida tomato growers, who for years have been calling upon the Commerce Department to terminate the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement (TSA).
They contend that growers in Mexico have been selling their products at below U.S. market prices — a practice known as “dumping.” The Commerce Department’s decision, announced in April, means there will soon be a 17.09% tariff on Mexican tomatoes, which now dominate the U.S. market.
“The termination of the suspension agreement will allow U.S. tomato growers to compete fairly in the marketplace,” reads a letter penned by Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody and a dozen Florida Republican U.S. House members upon the announcement that the TSA will be terminated.
“This has been a priority of ours for years in Florida,” added North Central Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack in a separate statement. “For half a decade now, our producers have been subject to an unfair marketplace. In the past five years alone, Mexican tomato producers have violated the suspension agreement over 100 times. The economic impact of these violations has been catastrophic on our domestic tomato producers.”
No one disputes that the industry isn’t what it once was in the Sunshine State. Industry officials observe that going back to when the first Tomato Suspension Agreement was reached in the mid-1990s, there were almost 300 tomato producers in Florida. Now they say, there’s just a few more than 30.

“There have been over 100 incidents documented of violations by the Mexicans by the Commerce Department, so this is just a reoccurring problem that has devastated our industry,” said Tony DiMare, president of DiMare Fresh, a produce repacking and distributing company that started business in Boston 97 years ago and has maintained shipping operations in both California and Florida for decades.
In 2023, Florida produced $494 million of fresh market tomatoes, according to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.  That’s second only to California in the U.S. However, the Golden State tomatoes are primarily used for processing into products like ketchup, tomato paste and other sauces, whereas most of Florida’s tomato crops are for fresh market consumption.
Although the Commerce Department’s decision to kill the TSA is a welcome boost for tomato growers in Florida, Georgia, and other states in the South that grow tomatoes, it’s been denounced elsewhere, specifically Arizona and Texas. U.S. importers there they say the tariffs will result in higher costs for them, leading to higher prices for consumers.
Last month, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a resolution encouraging the Department of Commerce to maintain the existing TSA rather than terminate it. In April, Arizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego sent his own letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, calling upon him to keep the suspension agreement in place.
“The result of terminating this agreement will be higher prices for American families, few options at the grocery store, and fewer American jobs. Indeed, studies show that families could see tomato prices rise by an average of 50% if your Department does not reverse course,” Sen. Gallego wrote.
Officials in those states also cite an economic analysis from Texas A&M University, published earlier this year, estimating the direct and indirect economic benefits associated with the import and sale of Mexican fresh tomatoes in the U.S. at $8.33 billion, with fresh tomato imports supporting more than 46,000 full- and part-time jobs across the United States.
Robert Guenther, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange (FTE), says that the termination of the TSA will allow U.S. growers to stay in business, keep people employed, and save family farms. And he insists that consumers won’t be hit with higher prices.
“We do not expect any significant changes with retail prices for consumers with the termination of the agreement,” he told NPR last month.
DiMare noted that when the TSA was terminated for four months in 2019, “prices actually went down at that period of time.” And he rejects terming the penalty on Mexican tomatoes a tariff. He insists it’s an anti-dumping penalty for violating U.S. trade law.
“When we negotiate all of these fair trade agreements, there are parameters,” he said. “There are guidelines with which trading countries have to comply, and if those guidelines are not adhered to and rules are broken, there are penalties. And the penalties in this case for numerous years of violations of adhering to the minimum reference price is the anti-dumping duties.”
 The greenhouse revolution
The first Tomato Suspension Agreement between the United States and Mexico was enacted on Nov. 1, 1996, nearly three years after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) began. The rules evolved following an antidumping investigation aimed at detecting whether fresh tomatoes from Mexico were being sold at less than fair market value.
Under the ’96 TSA, Mexican producers agreed to sell fresh tomatoes in the United States at set reference prices, with the U.S. suspending the anti-dumping investigation. Since then, revised suspension agreements were reached in 2002, 2008, 2013, and most recently on Sept. 19, 2019.
In 2023, FTE, the Florida exchange, asked the Department of Commerce to terminate the 2019 agreement, saying lingering loopholes remained a problem.
“It’s become clear that these agreements are simply not enforceable, at least when it comes to the tomato trade with Mexico,” said Michael Schadler, then-executive vice president of the FTE. “Suspension agreements might be an effective tool for products that can be kept in storage until market conditions improve but, for highly perishable items like fresh tomatoes, there is just too much incentive to evade the reference prices when markets are oversupplied.”
However, representatives from other parts of the country argue the tomato market has evolved since the mid 1990s, when the first suspension agreement went into effect. Mexican imports have superseded Florida’s home-grown tomatoes because of what they call the “greenhouse revolution” — a new way of farming embraced by Mexican, Canadian, and some U.S. tomato growers, but not in Florida.
By the early 2020s, greenhouse tomatoes represented 60% of the total fresh tomato import volume, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). By investing in greenhouse technology, Mexican growers have been able to grow specialty tomatoes versus the mainly round tomatoes produced in Florida, said Skip Hulett, chief legal officer of NatureSweet, a Texas company that grows and sells greenhouse tomatoes in Mexico and the United States.
“The market has evolved dramatically since 1995-1996, and so consumers now expect the greenhouse-grown vine-ripe varieties, like the grape and the cherry, many of which didn’t exist in the ’90s,” he said.
“The domestic growers who petitioned Commerce for duties have failed to innovate, growing what in the industry are called ‘gas green tomatoes’ or round tomatoes that are picked green and then induced to turn a pale red after being placed in gas rooms and exposed to ethylene gas,” the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas says in a press release. “This kind of tomato has lost market share as consumers and restaurants have shifted to tomato varieties that naturally ripen on the plant, just like in nature, with a natural deep red color and superior flavor.”
DiMare objects to that claim.
“Yes, the Mexican industry has shifted their way of growing to a greenhouse product, but the actual production of the type of tomatoes is the same, whether it’s greenhouse produced or open field produced,” he said. “A round tomato is a round tomato. A Roma tomato is a Roma tomato. And we all share and compete at times in the marketplace with our products.”
 A matter of taste
William Alexander is the author of 2022’s “Ten Tomatoes that Changed the World,” a history of the tomato. He argues the problem with Florida tomatoes is that they’re “not bred to taste good.”
“These are green and rock hard and they’re bred for all kinds of things — to look pretty, to look fresh after they’re sliced, to look exactly the right size to withstand all of the horrible weather that you can have in Florida, and they’re not able to do all of that and also to breed for flavor,” he told the Phoenix.
Alexander recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, contending that the “last thing that American consumers need is a revitalization of Florida’s withering tomato industry.”
Florida’s natural environment isn’t conducive to producing great tomatoes, Alexander says, referring to the fact that they’re grown in sandy soil. “That sand never freezes, unlike a New Jersey field, and so it never kills off things like nematodes” he said.
For his part, Robert Guenther of the Florida Tomato Exchange told NPR recently that “there are no differences between quality, freshness, taste of tomatoes.”
With the clock ticking before the TSA is officially terminated, the lobbying is expected to prove intense on both sides of the issue. Whether that will result in a higher price of tomatoes is unclear.
“We certainly anticipate that if the tariffs do go into effect,” said Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Alliance, a membership trade association representing greenhouse producers growing fruits and vegetables in a controlled indoor environment.
“That’s not going to happen,” DiMare insists. “I don’t see that prices are going to escalate because the agreement is going to terminate.”
The termination of the TSA is set for July 14.

So pulses quickened when Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, won New York's Democratic mayoral primary","New York City mayoral dandidate Zohran Mamdani celebrates his Democratic primary victory with leaders and members of a number of city labor unions. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Maryland is traditionally a top-down state politically.
Until recently, the state’s political landscape has been dominated by senior Democrats, whose centrist, establishment politics continue to hold sway in the State House and in many local governments. Young, aspiring politicians are frequently told, implicitly if not explicitly, to wait their turn before seeking higher office. Even in a state legislature with Democratic supermajorities, progressive initiatives are often held at bay.
So the pulses of young progressives in Maryland quickened considerably last week when a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, Zohran Mamdani, emerged as the unlikely victor in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City and is now the frontrunner in the November general election. And the Democratic establishment and donor class, in the city and beyond, are assessing whether to embrace Mamdani and his movement or continue strategizing for ways to suppress it.
“It’s certainly an exciting moment because it’s a people-powered victory very clearly – an underdog story,” said Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink (D), a leading progressive voice in local and state politics. “Any time we see a number of people engaged and able to defeat big money, it’s important to take note of that.”
It’s hard to extrapolate much from a single local election – especially one in such a unique environment as The Big Apple, where Mamdani’s principal primary opponent was the uniquely flawed former governor, Andrew Cuomo. But pundits across the political spectrum are calling the primary results an earthquake – and earthquakes can have reverberations far from their fault lines.
As the 2026 election cycle heats up in Maryland, and as Democrats here and nationally continue to reel from the 2024 election and its profound implications, it’s worth examining whether Mamdani’s message and winning coalition provide some lessons that can be applied here.
A parade — of speakers — and a hint of rain at annual Hoyer bull roast, but no hints on his plans

Mamdani’s victory was partly generational and partly ideological. The state assemblyman from Queens had an expansive economic agenda that focused on affordability and the New Yorkers who are struggling to survive in a hyper-expensive city. He highlighted proposals for rent freezes, free transit, affordable child care and government-sponsored grocery stores in food deserts, among others.
Mamdani’s thoroughly modern campaign, fueled by nontraditional media outreach, produced an array of responses from Maryland political leaders on social media last week.
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), a fellow Indian-American, offered congratulations on X to Mamdani “and everyone who fought alongside him. You stood up for the underdog – and won.”
Ian Miller, a 23-year-old member of the Baltimore County Democratic Central Committee who has frequently clashed with party insiders, on Facebook called Mamdani’s victory “the Gen Z Obama moment.”
Former U.S. Rep. John Delaney (D) offered a more nuanced analysis on X, recognizing Mamdani’s appeal to “base” Democratic voters, but asking, “How do people reconcile the fact that (more centrist) Andrew Cuomo’s campaign was funded by mega donors and he won the low income neighborhoods and (more progressive) Zohran’s campaign was grass roots and he won the wealthy neighborhoods?”
Some national political analysts said they saw Mamdani’s victory as reflecting economic jitters across all classes – and the pent-up frustrations of younger Democrats who don’t see senior party leaders standing up to President Trump and other MAGA Republicans. Do some of the same conditions exist on the ground in Maryland that helped propel Mamdani to victory? Where can political parallels be drawn between New York and the Free State?
Larry Stafford, executive director of the group Progressive Maryland, said New York voters produced results that have already been evident in pockets of Maryland in recent years.
“I see this victory as part of a trend that’s emerging,” he said. “Like a lot of movements, first it goes forward, then it stumbles back, then it moves forward again.”
Generational change
There is no question that Maryland is in the midst of a generational shift politically. It began with the departures of Attorney General Joe Curran (D) and Comptroller (and former governor) William Donald Schaefer (D) following the 2006 election, and has accelerated with the retirements of multiterm U.S. Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D) and Ben Cardin (D), the deaths of record-serving House Speaker Michael Busch (D) and Senate President Mike Miller (D), the defeat of four senior members of the state Senate in 2018 Democratic primaries, and the retirements of three Democratic members of Maryland’s U.S. House delegation last year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state made history in 2022 by electing its first Black governor and attorney general, its first female state comptroller and its first woman of color to serve as lieutenant governor – each considerably younger than their predecessors. Two of the state’s new members of Congress, Reps. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-3rd) and Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), are 36 and 42, respectively. Brandon Scott was the youngest mayor of Baltimore ever elected in 2020, when he was 36 years old.
With the swearing in of a new member last month, the 11-person Prince George’s County Council now has five millennials, led by full-throated progressives Ed Burroughs (D) and Krystal Oriadha (D).
Four years ago, there were none.
“I think that’s to the benefit of the county because we have a younger population,” said Councilmember Tom Dernoga (D), who is 66. “I think it’s better that we reflect the population than with older folks like me, and I’ll be retiring soon so I’ll be replaced by someone younger and we’ll be skewing even younger.”
There have been distinct progressive victories in Democratic primaries over the years in Maryland – some representing significant upsets – though they haven’t necessarily changed the overall political arc of the state.
One such political victory came in 2006, when constitutional law professor Jamie Raskin ousted veteran Montgomery County state Sen. Ida Ruben in the Democratic primary. Now a congressman, Raskin has since become an icon of the left nationally.
Another came in 2018, when former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a lifelong progressive activist and Bernie Sanders acolyte, defeated more established Democratic politicians in the primary for governor. Jealous’ victory came on the same night that a 27-year-old bartender named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked a top congressional Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley, in the New York Democratic primary – so Jealous never quite got his due, especially after losing the general election that year.
“The national landscape never took note of that victory as much,” Stafford said.
That same year, an avowed democratic socialist, Marc Elrich, was elected Montgomery County executive, narrowly defeating a self-funding multimillionaire in the process – and narrowly beating him again in a rematch four years later. Prince George’s voters recently elected a longtime political outsider, Aisha Braveboy (D), as county executive – though it remains to be seen if she will govern as far to the left as some of her allies on the county council would like her to.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) won election at the age of 44, with big ideas to alleviate childhood poverty, create an equitable economy and tackle generational challenges like climate change. But constricted by budgetary challenges, some of his own cautious impulses, and institutional roadblocks in Annapolis, the governor has found that transformational change isn’t all that easy.
Stafford predicted that Maryland progressives will take the winning formulas of certain successful candidates, along with Mamdani’s, and apply it to the upcoming election cycle – and to working with allies inside and out of government.
“It will look different than it has in the past,” he said. “The coalitions will look different.”
Mink, the Montgomery County councilmember, said she believes progressive policy progress can be achieved more easily at the local level than in the State House, because there aren’t so many powerful forces working in opposition.
“It’s much easier to secure a people-powered win at the county level,” she said.
‘Hell yes, it emboldens me’
One 2026 Democratic candidate who is already making the generational case against a long-time incumbent is Harry Jarin, the small business owner and volunteer firefighter who is challenging 86-year-old U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving Democrat in the House of Representatives. Asked in an interview last week whether Mamdani’s victory emboldens him, Jarin replied, “Hell yes, it emboldens me.”
Jarin said that even if Mamdani’s policy prescriptions didn’t appeal to every voter, “he tapped into that insecurity that a lot of younger voters feel and the feeling that establishment Democrats haven’t done anything to address it. It’s voters rejecting the status quo, just as they did in November when they elected Donald Trump. And right now, the establishment Democrats are the status quo.”
Hoyer has not yet said whether he will seek a 23rd full term next year, and several elected officials, including some with close ties to the veteran lawmaker, could jump into a race to replace him. But Jarin said he’s ready to pivot if circumstances change without having to change his strategy.
“Even if he does drop out, I expect he’ll try to shove some other establishment Democrat with no real-world experience down our throats,” Jarin said. “To me, this has never been just about age. For me this has always been about the need to reconnect the Democratic Party with the working class electorate it has lost ground with and continues to lose ground with.
“It makes no difference if my opponent is 86 or 31. My message will be the same: We need people with experience away from the political system to serve in office,” he said.
Another key race where Mamdani’s playbook could come into play is in the Democratic primary to replace Elrich as Montgomery County executive, where Councilmember Will Jawando (D), who is running with Elrich’s endorsement, is almost certain to stake out multiple positions to the left of his principal opponents – who by most standards are pretty liberal themselves.
“The path to success is through people power,” said Mink, who has also endorsed Jawando’s bid for executive. “People are very hungry for electeds whose words, whose actions, whose opinions match the urgency of what’s happening on the ground. There’s important lessons to be learned from New York.”

It took a little time for Greg Freeman’s debut record to really make its mark. 
The Burlington-based singer-songwriter released “I Looked Out” in July 2022 on the tiny Oregon label Bud Tapes to little fanfare and sparse reviews. About five months later, Freeman and his band took the record on tour outside of Vermont. 
By then, the album had begun to develop a following, an authentic word-of-mouth success that has gradually picked up steam, making Freeman something of a cult figure among those in the know.
“The reception was pretty slow building, I guess,” Freeman said recently, reclining on the porch of his Burlington home, one of the many faded clapboard houses that line the city’s downtown streets. 
Just a few weeks prior, the Vermont musician had returned from his first extended tour in Europe, where he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout he generated.
“People came to the Paris show,” Freeman said, nodding happily. “The England shows that we did were really great too.”  
This past fall, Freeman was signed to Canvasback, an imprint of Transgressive Records, which promptly reissued “I Looked Out” on vinyl. 
In August, the label is releasing Freeman’s second LP, “Burnover,” which is poised to be a career defining success, the kind of thing you could hear blasting in dorm rooms and dive bars alike for the rest of the year.

It’s a sprawling, dreamlike collection of elegant indie gems and hard rock epics, anchored by razor sharp guitar riffs and the distinctly airy voice that has earned Freeman comparisons to Neil Young and Jason Molina, of Songs: Ohia fame.
Freeman said he wrote a good portion of the album in a single sprint, a month long period after his first tour for “I Looked Out” that he spent hunkering down with his guitar back in Vermont.
“I just woke up in this house every day, and everyone was at work, and I played music and watched movies all day long,” Freeman said, looking across his porch. “I think once you do that for long enough, things start flowing better.”  
Shortly thereafter, a steady stream of retrospective praise for his debut and raucous live performances began to lay a long runway for the new album’s arrival.
Last spring, he and his band appeared at South by Southwest and were singled out in subsequent coverage of the Texas music festival. 
Write ups in Paste, Stereogum and Rolling Stone have since followed, with some heralding Freeman as the next MJ Lenderman — the 26-year old Asheville-based musician and current golden boy of indie rock. 
Freeman has also been getting invitations to share the stage with larger names. Prior to his jaunt in Europe, he supported Walkmen singer Hamilton Leithausser for a stretch of his solo tour, and in the Fall he’ll be opening for the iconic indie band Grandaddy for a series of shows in the Northeast. 


Freeman grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, playing guitar in his room while nursing an obsession with traditional blues greats like Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson from an early age. 
The White Stripes, with their Son House covers and blues-inflected garage jams, served as a gateway drug from the early masters to the classic rock and contemporary indie records that Freeman began to favor more throughout high school and college. “That was the first, like, contemporary band that I was super into,” he said.
Before attending the University of Vermont, he took a gap year and played alone at open mics across the country, often sleeping in his car as he hopped from town to town. 
When Freeman finally arrived in Burlington in 2017, he was bowled over by the vitality of the local music scene. “I came here and everyone was in bands, and there was so much music everywhere,” Freeman said. “That was really a first for me.” 
Freeman joined the fray, playing basement shows before moving up to venues like Radio Bean and Artsriot, where he mostly performed as a solo artist backed by many of the musicians that remain in his band today.
In the years since, Freeman has stayed around the Queen City, becoming a mainstay in the city’s burgeoning indie scene alongside friends and contemporaries like the band Robber Robber and singer-songwriter Lily Seabird, who played with Freeman’s band for several years. 
With its tight-knit social scene and sprawling bucolic surroundings, Burlington is, for Freeman, a city of contradictions that has given him much of his material. Scraps of overheard dialogue make it into his work, as do shades of the more complicated social dynamics that come with living in such a small city.
“There’s kind of like a suffocating social environment here sometimes,” he said, grinning. “But then there’s also, you know, so much green, beautiful space.” 
The odd contrast is something Freeman said he tried to evoke in Burnover. For all its catchy hooks and colorful guitars, the record is a study in the peculiar feeling of loneliness that you get from never quite being alone. 
“My thoughts die out slowly on the blood swept plains / where I see you every night,” Freeman sings on “Curtain,” one of the singles from the record.
Rejecting the term “concept album,” Freeman said that “Burnover” was more intentionally cohesive than his last, with sonic motifs and language that recur throughout.
“I want you to be able to visualize a certain place when you listen to the whole thing,” he said. 
The place isn’t Vermont or New England exactly, he said, but something similar, something green, gothic, weird.
“I’m always kind of trying to write about the places where I live — the spaces around me and the people around me,” he said.
Accordingly, whatever comes after “Burnover” could represent a change of pace for the Vermont musician. 
Before he accompanied Leithauser on tour, he headed to New Mexico, where he spent almost a month alone in the desert, writing the bulk of what will be his third album. 
“It was pretty out there,” Freeman said. 
He returned home with a batch of new songs, but his sojourn out west hasn’t made him want to leave. For now, he said, he would be in Burlington for the foreseeable future.
“It’s weird, though, how much has happened in this neighborhood,” he said as he peered down the road. “I’ve lived on all these streets.”

The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.

As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.

The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Thirty years after wolves were brought back from near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, the state of Idaho is back in the wolf-killing business.
Based on direction from the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60% over six years.
According to the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028, the state’s goal is to reduce the wolf population down from the estimated average of 1,270 wolves to a new average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves.
Based on the population dynamics in Idaho’s wolf population, the state estimates humans would need to kill about 37% of Idaho’s estimated wolf population each year for six years to reach the goal of an average population of 500 wolves
While nearly everyone in the wolf debate says it’s extremely difficult to get an accurate count of the animals within the state’s borders, some wolf advocates don’t agree with Idaho officials on how many wolves are actually in the state due to the research methods used until recently.
And some worry that if the state doesn’t have an accurate wolf population count, it doesn’t know how many wolves should be killed under the management plan.
 Current wolf hunting, trapping policies a grim reminder of eradication campaign from the past, early wolf member of wolf management team says

Idaho legislators are driving the policy by responding to concerns from farmers and ranchers who have had animals like sheep and cattle killed by wolves.
Between 2014 and 2023, wolves in Idaho killed a minimum of 1,291 domestic livestock animals, according to state records. The losses affected 299 different ranchers and farmers.
But for Marcie Carter, one of the early members of the Nez Perce Tribe’s program that managed wolves in Idaho, the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping and the government-sponsored killing of wolves in Idaho is a grim reminder of the eradication campaign that nearly killed off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1940s.
Wolves are a native species in Idaho and all across the U.S. But as setters moved West, the U.S. government passed wolf-killing bounties meant to encourage westward expansion. By 1926, rangers had killed the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The last wolf in Idaho was killed in the 1930s, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
In one of the most successful and controversial wildlife comeback stories in American history, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone and Idaho in 1995.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” said Carter, who now works as the watershed coordinator for the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries Resource Management.
 The impact of wolves on livestock in Idaho

Having livestock killed is a big deal to the rancher who owns that animal.
But some wolf advocates say that, big picture, the number of livestock killed by wolves is pretty low every year.
From 2018 to 2022, there were an average of 259 livestock deaths each year in Idaho that were deemed “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. (Depredation is the term officials use when a predator like a wolf kills or maims livestock like cattle. Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said “confirmed” or “probable” determinations are dependent on sufficient evidence remaining, which is dependent on very rapid detection and investigation of the carcass and minimal disturbance by scavengers. Those criteria often aren’t met in remote environments, therefore the documented “confirmed” and “probable” depredations should be considered a minimum number, Fish and Game officials said.)
That’s in a state with about 2.5 million head of cattle and 235,000 sheep – including on feedlots and dairies where wolves and other predators are not present. 
That means wolves kill an average of about 0.01% of Idaho’s combined cattle and sheep population each year.
 How does Idaho estimate its wolf population?

All sides in the wolf debate agree it is extremely difficult to produce an exact population count of wolves in Idaho.
The state is too big, the terrain is too rugged and wolves are too elusive for that to happen.
Instead, officials use multiple different techniques to estimate that wolf population.
Until recently, Idaho Fish and Game officials used wildlife trail cameras and a statistical model to estimate the state’s wolf population.
Some outside researchers expressed concern with the accuracy of using wildlife cameras to estimate wolf populations.
Scott Creel, an ecologist and conservation biologist who works for Montana State University, has studied carnivores since 1987 and studied wolf-elk interactions since the 1990s.
Creel has been critical of wolf population methods used in Montana and Idaho.
“I was frustrated with seeing methods being used to estimate wolf numbers that were very indirect and, in my opinion, were unlikely to produce accurate estimates,” Creel said. “I was particularly worried that the methods I was seeing used would produce estimates that wouldn’t change, even if the wolf numbers were really changing. So the wolf population would appear to be constant, even though the policy changed just because of the way we were counting them, which is extremely oblique in both of the two methods that I was reviewing.”

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks declined an interview request for this story.
Creel stressed that accurately estimating wolf populations is extremely difficult.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials disagree with Creel’s criticism, but acknowledged trail cam population estimation methods become less reliable when the number of images of wolves from the trail cameras declines.
In July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game announced a new wolf population estimation procedure.
Instead of using trail cams, officials are using new methods involving combination of genetic and information taken from a tooth of every wolf mortality documented by the state, information on the biological range of wolf population dynamics, a statistical model, and actual wolf hunting and mortality data.
It’s called the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation, which Idaho Fish and Game officials said has been used widely in other scientific fields like epidemiology and population genetics. Biometricians use that method to estimate the total number of new litters of wolf pups each year and the average estimated wolf population.
When he introduced the new wolf population estimate in July 2024, Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts said the new population estimation method independently produced similar population estimates to the trail cam method’s population estimates from 2019 to 2022 using different data.
Roberts said that gives him confidence the new method produces consistent and reasonable population estimates. He also said it backs up the old trail cam method that outside researchers have publicly criticized.
“Although no population estimation technique is perfect, we now have an independent source of information that validates the camera-based estimates that we’ve been using to guide wolf management since 2019 and refutes the idea that those estimates are wildly erroneous, as some have claimed,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
But for 2023, the trail cam method and the new method produced different population estimates.
The new method estimated 1,150 wolves, while the trail cam method estimated 840 wolves, Roberts said.
Even though it has been a year since Idaho Fish and Game officials announced their new estimation methods, the methods do not appear on the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s website for public review.
Howl reporters Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin asked Idaho Fish and Game officials for a copy of the state’s new methods for estimating the wolf population.
In March, Fish and Game officials said the only available information is a YouTube video of officials announcing their wolf population presentation. The relevant discussion takes place more than four hours into a six-hour Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting on July 24, 2024.
Officials said they are working to publish their methods.
“We are in the process of preparing a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication on the method, which we hope to have submitted for publication later this spring or early summer,” Roberts said in March.
As of June 24, the department had not yet published its new wolf population estimation methods in a peer-reviewed publication. Roberts said June 24 that officials are close to submitting it and hope to have it submitted for peer-reviewed publication before the upcoming July 17 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
Despite questions and criticisms of past methods, Roberts said he is confident in using the new population estimation to drive wolf management decisions in Idaho.
“Because we were able to produce five years of virtually identical estimates between (the new methods) and the camera-based methods we’ve used before, we are confident this transition will result in consistent information to inform wolf management in the state,” Roberts said during the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting.
 Why Idaho’s wolf population estimate is important

Bob Crabtree, who founded the Yellowstone Ecological Research Center, said accuracy in wolf population estimates is extremely important.
“It’s like asking a business owner to try to make a profit or try to avoid losing money by not knowing what items they have on the shelves that they stock in their store,” Crabtree said. “Population size, or abundance, is the No. 1 criteria used to successfully manage and conserve and restore wolves. And without it, you just can’t.”
Many wolf laws and policies rely on wolf population estimates.
State Sen. Van Burtenshaw, a Republican rancher from the town of Terreton, Idaho, sponsored Senate Bill 1211, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law in 2021.
The law removed the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters could buy each year, legalized wolf trapping year round on private property and allowed the state of Idaho to contract with federal agencies and other third parties to kill wolves.
Burtenshaw said he pushed for the law because his constituents told him there are too many wolves eating too much livestock.
“The big thing was the amount of farmers and ranchers that were dealing with significant losses because of the wolf population,” Burtenshaw said. “Originally when the wolf was reintroduced, they were talking about 150 or something in the Idaho region. And we had well over 1,500, almost 1,600, for a long time. So the depredation cost was huge to those that had livestock and other animals as well.”
“That population has kind of got out of balance, and that’s what we’re trying to figure out is where that balance is,” Burtenshaw said.
 The impact of wolf hunting in Idaho

Idaho sold more than 53,000 wolf tags to hunters in 2023 even though there are only an estimated 1,150 wolves in the state, according to documents provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
More than half of those wolf tags were sold in the popular “sportsman’s package,” which includes a hunting/fishing combo license and tags for deer, elk, bear, wolf, mountain lion, turkey, salmon and steelhead. (State officials said they do not know the percentage of hunters who bought a wolf tag because wolves are the primary animal they are hunting vs. the percentage of hunters who primarily hunted other animal species but still bought a wolf tag.)
From the 2019-20 wolf hunting season through the 2023-24 hunting season, hunters and trappers killed an average of more than 400 wolves a year in Idaho, according to Idaho Fish and Game.
In addition to expanding wolf hunting and trapping, Idaho also financially reimburses expenses for hunters who successfully kill a wolf.
Since 2019, the state of Idaho has paid out $849,750 in reimbursements to successful wolf hunters, according to data provided by the Idaho Fish and Game.
The money is Idaho Fish and Game funding that is transferred to the Wolf Depredation Control Board for the Foundation for Wildlife Management’s reimbursement program, Fish and Game officials said. Separately, the foundation has applied for and received Idaho Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants.
“Our end (goal) in this originally was focused on trying to direct the harvest where we were seeing the greatest impacts – chronic livestock depredation, elk populations below objective, where predation was a factor – to try to focus that effort where harvest at that time was not sufficient to stabilize the wolf numbers,” said Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director of Operations Jon Rachael, who was an original member of the wolf recovery team.
In the context of hunting, the word harvest means successfully killing a game animal such as a wolf.
The reimbursement money can be used for firearms, ammo, traps, trail cameras, gear, license fees, fuel and even ATV vehicles used to scout or hunt wolves, according to the foundation.
Rusty Kramer, the president of the Idaho Trappers Association, said he has used state reimbursement money to make payments on his truck, which he uses when he is tracking and trapping wolves.
The standard reimbursement in Idaho is capped at $750 per wolf.
But in areas where elk populations are below their objective, or livestock have been repeatedly killed by wolves, the reimbursement limit increases to $2,000 per wolf.
Some wolf supporters call the program a bounty system and scoff at the idea of the state sending checks to people who shot wolves to help pay off their trucks and ATVs.
But Idaho Fish and Game officials insist it is only a reimbursement program – not a bounty.
“Any of the funds that come from the state of Idaho, from the Wolf Depredation Control Board, or, in the past, from the Fish and Game Commission Challenge Grants did require that this money was not just a straight payment of a certain amount, but rather the individual claiming compensation present evidence of their expenses,” Rachael said. “And so in that regard, it was compensation for their investment of buying traps or fuel to run a trap line.”
 U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed it killed juvenile wolves in Idaho

When the state kills wolves, it doesn’t just kill adult wolves that are confirmed to have attacked livestock.
The state, other government agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and third party contractors can kill wolf pups in their dens and their nursing mother – even if those specific wolves never attacked a cow or sheep.
“You can kill wolf puppies,” said Carter Niemeyer, a former government trapper who helped bring wolves back to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park 30 years ago and opposes killing wolf pups and many of Idaho’s wolf policies. “They’re plum legal if you kill them at a day old. Stomp their head in with your boot if you want to.”

Students at Timberline High School in Boise spoke out a few years ago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services killed wolf pups from a pack that the school symbolically adopted, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In an October 2021 letter to Suzanne Asha Stone, a prominent Idaho wolf expert and a member of the wolf reintroduction team, former U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Jenny Lester Moffitt, confirmed the government killed eight juvenile wolves in Idaho in an attempt to relocate the larger pack and reduce the number of livestock killed.
Carter, who was on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf reintroduction team in the 1990s, is sickened that the state would authorize the killing of wolf pups that never disturbed livestock.
“I mean, it’s one thing to shoot an adult,” Carter said. “But to trap puppies in the den hole? It’s just so awful. And I don’t understand how people can be that hateful to one species of animal that has a right to be here. But for sure, the state has not done their due diligence.”
“I‘ll just stop there,” Carter added. “The state of Idaho is not taking care of this species.”
Since wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011, the USDA Wildlife Services and other agencies have killed 961 wolves in Idaho, according to Idaho Department of Fish and Game documents.

Since 2018, Idaho Fish and Game has spent $817,668 on lethal control actions to kill wolves in Idaho, according to documents the department provided. That total specifically refers to Idaho Fish and Game funding through the Wolf Depredation Control Board that was not spent on reimbursements made by the Foundation for Wildlife Management.
One of Idaho’s policies is that even when nonlethal tools are available to reduce conflicts between livestock and wolves, the state can kill wolves without first trying the nonlethal tools.
“Livestock producers may use deterrents to aid in protecting their property; however, they are not a prerequisite for lethal removal,” the Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2028 states. “Regardless of use or success of nonlethal methods, landowners may request a special kill permit from IDFG for use on lawfully permitted public and private lands. IDFG will continue to employ lethal removal as needed to address both individual depredations and overall population goals”
 30 years after wolf reintroduction, some of the people who brought wolves back worry about their future

Longtime wolf advocates say the government-sponsored killing of wolves and expansions in hunting and trapping is reducing the number of wolves.
Now, 30 years after the first wolves were returned to Idaho and 14 years after they came off the Endangered Species List, several prominent members of the team that brought wolves back worry about the threats wolves face today.
Niemeyer is a longtime government trapper who has tracked wolves across Idaho and Montana since before reintroduction in 1995. Intimately familiar with wolves, he was a member of the team that traveled to Canada 30 years ago to capture wolves to reintroduce them to Idaho and Montana.
For years after reintroduction, Carter studied the packs and knew the location of many dens in central Idaho.
Niemeyer was so confident in his ability to find wolves that he regularly guided donors who supported conservation organizations into the wild to see wolves.  He knew the landscape well enough he could set up camp just close enough for the donors to see and howl for wolves as Niemeyer cooked cowboy-style dinners for the group.
But those days are over.
Over the last few years, Niemeyer said he and his longtime contacts are no longer seeing wolves in the wild the same places they always used to.
“When they’re in there, they see virtually little or no sign of any wolf existence in the Frank,” Niemeyer said, referring to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. “If you put together what I’m seeing, or better yet, what I’m not seeing…. Nobody’s finding any wolf evidence. So where are these 1,300 or 1,500 wolves?”
Niemeyer’s luck isn’t any better than his friends.
During a Howl reporting trip in July 2024, Niemeyer found wolf scat and wolf tracks, but no wolves. And during another, separate expedition in 2024, he said he struck out entirely – he didn’t even see a wolf track.
“The Big Buck Pack, Steel Mountain Pack, Jackson Pack, Archie Pack, I can name all these packs up there, Thorn Creek – there’s no packs in those places anymore, mostly because of domestic sheep that came in there and Wildlife Services just went to hammering wolves,” Niemeyer said. “And then you’ve got the recreational hunting and trapping that started when (wolves) were delisted.”
“You’ll still find a wolf track up in that country,” Niemeyer said. “But to say there’s anything like the numbers there were, I don’t believe it. You wouldn’t convince me.”
Carter worries about new expanded wolf hunting, trapping and lethal control policies in the state of Idaho.
“The state of Idaho is going to – if they haven’t already – plunge wolves back towards extinction, at least in Idaho,” Carter said.
“How do you manage if you don’t know how many you have?” Carter added.
She isn’t alone in worrying about the state management of wolves and the removal of limits on hunting and trapping.
“Is it a violation of our treaty?” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler said. “Is it a violation of something that we were meant to protect? Of course it is. Of course it’s a violation of what was here in 1855 and before then. And that’s a part of tamáalwit, or the unwritten law, which we know that Article Three and the Treaty of 1855 with the Nez Perce represents.”
Some members of the wolf reintroduction teams say attitudes are even worse today than they were 30 years ago.
“Our country’s worse now than it was in terms of polarization, so those extreme divisions have only widened and become more cemented,” said Stone, executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project. “ Back then, if I had told anyone from the opposition that didn’t want to have wolves back that they would be trapping and killing wolves 365 days of the year, using bounties to kill even pups in the den, they would have told me I was crazy and that would never happen – never happen. And we’re living it today. That is the reality on the ground today.”

Stone isn’t alone.
“Oh, I’m pretty worried,” said Doug Smith, who headed up the wolf program at Yellowstone National Park for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Attitudes haven’t changed,” Smith said. “The fact is, they’re worse now. I’ve been studying wolves for over 40 years, and wolves have always been controversial. There’s always been people who like wolves and people who hate wolves. Now it’s like people are willing to do anything to get rid of wolves or anything to protect wolves, and they don’t want to talk to each other. I don’t think that’s progress, and right now the anti-wolf forces are winning in Idaho and Montana especially.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

The colors around the thermal features are locations of different thermophile communities. These thermophiles fix carbon, both from the atmosphere and from the hot water. (Jim Peaco/National Park Service)On the morning of June 21, visitors at Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park observed a bison slip into a shallow part of the hot spring. Clearly alarmed by the hot water — up to about 192 degrees Fahrenheit, which is just below boiling temperature at that elevation — the animal stumbled as it tried to get out and ended up stepping into an area of deeper water and quickly perished.
Yellowstone National Park officials decided not to remove the carcass. Such work would be dangerous and could cause extensive damage to the colorful bacterial mats that give Grand Prismatic Spring its name — that sort of damage can take more than a year to naturally repair itself. The bison’s body will break down quickly in the near-boiling water, and soon only the bones will be left.
Although rarely witnessed, it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. For example, an elk calf died while struggling to extract itself from mud pots in West Thumb Geyser Basin several years ago.
There are also animal skeletons visible in many hot springs, like Gentian Pool, Ojo Caliente, and the aptly named Skeleton Pool. Unexpectedly in 2022, University of California at Berkeley researchers found an elk skeleton in Doublet Pool, located on Geyser Hill near Old Faithful, when they put a camera into the spring as part of a study of hydrothermal activity. Similar incidents may have gone unwitnessed in the backcountry, or in winter or at night.
Animals can obviously feel the heat of thermal areas through their feet or hooves, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they never make mistakes near hydrothermal features. Most of these wildlife fatalities probably take place when animals break through thin crusts on the edges of springs.
The unfortunate incident of the bison at Grand Prismatic Spring provides an opportunity to revisit a common misconception about hot springs in Yellowstone, and also emphasize how to safely enjoy viewing the thermal features in the park.
Many visitors to Yellowstone believe that all of the hot springs in the park are acidic (pH lower than 5), and that the water will cause an acid burn on contact and dissolve any animals or people that fall into the springs. But nearly all major hot springs and geysers in Yellowstone are actually neutral (pH of around 7) or alkaline (pH greater than 7), including almost all of the geysers and hot springs in the famous thermal basins along the Firehole River.
Acidic features tend to be the fumaroles (gas vents), mud pots, and frying pans, which are all dominated by the release of acidic gases. One of the most acidic front-country features in the park is Sulphur Cauldron, in the Mud Volcano area. Fluids there have a pH less than 2, which is an acidity between that of stomach acid and lemon juice. Fortunately, acid concentrations are low, so mud and water from these features will not burn on contact, although it can cause skin irritation.
What kills most animals and occasionally people who fall into hot springs is not acidity, but temperature. Many hot springs are at or near boiling temperatures, and animal life will not survive for long when exposed, even if only briefly, to water that hot.
This is why staying on boardwalks in thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is a requirement and is so important for visitor safety. Many thermal areas have thin crusts at the surface that overlie boiling waters or even hotter steam. Many injuries and fatalities to people have happened off boardwalk, when people have broken through these crusts, stepped on an unsupported sinter ledge, or stumbled into springs that were obscured or not obvious.
Yellowstone is a wild and dynamic place and can be hazardous. Fortunately, humans (and most animals) can recognize and avoid those hazards. So be sure to enjoy Yellowstone’s magnificent thermal areas from the safety of trails and boardwalks, and don’t forget to stay a safe distance from wildlife wherever you may encounter the park’s charismatic megafauna.

(Courtesy of Sgt. Christopher Richardson)LINCOLN — A new state law that took effect this week authorizes emergency medical services crews to provide care or transportation to Nebraska K-9s if one is ever injured in the line of duty.
Lawmakers, by a 47-0 vote in April 2024, approved a measure from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston allowing emergency medical services for K-9s after July 1, 2025. It covers law enforcement canines owned or employed by state or local law enforcement, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, local fire departments or the State Fire Marshal’s Office.
K-9s aiding in the detection of criminal activity, flammable materials or missing persons; enforcement of laws; investigation of fires or apprehending criminal offenders would be covered.
Riepe said K-9s have proven beneficial and he hopes the law works out well.
“I think most people have a real kind spot in their heart for both dogs, cats, and probably some other animals that I’m not even aware of,” Riepe said this week.

Cody Thomas, a spokesperson for the Nebraska State Patrol, which employs and trains police service dogs, said the canines are “an extension of the officers they work with every day.” Such work can be dangerous for K-9s, with at least 10 killed in the line of duty nationwide already in 2025, he said.
“In the event one of our K-9 partners is injured in the line of duty, we would be grateful for any assistance provided by EMS teams, including transportation to an emergency veterinary hospital,” Thomas said in an email to the Nebraska Examiner.
At least two Nebraska K-9s have been killed in the past decade: K-9 Kobus for the Omaha Police Department in 2016 and K-9 Nitro II for the York County Sheriff’s Department in 2022.
More than a dozen states have similar laws.
Riepe’s legislation began at the initiative of Nebraska City Police Department Sgt. Christopher Richardson. Richardson sought to get around a state law forbidding any emergency care for an animal, including the bandaging of a minor cut.
“These dogs are alone and untreated, wasting valuable time and preventing lifesaving measures from being performed,” Richardson testified at a February 2024 hearing.
Richardson, who has taken multiple K-9s under his wing, told the Examiner in 2024 that in the case of Nebraska City, it can be a 45-minute delay to the nearest applicable care facility should his K-9 be harmed. He had said K-9 handlers spend more one-on-one time with their dogs, who he said can save an officer’s life without hesitation, than with their families.
“They’re not just another tool that’s on our duty belt,” Richardson previously told the Examiner.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The new law still gives humans priority in the need of medical care or transport. EMS teams, including volunteer departments, would not be required to implement the new law. Any EMS workers operating in “good faith” to care for the dogs would be given civil and criminal immunity.
“We just want to make sure we don’t leave a dog that was injured in duty behind, which seems like a very common-sense thing,” Riepe told the Examiner in 2024.
The law authorized the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to implement additional regulations. Instead, DHHS and the state’s Board of Emergency Medical Services and Board of Veterinary Medicine adopted multiple recommendations.
Among the recommendations for EMS teams that take on the new law:

Have a backup ambulance or plan to respond to emergency calls while caring for or transporting a K-9.
Certification in basic life support through the RECOVER initiative.
Specific training in K-9 care.
Close alignment with a local veterinary or pet care facility that would continue K-9 care after transport..
Medical equipment suitable for animal use, including oxygen masks and/or respiratory barrier masks for “mouth to snout” use.”
Written policies and procedures crafted with a local veterinarian for appropriate training, including safe handling for injured K-9s, such as muzzles, response coordination with a law enforcement officer trained in handling police dogs and decontamination procedures after K-9 transportation.

“We don’t want to have to transport our dogs in an ambulance,” Richardson said last year. “But if it comes to that, having that ability is huge.”

(contributed)Small communities in North Dakota can soon apply for grant money to support their grocery stores.
Lawmakers set aside $1 million for the grant during the 2025 legislative session out of concern for rural North Dakota towns that struggle to attract or sustain businesses that sell high-quality food. 
Successful applicants can receive up to $150,000.
The program is open to local governments — including tribal governments — with populations of 4,500 people or fewer.
Applicants must be able to match the grant money by 20%. Projects have to be completed within a year-and-a-half.
The Department of Commerce says it’s looking for proposals that show cooperation between “food providers, schools, restaurants and other local entities” to improve food access and support economic development in rural communities.
In testimony submitted in support of the grant earlier this year, North Dakota Grocers Association President John Dyste said food deserts are growing across the state.
“What rural grocers need is access to funding that will allow them to upgrade their facilities and equipment,” Dyste said. “They also need reliable, affordable access to groceries and perishable products.”
He added that people looking to buy independent rural grocery stores often have trouble securing financing.
The program follows a pilot rural food sustainability grant established during the 2023 legislative session.
The application window for the rural grocery store grant opens at 3 p.m. Wednesday and closes Sept. 3 at 5 p.m. For more information, visit the link program’s webpage.
A separate Department of Commerce grant puts a total $15 million up for grabs to support North Dakota tourism. 
The idea is to support projects that will draw out-of-state visitors to North Dakota recreational locations that reflect the state’s “culture, identity or landscape.”
Individual awards can range from $25,000 to $5 million. The grant is for projects that are shovel-ready, according to the Department of Commerce. Matching funds are also required.
Previous recipients of Department of Commerce tourism grants include: 

Shores Event Center in Devils Lake
Thrill Hills, a ski hill in Fort Ransom
Indian Hills Resort, a hunting and fishing resort in Garrison

The Legislature approved the grant during the 2025 legislative session to support the state’s tourism industry.
Applications opened earlier this week and will close July 31 at 5 p.m.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With burgers sizzling and classic rock thumping, many Americans revel in summer cookouts — at least until that wayward cousin asks for a “pop” in soda country, or even worse, a “coke” when they actually want a Sprite.
Few American linguistic debates have bubbled quite as long and effervescently as the one over whether a generic soft drink should be called a soda, pop or coke.
The word you use generally boils down to where you’re from: Midwesterners enjoy a good pop, while soda is tops in the North and far West. Southerners, long the cultural mavericks, don’t bat an eyelash asking for coke — lowercase — before homing in on exactly the type they want: Perhaps a root beer or a Coke, uppercase.
As a linguist who studies American dialects, I’m less interested in this regional divide and far more fascinated by the unexpected history behind how a fizzy “health” drink from the early 1800s spawned the modern soft drink’s many names and iterations.
 
Bubbles, anyone?
Foods and drinks with wellness benefits might seem like a modern phenomenon, but the urge to create drinks with medicinal properties inspired what might be called a soda revolution in the 1800s.
The process of carbonating water was first discovered in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, this carbonated water had become popular as a health drink and was often referred to as “soda water.” The word “soda” likely came from “sodium,” since these drinks often contained salts, which were then believed to have healing properties.
Given its alleged curative effects for health issues such as indigestion, pharmacists sold soda water at soda fountains, innovative devices that created carbonated water to be sold by the glass. A chemistry professor, Benjamin Stillman, set up the first such device in a drugstore in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1806. Its eventual success inspired a boom of soda fountains in drugstores and health spas.
By the mid-1800s, pharmacists were creating unique root-, fruit- and herb-infused concoctions, such as sassafras-based root beer, at their soda fountains, often marketing them as cures for everything from fatigue to foul moods.
These flavored, sweetened versions gave rise to the linking of the word “soda” with a sweetened carbonated beverage, as opposed to simple, carbonated water.
Seltzer — today’s popular term for such sparkling water — was around, too. But it was used only for the naturally carbonated mineral water from the German town Nieder-Selters. Unlike Perrier, sourced similarly from a specific spring in France, seltzer made the leap to becoming a generic term for fizzy water.
 
Regional naming patterns
So how did “soda” come to be called so many different things in different places?
It all stems from a mix of economic enterprise and linguistic ingenuity.
The popularity of “soda” in the Northeast likely reflects the soda fountain’s longer history in the region. Since a lot of Americans living in the Northeast migrated to California in the mid-to-late 1800s, the name likely traveled west with them.
As for the Midwestern preference for “pop” — well, the earliest American use of the term to refer to a sparkling beverage appeared in the 1840s in the name of a flavored version called “ginger pop.” Such ginger-flavored pop, though, was around in Britain by 1816, since a Newcastle songbook is where you can first see it used in text. The “pop” seems to be onomatopoeic for the noise made when the cork was released from the bottle before drinking.
Linguists don’t fully know why “pop” became so popular in the Midwest. But one theory links it to a Michigan bottling company, Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works — today known as Faygo Beverages — that used “pop” in the name of the sodas they marketed and sold. Another theory suggests that because bottles were more common in the region, soda drinkers were more likely to hear the “pop” sound than in the Northeast, where soda fountains reigned.
As for using coke generically, the first Coca-Cola was served in 1886 by Dr. John Pemberton, a pharmacist at Jacobs’ Pharmacy in Atlanta and the founder of the company. In the 1900s, the Coca-Cola company tried to stamp out the use of “Coke” for “Coca-Cola.” But that ship had already sailed. Since Coca-Cola originated and was overwhelmingly popular in the South, its generic use grew out of the fact that people almost always asked for “Coke.”

As with Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aids and seltzer, it became a generic term.
 
What’s soft about it?
Speaking of soft drinks, what’s up with that term?
It was originally used to distinguish all nonalcoholic drinks from “hard drinks,” or beverages containing spirits.
Interestingly, the original Coca-Cola formula included wine — resembling a type of alcoholic “health” drink popular overseas, Vin Mariani. But Pemberton went on to develop a “soft” version a few years later to be sold as a medicinal drink.
Due to the growing popularity of soda water concoctions, eventually “soft drink” came to mean only such sweetened carbonated beverages, a linguistic testament to America’s enduring love affair with sugar and bubbles.
With the average American guzzling almost 40 gallons per year, you can call it whatever you what. Just don’t call it healthy.

(Washington State Parks)Though Washington State Parks, like other parts of state government, did not make it through this year’s legislative session with its budget unscathed, park visitors shouldn’t notice any staffing or service changes this summer, according to the agency.
“We were fairly fortunate in that we were able to make mostly non-staffing cuts to be able to stay within budget,” said Sarah Fronk, a State Parks spokesperson.
New budget, some new state laws take effect today in Idaho

The agency’s operating budget for the 2025-27 biennium is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for the 2023-25 biennium.
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget.
“It’s really being extremely mindful of where we’re spending and what our priorities are,” Fronk said of managing the cuts, adding that maintaining safe and clean parks is the agency’s primary focus.
In addition to a smaller budget, State Parks is now expected to fund 71% of its costs with revenue from Discover Passes and other fees, up from 65% in the last budget cycle.
Discover Pass prices will rise from $30 to $45 on Oct. 1. Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites.
The Legislature approved the Discover Pass price increase during last year’s session. It’s the first price increase since the passes were introduced about 14 years ago.
“We’re really grateful to the Legislature for having our backs and kicking a little more revenue support our way,” Fronk said. “With the Discover Pass, I really can’t reiterate enough that it really does go to support your state parks and the stewardship and recreation work that we’re doing, because so much of our agency’s revenue is dependent on those sales.”
Washington State Parks manages about 123 developed parks, 6,000 campsites, 800 historic buildings and 1,300 miles of trails across 12,000 acres of land.
State Parks’ busy summer season runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in September.
“We’re anticipating that there’ll be a lot of visitors to state parks this year, and so we’re definitely gearing up for that,” Fronk said.
In an effort to support staff with a smaller budget, State Parks is bolstering its education programs “so that people coming into the park don’t need quite as much help, and we can stay focused on cleaning and doing interpretive work,” Fronk said.
New this summer, State Parks has partnered with the Washington State Parks Foundation and the online education platform Fridie Outdoors to create an educational video series for park visitors.
State Parks also has a variety of outdoor guides and other resources available on its website to help visitors build outdoor literacy.
“I really believe that, once people get those experiences outdoors and understand more what they’re seeing around them, they’re going to be more excited and interested in helping protect that, as well,” Fronk said.

Military aircraft including a B-2 bomber flew over the White House as the national anthem was sung.Trump saluted 150 airmen and their families at the event from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where the B-2s that bombed Iran in June originated their flights.But he also attacked Democrats who opposed his legislation, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who gave a speech on the floor in opposition on Wednesday that broke a House record for its length.Members of the Cabinet were present for the bill-signing as well as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Crapo of Idaho and other top GOP members of Congress.The president signed the bill seated at a desk in front of the picnic-goers, with lawmakers and Cabinet members surrounding him. Johnson presented Trump with the gavel that Johnson said he used when the vote closed to pass the “big, beautiful bill.” Trump pounded on the desk with the gavel and handed out pens to those gathered around him.Medicaid slashedIn order to fulfill priorities in the tax and spending cut bill, congressional Republicans scaled back spending on Medicaid, food assistance for low-income people and clean energy programs.Democrats objected to the cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and other provisions. But because Republicans have unified control of Congress, the GOP was able to pass the bill through a complex process known as reconciliation, skirting the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.The Senate passed its version of the bill after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking 51-50 vote Tuesday. The House managed Thursday to pass the new version of the bill after two chaotic days negotiating with far-right members who initially objected to the bill and later acquiesced, with a vote of 218-214.The only Republicans to object in the Senate were Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis. The House GOP members who voted with Democrats were Kentucky’s Thomas Massie and Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick.Also tucked into the bill is a provision that raises the country’s debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which has brought objections from Republican fiscal hawks like Paul.",,,,2025-07-04 19:03:46.736062

(Courtesy of Ned Pillersdorf)Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf is hoping to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers next year. 
Pillersdorf was scheduled to formally announce his candidacy at the Rosenberg Square in the Floyd County seat Friday afternoon, but he spoke with the Kentucky Lantern earlier this week about his plans. Pillersdorf, a Democrat, said his decision to run stems mostly from Rogers’ support for the sweeping GOP megabill that includes cuts to social safety net programs on which many people in the district depend.
Rogers, of Somerset, has represented Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District for nearly 45 years. The region includes much of Appalachian Kentucky. 
The congressional district is also one of the nation’s poorest and one of the most dependent on Medicaid. Almost half of the constituents in the district — 44% — rely on the state-federal program to pay for their health care and it has been critical to sustaining hospital services in Eastern Kentucky.
Pillersdorf — whose law office proclaims, “We represent underdogs” — is known as the attorney who stepped up to represent thousands of Eastern Kentuckians who lost disability benefits after being represented by disgraced attorney Eric Conn.
Conn was convicted of defrauding the Social Security Administration and sentenced to prison. Pillersdorf is featured prominently in the 2022 Apple TV+ documentary series, “The Big Conn,” which recaps the case and Conn’s capture after he fled to Honduras. 
Pillersdorf also is no stranger to politics, as he helped run nonpartisan campaigns for his wife, former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Janet Stumbo. She became the first woman elected to the state’s high court in 1993.

However, Pillersdorf says this campaign is “not so much about me” but “what’s on the horizon” for people who will lose safety net resources under the GOP bill. 
Pillersdorf said Rogers’ backing of the legislation is “a betrayal of the needs of our citizens,” as the legislation “will cause incalculable damage to this region.” As the legislation moved through Congress, Pillersdorf said he decided to combine his campaign announcement with a protest against the safety net cuts. 
“I just think that that bill will have tremendous impacts across the board, and Hal Rogers truly betrayed the needs to protect the safety net,” Pillersdorf said. 
The Democratic candidate also has concerns about other clawbacks of federal funding for local programs under the Trump administration, such as a shutdown of Job Corps programs and education funding that is now up in the air. Within the congressional district, Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining $3 million in pandemic relief funding to replace 25 school buses lost during 2022 floods, but Trump’s U.S. Department of Education nixed the reimbursement. The Trump administration also canceled a grant to the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County that was to support reading and math intervention programs.
“There is just a systemwide attack on the safety net on multiple fronts, and my criticism of the Democratic Party is we don’t pay attention to rural voters, and we are a rural district, and we are under attack,” Pillersdorf said. “And I intended to be an independent Democratic voice for our rural community to fight back about what’s going on on multiple fronts.” 
Pillersdorf acknowledged that the Democratic Party’s reputation in rural America right now is “problematic.” Kentucky Democrats have faced a recent setback in Eastern Kentucky after longtime state Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, joined the Republican Party. However, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told Kentucky Democrats during a June dinner that he is focused on getting “the DNC out of D.C.” in hopes of bringing rural voters back into the fold. 
The political landscape “is radically changing” as voters hear more about the GOP megabill, Pillersdorf said. He added that he believes the legislation “has reshuffled the deck” for Democrats.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ned-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-07-04 17:05:17.539217

Jazon Gonzalez Perez, granted a $2,500 bond by a judge Wednesday in immigration court, was spotlighted in a recent Nebraska Examiner story. His friend and mentor, lifelong Nebraskan Richard Randall, Sr., described how his own support and view of President Donald Trump’s immigration strategy had shifted. 
Randall said the arrest of his “little buddy,” Gonzalez Perez, “hit home” and did not represent the type of enforcement he had bought into when he voted for Trump last November. The case reflected stepped-up tactics at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration.
When arrested, Gonzalez Perez had been looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work. A cellphone search led him toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base. He was detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.

Base personnel called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Gonzalez Perez called Randall. 
As agents took Gonzalez Perez, Randall recalled saying, “Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. He’s none of those.”
Gonzalez Perez’s attorney, Erika Buenrostro, said her client was released on bond pending resolution of his civil case in immigration court. He is accused of unauthorized U.S. presence. Given the court backlog, local attorneys say such cases can take years to resolve.
Upon his release from nearly a month in jail, Randall said his buddy expressed gratitude for Plattsmouth area community members who showed support, and that Gonzalez Perez was happy to be home with family and friends.
“Our community spoke up for Jazon and he is touched by all of the support,” said Randall.

John C. Hughes is, at root, a storyteller. As he marks the end of a nearly six-decade career that spanned hot-type newspapering on the coast to crafting the biographical record of Washington’s political and civic leaders, he recognizes a shift in his own disposition. Once sanguine about civic life, even with all its faults, he finds himself in a funk at this time of transition — morose, melancholy, and discouraged.
As he prepares to retire, Hughes leaves behind a shelf full of books, countless oral histories, and a warning: The decline of journalism and civic memory threatens democracy itself.
His body of work began in his hometown, where he still lives. “Grays Harbor is one of those places that has terroir, a sense of place,” Hughes said, explaining his lifelong connection to the timber town of Aberdeen, where he spent 42 years at The Daily World, eventually rising to editor and publisher. He turned down jobs at larger newspapers, including offers from The Seattle Times, out of a commitment to community journalism. “There was something in my blood,” he said. “It’s where I think I belong.”
In a wide-ranging and often poignant conversation with Austin Jenkins on TVW’s Inside Olympia, Hughes said his career began as a reporter in the mid-1960s. Washington had dozens of small daily newspapers with vibrant newsrooms. The Daily World boasted a staff of 21 reporters at its peak. Today, Hughes noted, the paper employs just three journalists and its circulation has plummeted below 5,000. “We had three great photographers on staff, we did investigative work, we went toe to toe with the big-city papers,” he recalled.
The loss, he said, is not just in jobs or prestige. It’s civic. “There’s a direct line between the decline of newspapers and the decline of civic engagement,” Hughes said. “When people don’t know their own stories, they don’t know how to defend their communities.”
As chief historian for Legacy Washington, a project of the secretary of state’s office, Hughes transitioned from reporting the present to preserving the past. In that role, he conducted hundreds of interviews and authored or co-authored 17 books over 17 years, telling the stories of governors, judges, lawmakers, civil rights pioneers, and cultural figures, all of whom left an indelible mark on the state. His subjects include Gov. John Spellman, Sen. Slade Gorton, columnist Adele Ferguson, and former first lady Nancy Evans.
When asked which of his books he considers most consequential, Hughes pointed to “John Spellman: Politics Never Broke His Heart,” praising Spellman as a one-term Republican governor who vetoed a massive pipeline project out of environmental concern. “The Inimitable Adele Ferguson” stands out for its portrait of the legendary Bremerton political columnist who held Olympia’s feet to the fire. And “Slade Gorton: A Half Century in Politics” documents the arc of a brilliant, if polarizing, legal and political career.
His most recent book, “New Land,” co-authored with historian Ed Echtle, tells the story of Washington’s resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees after the Vietnam War. Hughes credits former Gov. Dan Evans, former Secretary of State Bruce Chapman and then special emissary to the governor Ralph Munro as exemplars of what he calls “latter-day profiles in courage.”
“These are stories that animate us toward citizenship,” he said. “They’re about people who did the right thing when it wasn’t easy.”
Despite working for a statewide elected official, Hughes has maintained a fierce sense of professional independence. “I am in no way a spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of State,” he said. “There hasn’t been a partisan litmus test, not once.”
His ability to write 17 books in 17 years? That, he said, comes from the rigors of daily journalism. “When you become an accomplished journeyman deadline reporter, then you can write quickly,” he said. “I just love storytelling.”
That storytelling instinct was reinforced early by Murray Morgan, the renowned historian and author of “Skid Road,” who once advised Hughes to “be a newspaperman first” to sharpen his writing and his instincts.
But along with the pride in his work comes melancholy. Hughes has written about many people who are now gone — including Gorton, Spellman and Ferguson. “My mom always said the best thing about people who were so alive when they were alive is that when they’re gone, it’s like they’re really still here,” he said. “But you still miss them.”
That sense of loss extends to institutions. Hughes mourned the state’s decision to shutter the Washington State Library and the Talking Book & Braille Library due to budget cuts. “I can’t think of anything more gratuitously stupid than to close a great cultural institution like the Washington State Library,” he said.
Looking back on his hometown, Hughes has also witnessed political realignment. Grays Harbor, once a Democratic stronghold, has voted for Donald Trump in three consecutive elections. Hughes was not surprised. “The grievance on Grays Harbor is that the Democratic Party has, in essence, said, ‘Let them eat cake.’”
He spoke of the disappearance of “lunch-bucket Democrats” — moderate, labor-aligned lawmakers like Sid Snyder, Jim Hargrove and Brian Blake. “A breed of Democrat that’s pretty much extinct at this point. Maybe [they’ve] gone the way of the spotted owl.”
Ultimately, Hughes worries about the future of democracy. “I believe these are perilous times for American democracy,” he said. “If we don’t understand our history — if we don’t teach civics and truth—then we lose the shared values that hold us together.”
After a career that spanned both headlines and history books, Hughes summed it up simply: “I count every day as a real blessing. And I get to tell these stories.” Affirming Morgan’s famous formulation, Hughes says, “Journalism is the sport of kings.”

He visited Stewpot Community Services during its daily free lunch hour Thursday to discuss new state laws, which took effect two days earlier, targeting Mississippians experiencing homelessness.
“I understand that you are going through some hard times right now. That’s why I’m here,” Wade said to the crowd. “I felt it was important to come out here and speak with you directly.”
Wade laid out the three bills that passed earlier this year: House Bill 1197, the “Safe Solicitation Act,” HB 1200, the “Real Property Owners Protection Act” and HB 1203, a bill that prohibits camping on public property. 
“Sleeping and laying in public places, you’re not going to be able to do that anymore,” he said. “There’s a law that has been passed that you can’t just set up encampments on public or private properties where it’s a public nuisance, it’s a problem.”
The “Real Property Owners Protection Act,” authored by Rep. Brent Powell, R-Brandon, is a bill that expedites the process of removing squatters. The “Safe Solicitation Act,” authored by Rep. Shanda Yates, I-Jackson, requires a permit for panhandling and allows people to be charged with a misdemeanor if they violate this law. The offense is punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 and an offender could face up to six months in jail. Wade said he’s currently working with his legal department to determine the best strategy for creating and issuing permits. 
“We’re going to navigate these legal challenges, get some interpretations, not only from our legal department, but the Attorney General’s office to ensure that we are doing it legally and lawfully, because I understand that these are citizens,” he said. “I understand that they deserve to be treated with respect, and I understand that we are going to do this without violating their constitutional rights.”

Wade said the Jackson Police Department is steadily fielding reports of squatters in abandoned properties and the law change gives officers new power to remove them more quickly. The added challenge? Figuring out what to do with a person’s belongings. 
“These people are carrying around what they own, but we are not a repository for all of their stuff,” he said. “So, when we make that arrest, we’ve got to have a strategic plan as to what we do with their stuff.” 
Wade said there needs to be a deeper conversation around the issues that lead someone to becoming homeless. 
“A lot of people that we’re running across that are homeless are also suffering from medical conditions, mental health issues, and they’re also suffering from drug addiction and substance abuse. We’ve got to have a strategic approach, but we also can’t log jam our jail down in Raymond,” Wade said. 
He estimates that more than 800 people are currently incarcerated at the Raymond Detention Center, and any increase could strain the system as the laws continue to be enforced.
“I think there’s layers that we have to work through, there’s hurdles that we are going to overcome, but we’ve got to make sure that we do it and make sure that my team and JPD is consistent in how we enforce these laws,” Wade said.
Diners applauded Wade after he spoke, in between bites of fried chicken, salad, corn and 4th of July-themed packaged cakes. Wade offered to answer questions, but no one asked any.
Rev. Jill Buckley, executive director of Stewpot, said that the legislation is a good tool to address issues around homelessness and community needs. She doesn’t want to see people who are homeless be criminalized, but she also wants communities to be safe.
“I support people’s right to self determine, and we can’t impose our choices on other people, but there are some cases in which that impinges on community safety, and so to the extent that anyone who is camping or panhandling or squatting and is a danger to themselves and others, of course, I fully support that kind of law. I don’t support homelessness being criminalized as such,” Buckley said.

Many of the people Wade addressed while they ate Thursday said they have housing, don’t panhandle, and shouldn’t be directly impacted by the legislation. But Marcus Willis, 42, said it would make more sense if elected officials wanted to combat the negative impacts of homelessness that they help more people secure employment.
“There ain’t enough jobs,” said Willis, who was having lunch with his girlfriend Amber Ivy.
The two live in an apartment together nearby on Capitol Street, where Ivy landed after her mother, whom Ivy had been living with, suffered a stroke and lost the property. Similarly, Willis started coming to eat at Stewpot after his grandmother, whose house he used to visit for lunch, passed away.
Willis holds odd jobs – cutting grass, home and auto repair – so the income is inconsistent, and every opportunity for stable employment he said he’s found is outside of Jackson in the suburbs. The couple doesn’t have a car.
Making rent every month usually depends on their ability to find someone to help chip in, said Ivy, who is in recovery from substance abuse. She said she’s watched problems surrounding homelessness grow over the years in Jackson. Ivy grew up near Stewpot and has lived in various neighborhoods across the city – except for the times she moved out of state when things got too rough.
“There was just moments where I just had to leave,” Ivy said. “Sometimes if you hit a slump here, there’s almost no way for you to get out of it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03143348/Chief-Wade-at-Stewpot-4.jpg,,,2025-07-04 14:09:32.645224

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s entry into the 2026 race for South Dakota governor launches him into a Republican primary in which a competitor is making allegiance to President Donald Trump a main issue.
Johnson announced his candidacy Monday with a pledge to focus on “addition and multiplication” rather than division and anger. That same day, a political action committee issued a statement accusing Johnson of being insufficiently loyal to Trump.
“Dusty Johnson is South Dakota’s Never-Trumper-In-Chief,” said Drew Dennert, chairman of Dakota First Action.

The group was founded by Toby Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman who announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor in May. On Tuesday, some South Dakotans received a large postcard from Doeden’s campaign featuring a photo of a bloody Trump after an assassination attempt, with the headine “Will you answer President Trump’s call?”
The other declared Republican candidate for governor is the speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, who announced in April. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden — who is serving the remainder of Kristi Noem’s term after she resigned for a post in the Trump administration — has not announced whether he’s running.
Johnson said accusations that he’s not supportive of Trump “are not criticisms I generally hear these days.”
“We’re in a political environment where people love to level accusations. And the reality is, I kind of reject the labels,” Johnson said. “I’m just a conservative who’s trying to get things done. And clearly, that means working with President Trump, and we’ve got a great working relationship. He’s had me down in Mar-a-Lago. He’s had me at the Super Bowl. We talk regularly about policy.” 
Johnson, 48, is a married father of three from Mitchell who is currently serving his fourth term as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The following conversation with Johnson has been edited for length and clarity.
Why do you want to be South Dakota’s governor instead of its congressman? 
I love the state. I think the next 20 years for South Dakota could be the best in our history, but I don’t think that’s a sure thing. I think to realize that future, we need a real plan. I think we need real leadership, and I’m excited to be the person who pulls together that plan and pulls together that team. 
In many respects, I think the challenges facing South Dakota right now are the right fit for my skill set. 
Some Republicans claim you are not a “real” conservative. How will you address that? 
The proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, the Republican voters get a say. The Republican voters like the job I do, they understand the conservative and pragmatic worldview that I bring to my work, and they like it. 
You voted to certify the 2020 election and voted against Trump’s border wall emergency declaration during his first term. How will you address accusations that you don’t support the president?
Those are not criticisms I generally hear these days. I mean, I think if you were to ask Chat GPT to gather up all of the political articles of the last two years, I think one narrative would be that Dusty Johnson is just too close to Donald Trump. 
I don’t try to be any particular type of Republican. I just try to be a conservative who gets things done. 
The whole label conversation is kind of ridiculous. It maybe tells you what a dysfunctional age we’re in that I can be an architect of some of the major successes of the House in the last seven months — securing the border, cutting spending and reforming welfare — and somehow, for some people, that’s not enough.
Trump’s cuts to the federal government have resulted in South Dakota’s state government losing $24 million thus far, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management. You’ve been generally supportive of those cuts. How would you address that lost funding as governor?
Anytime the federal government cuts anything, there is a narrative that the sky is falling. And clearly, some of these cuts are uncomfortable, and I don’t want to be cavalier about them. I mean, these are real programs that matter. And yet, $24 million out of a $7 billion state budget is about one-third of 1% of the state budget. 
South Dakotans are resilient enough. We’re resourceful enough to be able to tighten our belt and still get the important things done, even in the face of a federal government that absolutely must move toward fiscal responsibility. 
I’m proud of those fiscally responsible votes that I’ve taken. I know they’re not always easy, but if we don’t take care of business, our country will go bankrupt.

What areas of state government would you first look at when considering cuts?
Number one, we do need to cut property taxes. And unlike some, I think we need to do it in a responsible way that protects those core services and roads, bridges, cops and schools. 
Number two, we need to make college and technical school more affordable. And we need to double down on the programs and the research that really moves South Dakota forward. 
In K-12, we need to be relentless about student achievement. We are not talking enough about student achievement. We need to set real goals, we need to use real data. We can’t be afraid to lead. 
We need to focus more on drugs and addiction if we want safer communities. We need new interdiction teams, and we need smarter training and treatment within the walls of our prisons. 
And we need to grow this economy so we can keep taxes low. That’s going to come from new small businesses, new energy production, dairy expansion and bringing high-tech jobs home to South Dakota. 
How would you go about cutting property taxes? 
I think we need to focus our property tax relief on the owner-occupied residential, and really, the farmer-managed ag property. 
We have plenty of out-of-staters who own plenty of property in South Dakota, and I’m just not as interested in giving them a tax break. 
Several failed bills last legislative session in Pierre aimed to create some form of school vouchers using public funds to support non-public educational options. Would you support legislation to establish a voucher program?
I’m a big supporter of educational choice and properly funding our public schools. 
I’ve got three sons who are products of public schools, and our Mitchell schools have done an incredible job with my boys. 
We’re very involved parents. We spend a lot of time focusing on what they’re learning. And I think the quality of the education is excellent. And I think, as long as we are properly funding our public school systems, then I think we’re allowed the flexibility to ask if there are other educational opportunities that we can invest in as well.
Last legislative session, lawmakers passed and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill banning eminent domain — a legal process for obtaining land access — for carbon dioxide pipelines. As governor, how would you have navigated that?
It’s not my interest in re-litigating every decision that the last administration has done. Fundamentally, this has got to be a forward-looking campaign. And so I just don’t know that there’s any benefit in me being critical of anything that Governor Rhoden has done. 
South Dakota has long struggled with workforce shortages in health care and child care. How would you address these chronic issues? 
First off, let’s put this into context: This is not a South Dakota problem. It’s a problem in South Dakota, but it’s a problem everywhere. Literally, every one of the 50 states has chronic and severe workforce shortages in child care and health care. 
So, I think we need to be honest with ourselves that this is going to take a multi-year, focused effort to solve. This is, in part, closing the skills gap. I think we need to identify people who can go into those fields and do a better job of getting them the education they need. 
There is no silver bullet. It will be 100 solutions that address this problem, not one big one. 
President Trump has deployed military forces on U.S. soil during protests without state consent, attempted to redefine birthright citizenship by executive order, fired independent inspectors general, deported people allegedly without due process, threatened to annex Canada and Greenland, and intimidated dissenting media. What do you say to protesters in South Dakota worried that America is moving toward authoritarianism?
We have to care about the rule of law. And so, what does the rule of law mean? That means that you only get to do those things that are lawful exercises of power. 
Here’s what we know: The federal judiciary has said that the way the president handled the birthright citizenship case is permissible for now; they have said that his use of the National Guard is permissible for now; the firing of independent inspectors general was also permissible.
And so, it’s an interesting allegation for people to say that the president is being an authoritarian when he is following court orders. He has won in these court cases. 
I feel like it would be inappropriate for him to ignore a federal court order, but he hasn’t. He’s been winning these things, so it’s an odd accusation for them to make that he’s the one who is violating the rule of law.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2550-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 13:14:23.133911

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will be $70.92 this year, 30 cents less than last summer but the second-highest cookout cost since 2013 when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops saw the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Cans of pork and beans had the steepest increase, up 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 it cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in that time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.

The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, the U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the South — which includes Maryland, in the Farm Bureau report — where a party of 10 can be fed for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher earnings for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about 16 cents per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from the Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done — work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

Wes Moore said the state will find a new location for its planned $7 million cannabis incubator project, after local opposition to the original choice at the Maryland National Guard’s William J. Witte Armory in Catonsville.
In a statement Wednesday, Moore said that after further review of the project, he decided that the state “should explore new options” for the incubator’s location. The three agencies leading the project — the Maryland Cannabis Administration, the Department of General Services and the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO) — will immediately begin a new search process to find potential sites.
“As part of their site review, I have instructed the agencies to identify locations that are not within close proximity to residential communities and schools,” Moore wrote. “The agencies will begin this new process immediately, conduct extensive community and stakeholder engagement, and work quickly to move the project forward.”
The announcement comes after the incubator’s planned location drew opposition in recent weeks from some local residents because the site is in a residential area and close to a nearby elementary school, a temple and a day care center.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Catonsville resident Josh Jackson launched a Change.org petition in early June opposing the project and calling for greater transparency from the state throughout the process. The petition notes potential problems of having the incubator in the community, including security concerns from the site’s cannabis storage, nuisance smells and traffic issues.
“Whether or not you support cannabis rights, creating a cannabis incubator, or spending up to $7 million on such a project, the community where this business is to be located should have been informed and should have had their input considered,” the petition read. “There are plenty of other opportunities in the State to create a safe and secure space for business growth in existing commercial or industrial areas after clear communication and public input.”
In a December 2023 report, MEDCO listed 37 locations across the state which were submitted for consideration and reviewed as potential sites for the incubator. Notably, the armory was not included on that list of potential locations.
The project aims to be the country’s first-ever state-owned cannabis incubator. Up to 110 microbusinesses would be able to use the incubator to securely store their product before delivery or to process cannabis products using the building’s shared commercial kitchen and equipment, according to written

His statements from that time may inform the present moment.
Sherman was a key figure in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution, and the amendments that came to be known as the Bill of Rights. He also revised the Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut in 1784, including an Abstract and Declaration of the Rights and Privileges of the People of this State, asserting that Connecticut “shall forever be and remain a free, sovereign and independent State … under the sole authority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince whatever.”


Also in 1784, Roger wrote in defense of the Articles of Confederation, “The Honorable Continental Congress have taken due care to secure the rights of the separate states,” and “Each state retains its SOVEREIGNTY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE, and every power, jurisdiction and right, not expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.”
In the Connecticut Courant in 1788, Sherman wrote, “The immediate security of the civil and domestic rights of the people will be in the governments of the particular states. And as the different states have different local interests and customs which can best be regulated by their own laws, it would not be expedient to admit the federal government to interfere with them any further than necessary for the good of the whole.”
Sherman was also concerned about executive power. He believed that the President of the United States should be “nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect,” and he “was against enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole,” as the legislature “was the depository of the supreme will of the Society.”
Despite these early warnings, our history has found it expedient to admit federal interference in the states and to relinquish powers to the President. Now that interference, and the abdication of power by the legislature, threaten the security of the civil and domestic rights of the people in Connecticut. The current federal administration is testing the limits of executive authority with orders that violate the most basic individual rights despite Connecticut’s own strong guarantees to equal protection and due process.
Concerns about the erosion of civil-rights protections by devolution under a new federalism assume that federal protections are stronger than the protections offered by the state. This moment in Connecticut turns that argument on its head. Though the Fourteenth Amendment enabled the United States to impose civil rights to emancipation, equal protection, public education, and accommodations for disabilities, among others, the same “power to enforce” now brings regressive and repressive federal actions.
Under a new progressive federalism, Connecticut can be a safe haven of civil rights for our residents. If there are any federal protections that exceed those assured by our state laws and Constitution, then we can ask our General Assembly and our governor to enact those protections here.

(USDA photo courtesy of Humane World for Animals) An Iowa-based animal welfare organization has conducted what may be the first nationwide study of regulatory violations among dog breeders who supply brokers and retailers with animals.
The study shows that more than half of the breeders or brokers who supply retail stores with puppies, and who have been tracked over the past three years by the nonprofit organization Bailing Out Benji,  have been cited for regulatory violations.
Mindi Callison, executive director of the Iowa-based nonprofit organization, says that for decades, there has been a lack of data surrounding the pet-acquisition industry — particularly with regard to the complicated intersection of breeders, brokers and sellers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
To address that issue, Callison says, Bailing Out Benji has widened its scope of research from federally licensed breeders who sell to pet shops to include state-licensed breeders and dealers as well as online sellers and the brokers who act as “middle men” in the trafficking of animals.
The research, she says, paints a fuller picture of the issues that the commercial dog-breeding world faces, and is the first of its kind. It’s based on an analysis of five years of data on the thousands of breeders who are licensed at the federal and state level, plus three years of data on the breeders who supply pet stores.
“For the first time ever, the commercial dog breeding and sales industry has been audited,” she said. “These facts and figures will allow for us to track progress on the national level, while giving us a more clear picture on where the problem areas are so they can be addressed.”

She said the first step toward meaningful change is having a clear understanding of the scope of the problem. “This data will be a game changer for those who are passionate about using real facts to drive that change for animals and the people who love them,” she said, adding that the data will help her and others track progress when advocates and lawmakers are trying to pass legislation related to animal welfare.
The data, Callison said, provides national averages for regulatory violations among licensed breeders, the breeders and brokers who supply pet stores, the breeders who supply third-party brokers, and the breeders and brokers who sell through online websites.
She said that in Iowa, specifically, about 33% of the brokers and breeders licensed at the state and federal level have been cited for regulatory violations at some point in the past five years.

“That is slightly lower than what we are seeing as the national average and is based on 678 facilities we are tracking in Iowa — which includes breeders who recently canceled their licenses after they had violations,” she said. “On the pet-store side, we are seeing that 28% percent of the breeders in Iowa that have sold to pet stores in the last three years have had violations.”
Among the study’s national findings:
— Violations by breeders: 41% of the licensed breeders have incurred state or federal violations during the past five years.
— Breeders to stores: 36% of the 1,946 licensed breeders who directly supplied pet stores in the last three years have incurred state or federal violations.
— Breeders to brokers: 34% of the breeders found to be supplying brokers in the last three years had incurred state or federal violations. Callison notes that this finding is based on preliminary data that may be updated since it does not reflect every breeder who sells through brokers.
— Puppy stores: 63% of the 542 puppy stores that have been tracked over the last three years have purchased puppies from breeders or brokers with known regulatory violations. This data excludes stores with common, shared ownership and which don’t receive shipments directly from the breeders or brokers.
— Online sales: 42% of the licensed breeders known to be supplying online brokering websites or online marketplaces have incurred state or federal violations. This data doesn’t capture every breeder who sells through an online broker, with Callison noting that some breeders who sell through such websites are unlicensed.
With regard to the online brokers and the unlicensed breeders who supply them, Callison said Bailing Out Benji is currently tracking thousands of unlicensed breeders and is in the process of auditing more than 20,000 online sellers who traffic animals through three brokering websites.
Once Bailing Out Benji has more conclusive data to share on that universe of sales, she said, the organization will update its reporting.

According to the Iowa Board of Mental Health Professionals, Abigail Doerder, 43, who practiced social work in Nevada and currently lives in Boone, is charged with negligence in the practice of the profession, unethical conduct, and violating the terms of an agreement or contract with the Impaired Practitioner Review Committee.
As is usually the case when charges are filed by Iowa’s licensing boards, the Board of Mental Health Professionals has not publicly disclosed the nature of the alleged conduct, or when it may have occurred.
It’s not clear what impact the charges might have on Doerder’s licensing status since, according to the board, her license expired in December 2024.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9, 2025. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Doerder for comment.
Court records show that in 2022, Doerder was arrested and charged with driving while barred as a habitual offender. Boone County prosecutors later amended the charge to the misdemeanor offense of improper taillights and Doerder was fined $30.
That case followed a 2018 incident in which Doerder was arrested in the parking lot of the Boone County Hospital and charged with third-offense drunken driving.

(Photo provided by Bullets and Bandaids)Since publishing its first volume more than a decade ago, Bullets and Bandaids has worked with more than 100 veterans, mostly from South Carolina, giving them a platform to share their experiences through written stories and art.
And in the last two years, the organization has reached some 60,000 people through traveling art shows and events around the state and country.
Now, the veteran-founded nonprofit is preparing to launch its fifth edition. Supporters gathered in Columbia ahead of the July Fourth holiday to celebrate and raise the funds to make it happen.
“The amount of healing that we have done is wild,” founder Robert LeHeup told the SC Daily Gazette.
LeHeup was among the first groups of United States Marines to push into Afghanistan following 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. His unit helped take control of the Kandahar airport in 2001 and then secured the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.
LeHeup left the Marine Corps in 2004 as a sergeant, returning to South Carolina and enrolling at the University of South Carolina, where he earned a writing degree and began working with different media forms.
“I was dealing with the same issues as so many other veterans when they first get back, which is violence and anger without a place to put it — substance abuse, depression, suicidal ideation — and I hadn’t even really addressed it,” he said.
Then, about 13 years ago, LeHeup gave a talk in Columbia. He spoke about a snowy night on patrol during his final weeks in Kabul. His unit was on high alert after they were told there could be members of the Islamic militant group Al-Qaeda in a nearby home. What LeHeup heard drifting over the embassy walls instead was music from a man playing a homemade flute. He stood listening to the man’s song and icicles like wind chimes in the trees as snowflakes fell around him.
“In the writing of it, I gained a sense of ownership over the story,” LeHeup said. “But that wasn’t anything compared to after I had performed it, because that’s when I knew that my story had been heard. This profound sense of isolation, which had caused all of these different problems, was being addressed through my telling of the story and knowing that people had heard it.”
He started Bullets and Bandaids to give other veterans a similar experience.
LeHeup records interviews with veterans, friends and family. Then, that recording is fact checked and shared with a volunteer writer, often someone who has not been in the military, who turns it into a written story. Finally, an artist will create a painting, music poetry or other work of art inspired by the story.
“We’ve had people say things like, I wouldn’t have been able to tell my wife this story were it not for Bullets and Bandaids. I’m still alive today because you guys are continuing to tour. I wouldn’t be here were it not for the connections that I had made,” LeHeup said.
By pairing veterans with civilian writers and artists, LeHeup said the group also works to bridge the divide that often exists between military members and those without a military connection.
“I think veterans are forced to be in one of two boxes, either they are broken or they are heroes that need nothing,” LeHeup said. “I believe that our humanity, our lives, are in the gray area in between. And I hope that civilians will recognize that we live in that gray area, and that both civilians and veterans find the strength in acknowledging that shared human journey.”
Kristine Hartvigsen, of Columbia, was never in the military herself but her father spent his career in the U.S. Army as a physician. Her aunt was an Army nurse during the war in Vietnam. Her son enlisted, too, deploying twice — in 2017 to Afghanistan and last year to Syria — and currently stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia.
“I do have just a real strong affinity for veterans and am trying to understand my son’s experience better by learning from other vets, because he was definitely changed when he came home,” Hartvigsen said.
About four years ago, she volunteered as a writer for Bullets and Bandaids after learning about it from a friend.
“What I really hear is the stuff that I think about when my son is deployed. I’m trying to picture where he is, what he sees, what he’s doing. So it’s the little details that veterans share,” Hartvigsen said.
One story that particularly stuck with her came from Corey Norrell, a self-proclaimed Navy brat who enlisted when he turned 18. He told her about a rite of passage in the U.S. Navy, known as the crossing the line ceremony, held when a sailor crosses the equator for the first time and becomes a “trusty shellback” or a “Son of Neptune.”
The “shellbacks” crawl on their hands and knees across the non-skid deck with a surface so rough “sandpaper doesn’t hold a candle to it,” he said.
“It’s not a combat story, but it’s part of the experience, because there’s a brotherhood and sisterhood that forms among military service members,” Hartvigsen said.
Hartvigsen said her son prefers not to speak about his deployments but she does remember talking to him on the phone and him telling her he could see enemy soldiers in the distance from the wall he was standing on.
“It was just shocking to me that he could see them across the way. But unless they fire, they’re all just watching each other and that’s stressful in itself, just not knowing what’s going to happen,” Hartvigsen said.

Unlike Hartvigsen, Andrew Cooke was in the military — the U.S. Air Force — and also produces art for Bullets and Bandsaids.
Cooke retired from the Air Force as a staff sergeant in 2012 after developing a heart condition following an injury sustained during an attack on Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, where he was deployed in 2010. He’d also done earlier tours in Kandahar and Al Dahfra, in the United Arab Emirates.
After leaving the Air Force, Cooke took up photography as part of therapy. He particularly liked photographing storms and landscapes near his home in Tucson, Arizona. Being in nature and away from crowded spaces calmed him.
The Darlington native then moved back to South Carolina and currently lives in Spartanburg, working as a construction manager. He still does photography on the side.
Cooke, who is now on the board of directors for Bullets and Bandaids, finds value in how the organization connects civilians and veterans and the level of appreciation that develops between the soldiers and their story tellers.
Cooke said Bullets and Bandaids needs financial help from the community to keep going. The organization is supported both by private donations and government grants, including a $10,000 grant from the state Arts Commission for 2025 and $10,000 from the state Humanities Council in 2024.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/480254257_958379533058526_6374661688534519078_n-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

Barry Usher, R-Billings area, against members of the public and another Democratic legislator.
Dunwell is making the allegations with the Montana Human Rights Bureau, which enforces laws that prohibit discrimination as part of the Department of Labor and Industry.
Usher, who served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he does not believe the bureau has jurisdiction.
However, if it does, Usher said he expects to prevail — as he did in a similar case Dunwell filed during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
In a summary of initial allegations Dunwell submitted to the Human Rights Bureau, Dunwell argues Usher’s behavior constituted unlawful discrimination against members of the public who testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and against Sen. Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, who served as vice chairwoman of the committee.
“There were numerous instances of Sen. Usher shutting down, belittling and verbally and emotionally abusing (members of the public and committee members) or silencing and refusing them questions, especially Minority Party Vice Chair of Judiciary Committee Andrea Olsen,” said the summary of allegations.
Olsen could not be reached for comment through voicemails left Wednesday and Thursday. The allegations also state she was treated unfairly after raising concern about the lack of public notice for a hearing.
Dunwell said the Human Rights Bureau initially accepted the case, and she is submitting additional material and may name more respondents.
Montana Human Rights Bureau Chief Tim Little could not be reached late Wednesday or Thursday about the status of the case.
In a description of its process, the Human Rights Bureau website said it will draft a formal complaint “if the facts indicate illegal discrimination may have occurred” following an intake interview.
The allegations Dunwell submitted to the agency and shared with the Daily Montanan cover incidents during the 2025 Montana Legislature when Usher led the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Senate Judiciary Committee reviews some of the most controversial bills of the session and often elicits emotional testimony.
The allegations include harassment, retaliation and discrimination based on political belief, sex, and gender identity by Usher “against others with less power than him.”
In an interview, Dunwell said members of the public have the right to share their opinions even if they run contrary to the political beliefs of the chairperson.
She also said she wants to set a standard for more respectful behavior at the Capitol in the future, and she believes women and people who are LGBTQ+ were especially abused.
“I’m going to come and go. He’s going to come and go,” Dunwell said of Usher. “At some point, we just need to say, ‘Stop,’ because we have devolved so much in our decorum and in our treatment of one another.”
The summary of allegations said at least 20 other members of the public and legislators relayed experiences of bullying and harassment by Usher but would not consent to have their names used for fear of retaliation.
In an interview, Usher said he doesn’t believe the Human Rights Bureau, part of the executive branch, has jurisdiction in the case because of the separation of powers. He also said he believes he has legislative immunity.
However, Usher said he treats everyone the same — “whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican or a male or a female.”
For example, Usher said in the past, he shut down Dunwell when he felt “she got out of control” at a hearing, but he also shut down Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell when he “went off the rails” as a bill sponsor.
As committee chairman, Usher said he enforces decorum. Some people at the podium aren’t familiar with the rules, and in those cases, he said he provides instruction to them to keep meetings on track.
“If we have decorum, then we can make it through our agenda,” Usher said.
Dunwell said an attorney advised her the case might butt up against a claim of legislative immunity. However, she said many people who were poorly treated by Usher during the session are quietly encouraging her to pursue the complaint.
An email from Dunwell to the Human Rights Bureau said political activist Evan Barrett will join her in alleging unfair treatment, and Barrett confirmed Thursday he believes Usher trampled on his right to participate and abused his power.
Barrett, a Butte Democrat, said when he tried to testify by video in a hearing against a bill to require judges to declare a political party, Usher cut off testimony. Barrett said he alerted Olsen that he — and later, he found out, a couple of others — still hadn’t testified.
Olsen alerted Usher, but the chairman refused to recognize him, Barrett said. Barrett said he later emailed Usher and informed him he was violating the state Constitution by suppressing the right to participate.
After “rattling his cage,” Usher finally relented and scheduled a time for Barrett and a couple of judges who had been left out to testify, Barrett said, but he said Usher then failed to allow Olsen to ask them questions, which is part of the process.
Barrett said he’s a “known commodity as a Democrat” in Montana, and he wonders if his political affiliation influenced Usher’s decision not to recognize him.
Usher said in general, people register in advance to testify, and if they aren’t on his list of registrants, he doesn’t call on them. He said he isn’t vetting lists for people’s political affiliations. He said in this case, a “software glitch” meant Barrett wasn’t on the list, but he testified at a later date.
In a narrative of the allegations, Dunwell outlined more than a dozen instances she said are just some examples of when Usher bullied or shut out the public, Olsen, and other committee members.
In one incident, Olsen tried to point out members of the public who had their hands raised to testify online. Usher said he did not see anyone, but Olsen said she saw at least two hands raised.
Usher said he’d been watching the computer for the last hour, and one person who had their hand raised wasn’t on the list of people who had signed up to testify, a prerequisite.
“I didn’t know if you wanted to do my job?” Usher says to Olsen.
“I’d be happy to, Mr. Chair,” Olsen replies.
“Well, actions have consequences,” Usher says.
In the allegations and phone interview, Dunwell said she had filed an earlier harassment and discrimination complaint against Usher during the 2025 session with the Legislative Services Division.
A Legislative Conduct Panel convened, directed an investigation be conducted, and confirmed the complaint was found to be unsubstantiated, according to a copy of the determination notice Dunwell shared.
It said Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, also made “informal complaints” regarding the same allegations.
The determination was signed by two Republican leaders, Senate President Matt Regier and House Speaker Brandon Ler, and two Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers and House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan.
Asked if the outcome of the Legislative Conduct Panel could indicate Usher’s behavior steps up to a line but doesn’t cross into discrimination, Dunwell said she doesn’t have enough information to know; Dunwell said she requested a copy of the investigation, but she was denied the file based on privacy even though Usher is a public figure.
She said she believes Usher retaliated against her as well by ensuring her bills didn’t pass after she raised concerns with HR.
Usher said he wouldn’t ever ask anyone to take votes they don’t believe in.
He said HR interviewed the parties involved, and the matter, as he sees it, comes down to decorum. He said he and Olsen have a good relationship outside of the committee and talk frequently.
However, in committee, he said, he had to quiet Olsen at times because she would offer longwinded testimony when it was time for questions.
“It appears that sometimes she can’t help herself,” Usher said.
During the session, Olsen had emailed Usher and other committee members in an attempt to ensure legislators were respectful and welcoming to the public and did not “lecture them, argue with them, shame them.”
Sent in late March, the email is part of the packet of materials Dunwell provided to the Human Rights Bureau and shared with the Daily Montanan.
In it, Olsen acknowledged she needed to do a better job of asking “to-the-point” questions, but she said all committee members owe the public respect and decorum.
“I am writing to request that we all remember our obligation to the public, to welcome them to our committee, to allow them to participate, and to hear what they have to tell us about their concerns and perceived consequences of a bill,” Olsen said in her letter.
Olsen forwarded the email to Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, and told him she wished she’d had sent it in January when the session started. She said people were afraid to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Without full public participation, we create bad law with blinders on,” Olsen said in the email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Senate_door_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 12:15:47.707735

“There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago, when Congress passed the one big beautiful bill to make America great again,” Trump said.
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
The president told the crowd of more than 1,000 that “this whole two weeks has been incredible” – pointing to the budget reconciliation bill that passed earlier Thursday, recent U.S. military strikes on Iran and his administration reaching trade deals with other countries.
Trump announces UFC fight at White House
Though much of his speech to the crowd gathered reflected what Iowans may have heard at campaign rallies during recent caucus cycles, Trump’s first Iowa event since January 2024 was the start of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary. Organized by America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June, Trump said there will be a year of celebrations, including sporting events and fairs.
“Every one of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America250 and I even think we’re going to have a UFC fight,” he said.
Trump announced plans to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House as part of his America250 celebration. Trump said UFC CEO Dana White would be organizing the fight. According to a White House Pool report, Trump is “dead serious” about plans for a fight on White House according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
He also said he plans to bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country with the first event taking place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He announced these would culminate in a “giant patriotic festival” with exhibits from all 50 states displayed at the National Mall during the festival.
“We will be orchestrating what we’re calling The Great American State Fair and we’ll start right here in Iowa,” he said.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
Trump supporters emphasize trust
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Trump said he has delivered on many of his campaign promises through the budget reconciliation bill and other actions since taking office earlier in 2025.
“The people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take-home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion – the horrible invasion,” Trump said. “… Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud, and that’s what we’re doing. With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Tien Tran, a California dentist who flew to Iowa for the event, said he does not know all the details in the legislation but supports the measure.
“I don’t even know all the details but I know and I trust this president because he promised. Whatever he promised, he kept,” Tran said. “… President Trump has saved a lot of money for this country. President Trump with his executive order has saved a lot of lives.”
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote.
Though the four representatives did not speak at the event, Trump praised them as a “good group,” saying, “boy, they were so happy at that victory today.”
Trump says legislation planned to allow undocumented workers to stay
In addition to speaking on the budget reconciliation bill, Trump also highlighted legislation and executive action taken on immigration policy, talking about mass deportations under his administration.
However, he shared that there could be a potential caveat to some deportations of undocumented immigrants coming under his administration for people working in the agriculture sector who are not in the country legally. He said he is working with Noem and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on legislation that would allow undocumented workers to stay in the country if they  can get the support and backing of their employers, he said.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, ‘So we have a little problem, the farmers are losing a lot of people,’” he said. “And we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written. And let the farmers be responsible.”
He joked, “and if the farmers don’t do a good job, we’ll throw them the hell out of the country,” while adding he believed the media would not acknowledge the comment as sarcasm.
U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both spoke before Trump’s appearance, speaking about their support for the budget reconciliation bill. Grassley highlighted what he called his biggest contribution to the legislation as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee – saying he was a major backer for the provisions to increase funding for immigration enforcement and border security and for detention centers. These are all steps to “make America safe again,” Grassley said.
Ernst also talked about Republicans’ immigration policy, pointing to Trump signing the immigration bill that included “Sarah’s Law,” a provision requiring the detainment of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury.
This measure was named after Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowan killed by a drunk driver who was an immigrant who lacked legal status. Ernst said this measure passing was one of many actions taken by Trump she supports on immigration.
Protesters outside the US House make a last stand against the GOP megabill

Iowans gather to protest Trump visit
Around 100 people gathered outside of the fairgrounds Thursday evening with protest signs, upside down American flags and megaphones to protest the president’s visit to Des Moines.
One protester, Maureen Ogle of Ames, waved her flag rightside up and pumped a cane in the air as cars drove past, honking in support of the protesters.
Ogle said she flew a flag upside down during the entirety of Trump’s first term, but now she wants to “reclaim” the national symbol. 
“I want to save the Republic,” Ogle said. “The constitution has been demolished.”

We already know that in Iowa, at least 20 rural hospitals are seriously threatened with closing and six are almost certainly gone. The problem is greater than hospitals closing or individuals being denied immediate, necessary medical care. The impact is going to be felt by the communities that are home to those medical care centers.
Our challenge will be, as a state, how we handle the impact of loss for many of those on Medicaid coverage, and the drastic cutbacks on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The real proof of the magnitude of the problem is that nationwide, 70 million people are on Medicaid and 40 million are beneficiaries of SNAP.  Furthermore, the effect is even greater in rural states.
Our first concern must be for care centers and hospitals.  Hospitals are rather mysterious places by design. This is because the nature of the work is confidential. Everyone is entitled to privacy when treated medically. In addition, the institution funding is a total dark web with government payments, insurance coverage, write-offs, etc.  So, they exist somewhat in isolation from the rest of town.
But the individuals who work at hospitals are not a secret. They are your neighbors, shop at the same stores, serve on their church communities, coach the little league softball and baseball teams, send their kids to our schools, and take a place on the school board or city councils.
But when the hospital closes, they will be different because (a) they will be unemployed and (b) they will find work someplace else.  It is not just the medical staff, nurses, doctors, techs, and the bookkeepers who chase the insurance companies for reimbursement (may God have mercy on their souls), but the electricians, the administrative staff, and the janitors, all or most who will be moving on and taking their kids out of the rural public schools.
We need to face the reality of the situation now.  The impact of this legislation is going to affect more than the patient.  It is a body blow not only to employees but to the very town in which the hospital resides. Yes, the bill includes $50 billion for rural hospitals affected by Medicaid cuts. It’s not nearly enough.
The solution isn’t rocket science. Rural states, like Iowa, are going to have to find money to replace the lost revenue from a former Medicaid patient who shows up at the hospital for treatment without insurance coverage. Both Iowa law and most hospitals’ mission statement requires that the patient receive treatment.  This may surprise the proponents of kicking patients off Medicaid, which flies in the face of their belief that if coverage is cut, then people would just decide not to get sick.) We can’t just lock them out.
The approach needs to be systematic and focused first on the rural hospitals most at risk. We need to examine and reduce or eliminate the cost of a rule, regulation, or statute that is not essential to the practice of good medical care.
The utility costs of the individual institution should be examined and either the state or the utility should determine whether the fees charged can be reduced or even eliminated. It is better to have less revenue from the cost of the operation of the buildings than none.
The mission and resources assigned to the Iowa Economic Development Authority should be amended to target rural health care.  The state’s entire economic development budget, which goes to various agencies, is about $40 million for next year (and should be increased). While it is great to lure foreign business entities to our state or convenience those that are departing, our first priority should be state resources for Iowans first, then others. The truth is that a hospital in a smaller community is an asset and should not be thrown out because of this legislation.
Those are a few of the steps that we can take to overcome these new laws. I reason that if towns like Marshalltown, Greenfield, Parkersburg and others can overcome and rebuild after tornadoes, we can do the same with this economic windstorm.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hopsital-image-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

A sprinkle of rocking chairs, kitchen sinks and family photos in Mississippi Museum of Art’s “2025 Mississippi Invitational” exhibition pepper the galleries with near universal touchstones. Signs of love and signs of loss, frayed connections, conflicting expectations, notions of belonging and the creep of time come through in artworks, too, evoking the deeply personal relationships and complex emotional ties forged in that place called home.
The museum’s 14th biennial survey of recent works by contemporary visual artists living and working in the state opens a fresh window into Mississippi and into this particular moment. The exhibition is on view through Sept. 7.
Its 12 featured artists were selected from about 180 applications and 37 studio visits across the state. Guest curator TK Smith, an Atlanta-based writer, curator and cultural historian, drew on his conversations with artists in their studios and tapped into his own summer visits with grandparents in Mississippi for the exhibition’s “Call Home” theme.
“All of these artists are reaching out — reaching to connect in some way, either to their audiences, to other artists, to communities, for political reasons, personal reasons,” Smith said. “Everybody is just kind of yearning, and I think that is shaping the work that’s in the show.”
Both up-and-coming and established artists are among the show’s 12, with creations covering a broad swath of media. Painting, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, photography, film, assemblage, installation and more deliver a diverse, vibrant and provocative portrait of the state of art in Mississippi. Unfolding across three sections, or “three breaths” in Smith’s words, the exhibition explores home as a physical space, as a body and beyond, and artists’ works in each section showcase their individual range.
An actual phone opens the exhibition — the vintage Panasonic Easa-Phone telephone and answering machine in artist Emma Lorenz’s “You Have XX Messages.” Personal voicemails and audio from the Golden Record combine in Lorenz’s study of how technological progress can risk losing touch with the past, and how even content inaccessible in the moment is still proof of life, care and love.
Lush hues on handmade paper lend beauty, depth and inviting texture to domestic scenes in a suite of paintings by Ocean Springs artist Jerrod Partridge. An open fridge, a puddle of clothes, even a laundry room peek of a baby lulled to sleep by the dryer, put viewers right at home in the messy comforts of daily life. Other exhibition works highlight coastal natural surroundings and, in a nod to the much-traveled artist’s global home, a series of drawings from Italy. Partridge was awarded the Invitational’s Jane Crater Hiatt Artist Fellowship, a $20,000 grant that he will use to develop a series of paintings about communities within the Gulf Coast’s seafood industry.
Laser cut metal fronds arc up from a circle of sandbags, forming a prickly dome in “Garden Pavilion (Cutgrass)” by Connor Frew of Jackson. Inspired by a semi-aquatic grass with serrated leaves that can cut skin, Frew tucked in concepts of resilience and resistance in wilderness, likening the sandbags’ text to a search engine query of how to grow strong enough to destroy the blades (in stronger language). 
“It’s this idea of wild, unrestrained growth and collectivity as a means of resisting attempts at culling, or destroying a particular community.”
Wander through the large-scale pop-ups in Sue Carrie Drummond’s installation “My Mold Garden,” drawn from an artist book collaboration with a cultural anthropologist (digital copy of the book also on display). Post-heartbreak grief coupled with mold growth in the home became a journey to emotional self-help. 
“It puts you in the experience of someone who is dealing with slow breakdown, and then how they put themselves back together. And, the mold mimics that,” Drummond said, breaking down matter to raw material that can be re-used. 
“A Beautiful Snare,” another interactive installation, confronts ideas of femininity through the etymology of lace. Its maze of voile, chiffon, charmeuse and cotton panels deepen from white to reddish hues, with increasingly intense coil designs the farther inside you wander. Is it fragile or strong? A lure or a snare, enticement or entrapment, or maybe both?
Artist Alexis McGrigg’s works in photography, film and painting embody deep family and ancestral ties, as in “A Personal Constellation.” There, gold leaf signifies departed members in a collection of old family photographs, to moving effect. Those are the souls that have touched “The Beloved” (her term for a heaven-like space, or origin of humanity). 
“We have these people that are connected to us, that are no longer here,” McGrigg said, thinking of them as guardians who still watch over her.
A family photo finds a place, too, in Christina McField’s home scene installation, soothing in its details of a crocheted afghan on a rocking chair, worn books, antique table and the framed 1920s photo on its surface. It pictures her great-grandmother with her grandfather, then a small child, standing atop that very table. 
“I wanted to bring them back to life and honor them,” McField said, fondly recalling family visits to Philadelphia, Miss., as a child. “This is what I think about when I think about calling home.” 
Elsewhere in the exhibit, her sculptural triptych assembles architectural scraps — ceiling tiles, spindles, brackets — in a meditation on past lives, the erosion of time and enduring fragments of memory.
Groupings of Hattiesburg ceramicist Allen Chen’s remarkable vessels channel generations of ancestors and migratory patterns, from the “original tribe” of earthen-hued pairs to different colored and carved “offsprings” bearing the changes new environments bring. 
Forms are similar, “the bones” are the same, he said, but colors — a surface quality, like skin tone — are different. 
“Home is not really a static place. We would like it to be, but wherever you end up comes from long lines of people moving around.” 
Chen’s “Passage of the Spine,” with its concentric ceramic shapes suspended in a horizontal line, may call to mind ancient whale fossils. The shadow this large piece casts only heightens its dramatic appeal.
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” selected artists also include: Rylee Brabham, with sculptures and installations exploring gender and society, with a dash of humor; Kaleena Stasiak, with windsocks, mobile and folk warnings about the weather conveying whimsy and wisdom; Ashley Gates, whose touching installation overlays images of her late mother with projections of a solar eclipse; and documentary photographer Betty Press, whose eye for intimacy and design shines through in photos of home births, pairings of Kenyan and Mississippi storefronts and more.
Three larger-than-life sculptures by Jason Kimes of Laurel follow a life cycle through the galleries, each one bearing a name that, together, form Julius Caesar’s famous phrase. A fetal position baby in clear epoxy is the blank-slate start (“Veni’). The 8-foot striding figure in weathering steel, made of thousands of individually welded squares, carries the rusty patina of experience (“Vidi”) and a noble skull in polished stainless gleams at the exhibit’s close (“Vidi”).
 “You start with nothing. You build up all the way through until you end up with something praiseworthy,” Kimes described a lifespan. And then, “It’s the ultimate call home.”
“2025 Mississippi Invitational” is on view at the Mississippi Museum of Art, 380 S. Lamar St. in Jackson, through Sept. 7.

[…]","Topeka Police Officers line the first floor rotunda area of the Statehouse during a May 2023 ceremony. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ crime rate in 2024 reached its lowest mark in at least 20 years, according to recently released data, and some attribute the drop to law enforcement success.
Violent crimes saw a five-year low in 2024, and property crimes maintained a downward trend, per the Kansas Bureau of Investigation’s annual crime index report.
“We believe the collaborative efforts of law enforcement agencies throughout Kansas have an impact on bringing down crime, as does the public’s cooperation and assistance when major crimes are committed,” said KBI director Tony Mattivi.
The report has been published in some form at the KBI since 2003. It compiles data from local and state law enforcement agencies, creating a snapshot of the year’s crimes while reflecting greater trends when compared to past years.
A crime index rate is the number of recorded crimes per 1,000 people in a given year. Kansas’ rate decreased from 27 crimes per 1,000 people in 2023 to 23.3 in 2024. The report said it’s the lowest rate in more than 20 years.
“When assessing crime on a statewide basis, it is difficult to understand what drives crime from year to year because so many factors influence crime trends,” Mattivi said.
The state’s murder rate, for instance, fell below the 10-year average. With 117 murders in 2024, it marked a more than 25% decrease from 2023.
“Finding a common circumstance for these murders is difficult,” the report said, “as 46.2% of the reports indicated ‘unknown circumstance.’ ”
Murders in 2024 involved arguments, domestic violence and unknown suspects. Making up smaller fractions were illegal drug transactions, which totaled 2.6% of murders, and gang activity and drive-by incidents, which made up less than 1% of murders in 2024.
All crime categories decreased in 2024. Some numbers were fractions of pre-pandemic averages and others made history. Around 7,100 burglaries were reported in Kansas in 2024, the lowest number since 1966, when around 10,700 burglaries were reported, according to the report.
Wyandotte County had the highest reported crime index rate in the state, with nearly 47 crimes per 1,000 people. Sedgwick County was a close second with a rate of nearly 44. The lowest reported crime index rate in 2024 was 0.7 in Jewell County, though the county sheriff’s office only reported seven months out of the year.
The number of law enforcement officers employed in Kansas is inching closer to its pre-pandemic level of 3.84 officers per 1,000 people, according to data from the FBI. The number of employed law enforcement officers rose between 2023 and 2024 from 3.44 to 3.69.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach took credit for the decrease in crime rates, attributing it to his “law and order approach.”
“Kansans are less likely to be the victim of a crime today than at any time in the past 20 years,” Kobach said in a news release, which referred to him as Kansas’s chief law enforcement officer.
While crime has decreased nationally in the past three decades, Americans still worry just as much — if not more — about their safety and the presence of crime, according to Gallup polling.
Around half of Americans who participated in 2024 surveys worry about crime a great deal, and few are satisfied with policies addressing crime. Americans perceive that crime is growing in the areas where they live. Almost half of Americans polled in 2024 thought crime increased over the previous year, when crime nationwide has been on a steep downward trend since the 1990s.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05182023-officervigil-6-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

(Phot courtesy of the National Archives)Exactly 249 years ago, a group of flawed-yet-visionary men signed a document in Philadelphia that was (and remains) remarkable.
It founded a nation that’s been a beacon of hope to the entire world. Is America perfect? No, of course not, and it never has been. But the grand experiment that is American democracy is certainly worth celebrating.
So, we’re running the text of the Declaration of Independence in full as a reminder of the nation’s foundational ideals of freedom and equality. Before the cookouts and fireworks, read the reason for the holiday:  
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. – That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, – That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. – Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

You can read more about the section here.

Everything seems to be turned upside down.
President Donald Trump is asking the federal courts to ignore what our United States Constitution says and to rule against birthright citizenship.
The president is asking the Supreme Court to reverse what has been law since 1868 when the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified. The 14th Amendment states clearly that people born in America are American. It is known as birthright citizenship.
As director of the Lowndes County-based Saving Grace Mission, I hear from people — including many children — who unfortunately say their American citizenship is being questioned.
I was born in Louisiana to Mexican-American parents with indigenous roots and grew up in Texas before moving to my adopted Mississippi. As an advocate for immigrants and the daughter of immigrants, it breaks my heart what American children are having to go through.
“You can’t just take away someone’s birthright,” said a 17-year-old Hispanic female from Caledonia High School, a school that had the nickname the “Confederates” until it was finally changed in 2020.

“The kids in my class threaten to call ICE on my parents every day,” said a 13-year-old at the same school. “I’m bullied just because I’m Hispanic, but I’m American. I was born here.”
When I see the fear of our own community members who serve and give back, fear for their lives, it is very alarming. It is especially alarming when it is the federal government responsible for this fear — fear even being experienced by U.S.-born children.
It is unfortunate for American children to be so afraid of their own government.
“Save the children” is our U.S. motto, and we shouldn’t allow our president to torment our own with fear of separation of families who are part of closely knit groups in these communities.
“Would you know where to go?” I asked a 43-year-old mother of four and grandmother of two who is a native of Mexico, but has been a resident of north Mississippi for the past 24 years. Her children and grandchildren live in the area, too, and are U.S. citizens — born right here in Mississippi.
“No, where would we go?” she asked. “This is our home, and we have a new baby. We can’t go anywhere.”
I asked her if she is afraid.
“I trust the Justice Department, but it seems like he (Trump) gets to do whatever he wants and gets away with whatever he wants anyway, so that’s what’s scary,” she said.
Another scare tactic the Trump administration has used to diminish people of color is the 1798 Alien Enemies Act law, which gives the president the authority to remove non-citizens in times of war.
Sadly, depression and anxiety are at an all-time high with the lack of community resources due to lack of funding for the immigrant population — especially here in Mississippi.

Connecticut Mirror reporters, who had followed dozens of bills from the concept phase and through committee votes, were keeping tabs on when they’d be called for votes in the House and Senate. Some sailed through, some were slowed down by proposed amendments or filibusters. And some died before receiving a final vote.
Around half of the bills CT Mirror tracked this session did not make it through both chambers — or died in committee, before even reaching the House or Senate. 
Out of the 107 bills CT Mirror tracked this session, 32 were rolled into other legislation, most often the state budget — a sprawling 795-page bill outlining how the state will raise and spend money. Many bills that pass through committees are appended to the budget bill as the final days of the session near, particularly legislation that comes with a significant pricetag.
Five bills CT Mirror tracked never made it beyond the committee phase, where legislation is first raised and debated. Every bill in Connecticut’s legislature has to go through at least one committee before reaching the House or Senate.
Of the bills we tracked that received favorable committee votes, 45 failed to come up for a vote in either the House, the Senate, or both. 
Bills that do pass both chambers are then sent to Gov. Ned Lamont to be signed into law. So far, 21 of the bills CT Mirror tracked have been signed into law and two are still waiting for the governor’s signature. 
Of all the bills that have reached Lamont’s desk as of July 1st, he has signed 165 bills, signed and line-item vetoed 2 bills, and vetoed 2 bills. Committees and members of the General Assembly — which is made up of 151 state representatives and 36 state senators — raise bills for consideration. The Office of Legislative Research assigns each bill to the relevant committee. Leaders of those committees decide whether to hold public hearings on each bill, after which committee members vote on whether to advance the legislation. If they do, those bills land before House or Senate leadership.
During the final weeks of the session, caucus leaders negotiate with their members to add or rewrite language in legislation in order to secure support before bringing bills up for votes. Some of those conversations are happening right up until the final hours on the last day of the session.
A bill must pass both chambers, before heading to the governor’s desk for a signature — or veto.

At background are Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak (left) and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham (right). (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives said Thursday that he had “no doubt” that he was going to vote for the Republican-drafted budget bill that passed the House on a 218-214 vote Thursday.
In a phone call after the vote Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, said he was pleased that it provides additional opportunities for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and Cook Inlet. 
“I think the bill has some incredible provisions for Alaska. We have been trying for decades to unlock the energy potential of our state, and this bill does that,” Begich said. “There’s 30 million acres mandated as a minimum lease sale amount in ANWR, NPR-A and the Cook Inlet that gives us the oil and gas that we need to refill our our state coffers, ensure that the Permanent Fund is well funded into the future, that we can continue to pay PFDs well into the future.”
Begich had proposed that 90% of federal revenue from federal leases in those areas be returned to the state. The final version of the bill will send 70%, starting in 2034. 
Current law states that 50% of revenue is reserved for local communities. The remaining 20% will be available for the state’s general fund, Begich said. 
In an interview with reporters on Wednesday, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he believes no state fared better than Alaska in the negotiations around the bill.
“I think it is true when you look at just the pure acreage (available for oil leasing). Just on this one provision alone, Alaska stands to gain tremendously,” Begich said.
Most criticism of the bill has focused on its effects on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank opposed to the bill, estimated that 35,000 Alaskans would lose health insurance if the bill becomes law, both from Medicaid cuts and from scaled-back tax credits used to pay for individual policies.
In a town hall meeting Wednesday night, State Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, said she estimates the bill will add $100 million to $200 million in Medicaid costs to the state, and SNAP changes will require the state to pay up to $50 million per year within a few years.
The bill increases the size of a rural hospital fund, which will send $200 million to $300 million to Alaska, Sens. Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said on Tuesday. 
“There’s a lot of uncertainty with a new program,” Mina said, “whereas Medicaid has reliably funded our rural areas and supported our communities and has been a fabric of our health care economy for so long.”
She also pointed out that the bill creates a work requirement for Medicaid.
“Given the fact that we already know so many Alaskans who are behind on their SNAP and Medicaid benefits for months, this is going to add more paperwork and bureaucracy for our state, but then also for people on the ground, they’re going to be kicked off of Medicaid because of additional paperwork, even though folks are working,” she said.
Asked whether he thinks Alaska will be entirely shielded from the effects of those cuts, Begich implied that the answer is no, but he believes “we have significant runway that’s been provided for Alaska” via various sections of the bill.
“Traditional recipients of Medicaid will continue to receive the same benefits that they deserve to receive. There are no changes to the traditional Medicaid system,” Begich said.
When it comes to the work requirement, there are “exclusions for folks who are caregivers to family members, for folks who are looking for work but haven’t found it yet, for folks who are in counties or boroughs with more than one and a half times the national average unemployment rate. It has exclusions for people who volunteer 20 hours a week.”
“If someone is able to work or contribute in some way, even volunteer, they should do that. And I think that’s a smart provision. It’s a provision that’s really targeted, and it’s been designed just for that sub-population of folks who could be helping and are not currently doing so,” he said.
During his campaign for U.S. House in 2024, Begich told the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce that Alaskans should expect him to seek less federal spending because he is concerned about the size of the national debt. 
The Congressional Budget Office expects the new budget bill to increase the federal debt by more than $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.
“Well, I think I would dispute that,” Begich said, explaining that he believes the CBO is underestimating economic growth that will take place because of the tax cuts within the bill.
“We’re on the cusp of an AI revolution, a robotics revolution, tremendous gains are on the horizon for labor productivity. We’re seeing the labor market remain strong. … I think the challenge with the CBO and some of the other models is that they’re scoring the assumptive growth rate exceptionally low.”
The 2017 federal tax cuts being extended by the new bill have thus far failed to create growth necessary to balance the deficits they created.
Begich said he’s been a strong supporter of the budget bill since even before it was proposed at the start of the new Congress.
“There was no doubt I was going to vote for this bill,” he said. “I started working on this bill before I was even sworn into Congress. I approached leadership when it looked like we were going to win this seat. And I told them, budget reconciliation is around the corner.”
Begich said that House leaders tried to reassure him that ANWR drilling provisions would be in the bill, but he advocated more drilling, in NPR-A and Cook Inlet, and additional provisions to support mining and logging.
“So when this bill came back from the Senate, I was enthusiastically supporting it, and I told others in the House that this is an important priority for us, certainly, but it’s really important for the rest of the nation,” Begich said.

(Getty Images)We’re republishing the text of the Declaration of Independence in full today on America’s 249th birthday.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)President Donald Trump took a victory lap celebrating the passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through Congress during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday evening while sharing plans for the upcoming year of celebrations for the nation’s 250th anniversary.
“There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago, when Congress passed the one big beautiful bill to make America great again,” Trump said.
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
The president told the crowd of more than 1,000 that “this whole two weeks has been incredible” – pointing to the budget reconciliation bill that passed earlier Thursday, recent U.S. military strikes on Iran and his administration reaching trade deals with other countries.
Trump announces UFC fight at White House
Though much of his speech to the crowd gathered reflected what Iowans may have heard at campaign rallies during recent caucus cycles, Trump’s first Iowa event since January 2024 was the start of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary. Organized by America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June, Trump said there will be a year of celebrations, including sporting events and fairs.
“Every one of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America250 and I even think we’re going to have a UFC fight,” he said.
Trump announced plans to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House as part of his America250 celebration. Trump said UFC CEO Dana White would be organizing the fight. According to a White House Pool report, Trump is “dead serious” about plans for a fight on White House according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
He also said he plans to bring America250 programming to fairgrounds across the country with the first event taking place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. He announced these would culminate in a “giant patriotic festival” with exhibits from all 50 states displayed at the National Mall during the festival.
“We will be orchestrating what we’re calling The Great American State Fair and we’ll start right here in Iowa,” he said.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
Trump supporters emphasize trust
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
““I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to,” Reicks said.
Trump said he has delivered on many of his campaign promises through the budget reconciliation bill and other actions since taking office earlier in 2025.
“The people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take-home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion – the horrible invasion,” Trump said. “… Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud, and that’s what we’re doing. With this bill, every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept.”

Tien Tran, a California dentist who flew to Iowa for the event, said he does not know all the details in the legislation but supports the measure.
“I don’t even know all the details but I know and I trust this president because he promised. Whatever he promised, he kept,” Tran said. “… President Trump has saved a lot of money for this country. President Trump with his executive order has saved a lot of lives.”
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
A plan to allow some immigrants to stay
In addition to speaking on the budget reconciliation bill, Trump also highlighted legislation and executive action taken on immigration policy, talking about mass deportations under his administration.
However, he shared that there could be a potential caveat to some deportations of undocumented immigrants coming under his administration for people working in the agriculture sector who are not in the country legally. He said he is working with Noem and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on legislation that would allow undocumented workers to stay in the country if they  can get the support and backing of their employers, he said.
“Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, ‘So we have a little problem, the farmers are losing a lot of people,’” he said. “And we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written. And let the farmers be responsible.”
He joked, “and if the farmers don’t do a good job, we’ll throw them the hell out of the country,” while adding he believed the media would not acknowledge the comment as sarcasm.
U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both spoke before Trump’s appearance, speaking about their support for the budget reconciliation bill. Grassley highlighted what he called his biggest contribution to the legislation as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee – saying he was a major backer for the provisions to increase funding for immigration enforcement and border security and for detention centers. These are all steps to “make America safe again,” Grassley said.
“We’re going to finish the wall,” Grassley said. “… We’re going to add tremendously to the number of people patrolling that border, but more importantly, the number of people that are going to enforce the immigration laws (on the) interior, not just at the border.”
Trump highlights recent trade negotiations
Though Trump did not make major announcements about deals reached with any countries Thursday, he highlighted recent trade negotiations he said will benefit Iowa during his speech.
Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set a baseline 10% tariffs on international imports, while he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement; they are set to go into effect on July 9.
Trump said he plans to begin sending letters to countries Friday dictating tariff rates.
Though the contents of these letters were not discussed in his remarks, Trump did highlight the trade deal reached with Vietnam Wednesday that was a part of the larger push to renegotiate tariffs.
In a social media post Wednesday, Trump wrote there will be a 20% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. and 40% on goods shipped through Vietnam, but that in return, Vietnam will “give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade.”
Details on the trade deal with Vietnam have not yet been released. But Trump said the deal will have substantial impacts on Iowa agriculture by allowing more American products to enter Vietnam, “with zero tariffs.”
“You’re going to be giving them vast amounts of farm product, including beef, pork, poultry, dairy and pure Iowa ethanol,” Trump said. “You’re going to be giving all of those, all of those products.”
He also said he got “beef and ethanol into Europe,” speaking on a trade deal reached with the United Kingdom in May.
Many farmers, businesses owners and agricultural producers have expressed concern that they will be unable to absorb the added costs of the tariffs leading to disruptions for their business and higher costs to consumers. A study by Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025 and are set to increase going forward.
Iowans gather to protest Trump visit to Des Moines
Around 100 people gathered outside of the fairgrounds Thursday evening with protest signs, upside down American flags and megaphones to protest the president’s visit to Des Moines.
One protester, Maureen Ogle of Ames, waved her flag rightside up and pumped a cane in the air as cars drove past, honking in support of the protesters.
Ogle said she flew a flag upside down during the entirety of Trump’s first term, but now she wants to “reclaim” the national symbol. 
“I want to save the Republic,” Ogle said. “The constitution has been demolished.”

Some cars drove past Ogle and other protesters along East University Ave and hurled expletives and flipped birds. Protesters yelled things like “you’re in a cult” and “Trump’s coming after you too” as cars turned into the gates of the fairgrounds at East 33rd Street.
Ogle said the sitting president is the only thing she has protested as passionately as she protested the Vietnam war in her 20s.
Stephanie Shearer, from Des Moines, said if it were a different president visiting, she probably would not have shown up — as an attendee or protester —but, she said Trump needs to be held accountable.
“Hes’ so controversial that I have to be here,” she said.
Shearer said she wanted immigrants and other communities who feel attacked by the administration to know there are Iowans “on the good side.”
Plus, she said the passing of the mega budget bill earlier in the day means more people are targeted by the Trump agenda.
“We all have to keep showing each other that we’re here for each other,” Shearer said. 
Marianne Satinsky drove down from the Iowa City region to protest. She said being able to protest was a way for her to express the feelings she had, especially after the passing of the big beautiful bill.
“I felt like if I were at home right now … I would be so mad,” Satinsky said. “So this is something I can do.”
Satinsky said she hoped the presidential motorcade came past the crowd on its way to the grandstands.
“He’s got to see not everyone is happy with what he’s doing,” Satinsky said.
A handful of protesters also gathered on overpasses along Intestate 235 with large signs, hoping to picket the presidential motorcade on its route to the state fairgrounds.
The 50501 Iowa Coalition, which has organized a number of protests against the current administration, was one of the groups organizing protesters Thursday afternoon. Erienne Becker, an organizer with the coalition, said the Iowans she knows are “not OK with what is happening right now.”
“Our goal for this is to let Trump, and his supporters in our state know, and by his supporters I mean (elected officials), but we want to make sure that he knows hate is not welcome in our state,” Becker said.
Becker said she was “so upset” with Iowa congressional leaders for “not listening to their constituents” and voting in favor of the bill, and it weighs “heavy on our hearts.”
“But it’s all the more reason for us to stand up, and stand against this,” Becker said.

Since Congress had appropriated the money in the recent continuing resolution, we had no reason to believe otherwise.”
The U.S. Department of Education informed states on Monday that it would withhold the $6.8 billion in grants, one day before they were due to be sent out. The notice did not provide any timeline or reason for the move, saying “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”

Richard Franklin, president of the Birmingham chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, said in an interview Thursday that the withholding of congressionally-approved funds should have never happened in the first place.
“They’re using our kids as political pawns to prove a point politically, when we should all be providing our kids with an education,” he said. “That’s the one thing we should be doing, the one thing we’ve always done in this country.”
Michael Sibley, the director of communications at ALSDE, did not have an available list of programs affected or a copy of the email sent to superintendents. The affected programs, according to the Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, include:

Title I-C, on migrant education
Title II-A, on improving the effectiveness of teachers and school leaders
Title III-A, on English language acquisition
Title IV-A, on STEM education, college and career counseling and other activities
Title IV-B, on before- and after-school programs and summer school programs
Grants geared toward adult education and literacy programs

Franklin said with school starting in just over a month, it was one of the worst times to change funding. Because of the short notice, if local school districts cannot afford to pay the impacted teachers’ salaries, they would likely be let go.
“It’s just so dangerous what they’re doing, and we’re so close to school,” Franklin said. “They don’t have a lot of guidelines to what they’re doing, just to say ‘we’re investigating.’”
He said that rural and inner city school systems would be the most impacted by the lack of funds, like Montgomery Public Schools and Gadsden City Schools. A message seeking comment with both systems’ superintendents was left Thursday.
“We are hopeful that the review period will be expedited, and funds will be released quickly,”  Mackey wrote. “However, we look forward to working expeditiously with our colleagues in Washington as we are only weeks away from the beginning of a new school year and wish to avoid any disruption in services for our students and their families.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpmcmahon-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 09:03:35.531180

(Photo by Michael Smith/Getty Images)Almost every year, a wildfire is started somewhere in Utah because of fireworks. Just this week, the Draper Fire Department said a small fire was started in the foothills above the city, likely from someone shooting fireworks from the window of a passing car. 
Crews were able to extinguish the fire by early Thursday morning, but it serves as a reminder of how quickly Fourth of July celebrations can spiral out of control. 
When are fireworks allowed in Utah? 
The Fourth of July is one of four holidays where setting off fireworks is allowed in Utah for a period of time. The other three are Pioneer Day on July 24, New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year’s Eve. 
Hot and windy weather prompts statewide fire restrictions and a call for prayer

Typically there’s a two-day buffer around the holiday itself. For instance, this month fireworks are permitted between July 2-5, and July 22-25, according to the State Fire Marshal. 
Where can you set off fireworks? 
Even with that window, fireworks are still prohibited in much of the state. Utah is currently under State 1 fire restrictions, which bans fireworks on all state and federally managed land, and all unincorporated land (land that is not within a city’s jurisdiction). 
That means no fireworks are allowed in state parks, national parks, Bureau of Land Management land, national forest or other public land. 
Most of the state’s main population centers also have some kind of restriction in place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t set off fireworks, and Utah code actually prevents cities from enacting a citywide ban of state-approved explosives in most cases. 
Instead, cites can only restrict fireworks “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions,” which includes mountainous areas covered in brush, forest or dry grass, areas near a river, ravine or wash, undeveloped wildland or agricultural land and more.  
That’s still a pretty broad definition, so most municipalities are able to ban fireworks in the majority of land within their borders.

Salt Lake City, for instance, bans fireworks everywhere except for two stretches between Glendale Park and Interstate 80, and between 900 West and 900 East, south of South Temple.  
Draper bans fireworks everywhere except for a small section between State Street and 1300 East. And St. George bans fireworks in most of the city, except for the more densely populated neighborhoods away from open space and major roadways. 
State law requires municipalities make their firework restrictions easily accessible, and provide residents with an interactive map.
Curious where fireworks are permitted in your city? See the State Fire Marshal’s list of restrictions. 
For Salt Lake County-specific information, see Unified Fire Authority’s interactive map. 
Fire danger in Utah
This year’s holiday comes as most of the state is either in severe or moderate drought, which means fire danger is high. That’s the reasoning behind the fire restrictions, and officials from cities, counties and the state are urging Utahns to celebrate responsibly. 
Most of Utah now in severe or moderate drought

Despite some recent monsoonal moisture giving relief to parts of the state, northern Utah is still abnormally dry. Plus, monsoons can sometimes bring dry lightning and high winds, a near-perfect storm for fire danger. 
Most fires this year — 336 of 448 — have been human caused, resulting in more than 1,000 acres burned.
The cause of the state’s two largest fires have been natural. The France Canyon Fire is currently burning at about 33,300 acres and is 66% contained, while the Forsyth Fire, which destroyed homes in the Pine Valley community north of St. George, is at 13,500 acres and 43% contained.
On Wednesday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox declared July 2 Wildland Firefighter Day in an effort to recognize the work firefighters do to protect homes and forests in the state. 
“Our wildland firefighters are heroes. They face incredible risks to keep us safe and protect the places we love,” Cox said in a statement. “We owe them our gratitude, and that starts with doing our part. This summer, use fireworks wisely, follow local rules, and help prevent the next fire.”

(Courtesy photo)One of the biggest misconceptions about COVID-19 is that the pandemic is over, said Dr. Michelle Harkins, a physician and clinical researcher at the University of New Mexico.
“Well, it’s not over,” Harkins told Source NM in an interview this week. “The pandemic is smoldering. There are still people that are getting sick. You can still get COVID. There’s still a significant burden of Long COVID that we’re going to have to address.”
The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national early indicators, updated on July 30, show that 3% of tests for COVID are coming back positive, and 0.4% of patients in emergency rooms have the infection.
Harkins works as co-medical director of the Post-COVID Primary Care TeleECHO program, which is meant to help primary care providers recognize and diagnose Long COVID, a chronic condition defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an illness that follows a SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least three months. Long COVID includes a variety of symptoms, including respiratory, neurological and digestive ones.
Harkins also is the division chief at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center’s Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine. UNM on June 24 promoted Harkins and four others to distinguished professors, after UNM HSC Internal Medicine Department Chair Mark Unruh nominated her.
“I’ve just been afforded a lot of opportunity here and a lot of great support from my colleagues and my mentors, and I just love my job,” Harkins said. “It is an incredible honor.”
Harkins said there’s a lot of misinformation that claims people no longer need to receive vaccines or wear masks. In fact, vaccination is protective against severe sickness and Long COVID, she said.
“I personally still wear a mask when I’m on a plane and in the airports, because I don’t want to get sick, and I don’t want to bring it home to a family member, or ruin a trip that I’m supposed to go on because I have COVID,” Harkins said.
While no therapies currently exist for Long COVID, Harkins told Source NM that she advises doctors to talk to their patients, believe them and work with them to figure out their goals as we wait to understand what treatments will help.
“Long COVID is not one-size-fits-all,” she said. “We know it’s a huge burden to patients, and patients need answers. No one was listening to them. People were gaslighting them, and it’s real.”
Her co-director Dr. Alisha Parada runs the only Long COVID clinic in New Mexico, where Harkins follows up with patients in her research.
What’s needed are multidisciplinary clinics to address the myriad of symptom complexes that Long COVID patients face, Harkins testified before Congress in January 2024.
“A Long COVID patient might come to a multidisciplinary clinic and need to see a neurologist, a cardiologist, and an internist, all for the same diagnosis of Long Covid,” Harkins told the U.S. Senate HELP Committee.
Earlier in the pandemic, Harkins started a different Project ECHO training program for doctors to treat patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. She turned her focus to a Long COVID clinic for primary care providers when she received new funding.
She led clinical trials for acute COVID treatments, including those that established the effectiveness of antiviral remdesivir and anti-inflammatory baricitinib.
Those led Harkins and her team to become involved in the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER study, which is due to end in October. She and her colleagues have been observing 148 adult patients as part of that study.
Harkins said her team has finished a clinical trial for the oral antiviral Paxlovid, and are currently running two other trials, RECOVER-ENERGIZE Post-Exertional Malaise and RECOVER-SLEEP Complex Sleep Disturbances.
In August, Harkins, Parada and UNM nurse practitioner Debora Bear will join leading Long COVID and other infection-associated chronic condition researchers at a conference in Santa Fe, where they will meet others who manage the disease.
“I’m very excited to go,” she said. “We will learn from others and share our experiences, and see what we can bring home.”

(Courtesy photo)Corey Roybal has dedicated his career to victim services at the state level, starting in 2013 when he joined the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission, a state agency that works to provide financial and other assistance to victims of crime in New Mexico.
He joined Adult Protective Services within the state’s Aging and Long Term Services Department in 2018 as an investigative caseworker. Since then, he has been promoted to a supervisor, regional manager and deputy director. In June, he became its director. 
“His deep knowledge of adult protective services, combined with a harm-reduction and trauma-informed approach make him the right leader to guide this vital division forward,” ALTSD Secretary Emily Kaltenbach said in a written statement.
Source NM recently spoke with Roybal about his work at APS and his approach to helping adult New Mexican victims. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
 
Source NM: How might your time at the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission inform your work at APS?
Roybal: One of the things that I learned there is how to be victim-centered and to really focus on how [we are] being trauma-informed and working with clients at their level. I think a lot of times you focus on the specific individual who’s been the victim, but victimization, it has a ripple effect. It spreads from the victim to the family members to anybody who has direct contact with that client.
I’m sure you know somebody or have come in contact with somebody who has been a victim. And how that network and that community around that individual comes together to support them really builds the foundation for their recovery.

One of the big things that I promote is our job is to inform, educate and empower. Not everybody in caregiving is fully trained.  Sometimes you fall into it just by necessity. And sometimes you slip and you trip up and you may do things that unintentionally are hurtful.
How many cases would you say APS typically responds to in a year? 
It’s always going to fluctuate, but I would say for this last fiscal year, we saw just a little bit over 6,400 APS investigations. I would say that’s an honest number from year-to-year. 
And one thing too that I want to emphasize is Adult Protective Services isn’t just elder adults. We are 18 and older, so our vulnerability population and the responses vary,  because you have to be reactive to the current situation. 
What kind of cases do you frequently see in New Mexico? 
As rural as New Mexico is, there’s a lot of isolation so a lot of self-neglect occurs and sometimes it’s unknowingly or knowingly.  
And exploitation, we’ve seen a huge increase just because scams are growing, the way they’re doing scams. We all get them, right?  It’s not specific to vulnerability. Everybody’s a potential victim. And when you are a vulnerable adult, that risk increases, so you see a lot of those tech scams. And then romance scams are another one.
What are the differences between abuse, neglect and exploitation?
Abuse is knowingly, intentionally and negligently inflicting physical pain or injury or mental anguish on a vulnerable adult. Signs of abuse come in various ways, and it’s not always the obvious black eye, broken nose. It could be scratches, small cuts or wounds, grab marks, certain bruises that aren’t always so obvious, any unexplainable injuries, bed sores. Some of the more kind of scary ones is physical confinement, sexual assault or any sort of verbal or psychological abuse.
Neglect – it’s the failure of the caretaker of an adult to provide the basic needs of an adult, such as food, shelter, supervision, the physical, mental health, in terms of the care that goes into that. Some signs of that are starvation, signs of dehydration, over- and under medicating an individual, unsanitary living environments. Things like hoarding, lack of personal hygiene or failure to go to specific medical care.
Exploitation is the unjust, improper use of an adult’s money or property for their own personal gain. So signs of exploitation [are] really the misuse or change in somebody’s money, income or property. We see this quite a bit with people transferring the deeds of family members’ homes because they’re incapacitated, which isn’t in the best interest of the client or part of any sort of legal document or process.
Now that you are in the role of director of APS, what changes or additions do you want to bring to your department?  
My goal is for us to continue to grow the program – to be proactive when it comes to behavioral health and substance use disorder. We continue to hear that there’s a growing concern [in these areas], and APS is very much in agreement that we are seeing that increase. My goal is to continue to promote the growth within the department…and that’s just by making sure that we’re staying up-to-date with the changes and what’s being reported by the state.
What draws you to this work and working with this population of New Mexicans?
I love New Mexico and I love being here, and I want everybody here to have that same experience that I have. I did have my grandparents who fell into that need for caregivers and my family stepped up wonderfully and was supportive. So I just want to make sure that everybody has that opportunity to age in place.
I think the most important thing is I want to be part of a program that’s going to maybe one day have to take care of me.  So I would like to make sure that I’m doing my very best to promote the success of this program.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/roybal-1024x472.jpeg,,,2025-07-04 09:03:35.531180

While heavy rains on Thursday threatened communities along the burn scars, Independence Day is forecast to be mostly sunny and hot for nearly all of New Mexico. More than 90% of the state is experiencing some level of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, with parched plants creating potential fire fuels.
NM Gov declares state of emergency for ongoing drought, fire risk

As of July 3, 12 New Mexico counties are under some level of fire restrictions, in addition to two towns — Cloudcroft and Ruidoso — and one tribal jurisdiction — Mescalero Apache. Eight of the counties are under burn bans that explicitly ban fireworks. Those counties are: Colfax, Lincoln, Luna, McKinley, Rio Arriba, Sierra, Torrance and Valencia.
So far this year, 531 confirmed wildfires have ignited in New Mexico, burning more than 140,000 acres, according to the Southwest Coordination Center. Of them, 345 were human-caused, 71 were naturally caused and 115 had “unknown” causes. Frequently, wildfires initially deemed “unknown” later turn out to be human-caused.
Fireworks are not allowed anywhere in National and State forests, National Parks and other public lands.
A 1996 law vests municipalities with the power to regulate fireworks, but only with 20 days notice and limited to certain kinds (listed as missile and stick-type rockets, helicopters, aerial spinners and ground-audible devices).
The City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County also banned aerials and devices that can be heard from the ground. All fireworks must be used on paved surfaces, with a nearby bucket to extinguish any errant sparks and cannot be discharged in the Bosque, open space areas or city parks.
Colfax and Otero counties banned firework sales determining the dry and hot conditions posed too high a fire risk.
Santa Fe County enacted a fireworks ban last month through July 10. “This fireworks ban is a preventive measure to protect lives, property, and the environment,” Santa Fe County Fire Marshal Jaome Blay said in a statement. “We urge all residents to avoid personal use of fireworks and instead attend professionally produced public displays.”

As a refugee, I bought this flag not because America is perfect, but because of its promise.
The first time I saw the American flag, I was nine years old. My family and I were at the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, preparing to return to Afghanistan after years of fleeing the Taliban and living in exile. 
We waited to be vaccinated and processed for return, and the American flag was attached to the back of a U.S. Army vehicle. My uncle, pointing at the flag, said, “Look, now we will be safe.” At that moment, the American flag felt like a promise. 
Since then, the flag’s meaning has shifted, but I refuse to let hate define it.
Years later, I was granted a student visa and arrived in the United States as an international student. In the airport, I stood again in front of the American flag, where it waved its thirteen red and white stripes and fifty stars. It was a profound moment when I felt welcomed. I knew then, deep in my heart, that I was safe and my life was full of possibilities. 
As I experienced America and life in it, that sense of safety changed. Slowly, I began to fear the flag that once gave me hope.
I saw the American flag in the hands of people shouting vulgar things about immigrants. I saw it on t-shirts worn by those who looked at me with hate. I started to believe that when an American flag was hanging on someone’s porch or painted on their truck, it meant I wasn’t welcome. The flag that once symbolized safety and freedom slowly started to feel like a warning.
But, a few days ago, I found myself revisiting the most joyful moments of my life in this country: arriving in the U.S. for the first time, the day I became a U.S. citizen, my siblings making it to America safely, and my mother stepping off a plane onto American soil. 
In every photo from those moments, we are smiling—some of us crying—with the American flag waving in the background. Despite everything, that flag was always there, not just in fear, but in celebration of survival and homecoming.
This Independence Day, I bought an American flag.
I do not believe this country is perfect, but I believe we belong in it. I know we are part of America’s flawed, painful, and beautiful story. I bought the flag because we, too, arrived here with teary eyes and hopeful hearts. Like that little girl at the border all those years ago, I still choose to believe in the promise of safety, dignity, and a better life.
But belief alone is not enough. We must act.
When you turn on the news or scroll through social media, the stories are grim. The Trump administration continues to sow fear and division. In states where refugees are revitalizing communities, federal policies are stripping refugee resettlement while programs have been indefinitely paused. Funding cuts have gutted resettlement and legal support systems. Fundamental rights, such as asylum and due process, are under constant attack. Families are being separated. People from entire countries are once again banned from entering America. Refugee and immigrant rights organizations are being systematically targeted. 
Last year, 625 refugees found safety in Maine, bringing their resilience, vibrancy, and skills to a state facing an aging population and labor shortages. Maine’s essential refugee agencies are now grappling with how to preserve basic services after federal funding cuts gutted their support systems. These actions are a cowardly way to treat people who have crossed continents and oceans, left everything behind, and risked it all to come home.
For many of us, America was not our first choice. However, it is our last hope. And still, we love this country not because it’s easy, but because we’ve invested our futures in its promises and potential. Refugees know that we are not just part of America—we help make it whole.
As we step into a new chapter of American history, the flag belongs to us all. The flag, and the country for which it stands, belongs to those who believe in something better, kinder, and in the promise of liberty and justice for all. It belongs to everyone who dares to hope, who fights for compassion, and who still—despite everything—believes in its promise. This flag is our flag.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.

Clyde Kennard — railroaded in 1960 because he dared to try to enroll at an all-white college in Mississippi — died of cancer just months after being freed from prison. He died on the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which promised “all men are created equal.” 
After World War II ended, Kennard taught denazification classes to German students. Years later, he served as a paratrooper in the Korean War. Afterward, he attended the University of Chicago, where he worked on a political science degree, only to have to return home to help his mother after his stepfather died. 
He started a chicken farm to help her make ends meet and tried to finish his degree by applying to attend the nearby college, now known as the University of Southern Mississippi. 
The State Sovereignty Commission, headed by the governor, used Black leaders to try and dissuade Kennard from enrolling at the all-white college. When that failed, there was a plot to plant a bomb in the Mercury car he drove. 
On Dec. 6, 1958, he wrote a letter to the editor of the Hattiesburg American, questioning the logic of the “separate but equal” approach: “After our paralleled graduate schools, where do our parallels of separate but equal go? Are we to assume that paralleled hospitals are to be built for the two groups of doctors? Are we to build two bridges across the same stream in order to give equal opportunities to both groups of engineers? Are we to have two courts of law so as to give both groups of lawyers the same chance to demonstrate their skills; two legislatures for our politically inclined, and of course two governors?” 
Months later, when he attempted to enroll at the college, constables claimed they found whiskey under the seat of his car, despite the fact he was a teetotaler. When he continued his fight to attend, he was arrested on charges, this time for reportedly stealing chicken feed. 
Kennard went to Parchman prison, where he was forced to pick cotton from daylight to dark. In 1961, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, but wasn’t released from prison until two years later, just months before he died. 
In 2005, the man who testified against Kennard admitted that Kennard had done nothing illegal. A year later, a judge tossed out Kennard’s conviction, clearing his name for good. A new book by Devery Anderson details Kennard’s life and what Anderson calls a “slow, calculated lynching.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102336/July4-FeatImage-Clyde-Kennard-book.jpg,,,2025-07-04 09:03:35.531180
,California,2025-07-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s politics drifts rightward while New York’s leans left,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/california-politics-new-york-leans-left/,"In contrast to New York voters favoring a ""democratic socialist,"" Californians chose moderate politicians like Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie.","The Democratic Party’s eight months of internal debate, recriminations and soul searching that followed Donald Trump’s win and Kamala Harris’ loss in last year’s presidential duel got another jolt last month, when an otherwise obscure 33-year-old state legislator finished first in New York City’s mayoral primary.
Many Democratic leaders have concluded that Trump’s win was rooted in the image of their party reflecting priorities of college-educated coastal elitists rather than everyday issues affecting blue-collar families, such as inflation, crime and immigration.
The remedy, many concluded, lies in turning a bit to the right, downplaying such issues as climate change and paying more attention to bread-and-butter concerns.
However, the surprise primary win in New York by declared “democratic socialist” Zohran Mamdani, making him the favorite to become mayor of the nation’s largest city, creates a new wrinkle in the Democrats’ post-election debate.
Mamdani stressed the cost of living and other working class issues, promising that if elected he would make life easier for New Yorkers. He’s advocated for rent freezes, increases in minimum wages and having the city open its own grocery stores to drive down food costs.
Mamdani’s emergence as a new party leader with a pronounced left-of-center campaign resonates a continent away in California, a one-party state whose dominant Democrats are often divided along ideological lines, pitting Mamdani-like progressives against business-oriented moderates.
In the main, progressives have been losing ground to the mods, even in the San Francisco Bay Area, the bluest region in a deep-blue state. Daniel Lurie’s recent election as mayor of San Francisco, on pledges to balance the city’s deficit-ridden budget and crack down on street crime, is one indication of that trend. The recall or rejection of other Bay Area progressive officeholders in recent elections is another.
As the political website Politico noted recently, “Zohran Mamdani’s rise in New York enraptured progressives across the country. But for activists in San Francisco, it’s a sobering reminder of just how far they’ve fallen in this onetime bastion of progressivism.”
The conflict is also very evident in the state Capitol, with the political arc of Gov. Gavin Newsom a pithy example.
While running for governor in 2018 Newsom — the former mayor of San Francisco — paddled his political canoe to the left, embracing such leftist iconic causes as single-payer health care.
However, over the next six years Newsom slowly drifted rightward in policy terms, calling for tougher attitudes toward encampments of homeless people, dispatching Highway Patrol officers to fight street crime and, most recently, opposing transgender women competing in women’s sports.
Newsom even dropped his advocacy of single-payer health care in favor of wider coverage by the state’s Medi-Cal program, then sought to cut back on that coverage to close a state budget deficit this year.
As Newsom distanced himself from the progressive agenda — perhaps to make himself more viable as a presidential candidate in 2028 — its advocates found that the Legislature became less amenable as well. Progressive agenda bills could often gain passage in one legislative house only to die, almost always without any formal votes, in the other house.
Last year’s election also indicated that while California is a blue state, it’s nowhere close to embracing the democratic socialist program. Not only did Trump do surprisingly well against Kamala Harris in California’s presidential voting, but voters passed Proposition 36, an anti-crime measure that most Democratic leaders, including Newsom, opposed as a regression from criminal justice reforms.
This week’s passage of two Newsom-backed bills to overhaul the California Environmental Quality Act over the opposition of major environmental groups was another indication that, if anything, California’s politics are drifting slowly rightward.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/082024_CA-Dem_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-04 08:00:37.129473

Clyde Kennard — railroaded in 1960 because he dared to try to enroll at an all-white college in Mississippi — died of cancer just months after being freed from prison. He died on the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which promised “all men are created equal.” 
After World War II ended, Kennard taught denazification classes to German students. Years later, he served as a paratrooper in the Korean War. Afterward, he attended the University of Chicago, where he worked on a political science degree, only to have to return home to help his mother after his stepfather died. 
He started a chicken farm to help her make ends meet and tried to finish his degree by applying to attend the nearby college, now known as the University of Southern Mississippi. 
The State Sovereignty Commission, headed by the governor, used Black leaders to try and dissuade Kennard from enrolling at the all-white college. When that failed, there was a plot to plant a bomb in the Mercury car he drove. 
On Dec. 6, 1958, he wrote a letter to the editor of the Hattiesburg American, questioning the logic of the “separate but equal” approach: “After our paralleled graduate schools, where do our parallels of separate but equal go? Are we to assume that paralleled hospitals are to be built for the two groups of doctors? Are we to build two bridges across the same stream in order to give equal opportunities to both groups of engineers? Are we to have two courts of law so as to give both groups of lawyers the same chance to demonstrate their skills; two legislatures for our politically inclined, and of course two governors?” 
Months later, when he attempted to enroll at the college, constables claimed they found whiskey under the seat of his car, despite the fact he was a teetotaler. When he continued his fight to attend, he was arrested on charges, this time for reportedly stealing chicken feed. 
Kennard went to Parchman prison, where he was forced to pick cotton from daylight to dark. In 1961, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, but wasn’t released from prison until two years later, just months before he died. 
In 2005, the man who testified against Kennard admitted that Kennard had done nothing illegal. A year later, a judge tossed out Kennard’s conviction, clearing his name for good. A new book by Devery Anderson details Kennard’s life and what Anderson calls a “slow, calculated lynching.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102336/July4-FeatImage-Clyde-Kennard-book.jpg,,,2025-07-04 11:04:23.716928

Credit: National Archives.Editor’s note: With all the political division confronting Americans these days, we at the Phoenix thought it right to look to our roots as a country. To that end, we’re republishing one of our charter documents, the Declaration of Independence. Happy Fourth of July!
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience has shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

 Refusal to enact needed laws

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature; a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;
  The U.S. Supreme Court (Susan J. Demas illustration)
 Mock trials

For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;
For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;
For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses;

For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;
For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments;
For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

 Exciting domestic insurrections

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.
In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brissia Hernandez and Heidi Perez: Students like us will finally be able to go to college in the state.","This commentary is by Brissia Hernandez of Enosburg and Heidi Perez of Milton, members of Migrant Justice who have recently graduated from high school. Heidi Perez is currently in immigration detention after being detained by Border Patrol.


Going to high school in Vermont is really hard when you don’t speak English. We both moved here a couple of years ago to be with our families. We had to leave behind everything that we knew and start completely over: new classes, new friends, new language, new country. 
Everything here is very different. People judge you for being an immigrant. We both got lost on the way to class at first, and it was really hard to ask for help. It all makes you feel so alone. At first, they don’t even put you in classes with other students.
But finally, with an interpreter to help, we could start going to normal classes, although it was only in Spanish class that we could talk normally. And now that a few more immigrant students are coming to our schools, we at least have some other classmates who understand. 
When we first moved to Vermont, there was basically no hope for students like us to go to college, even though we have been dreaming of it since we were little. College helps you grow as a person and learn so many new things. It gets you ready to help other people and support your community. It helps you get over your fears and be a better person. It helps you become someone important. 
Our parents came to this country and work hard every day to fight for a better life for us. But college is really expensive. It wasn’t until last year that we could really hope to make our dreams of going to college come true. Last January, a group of immigrant activists called Migrant Justice started going to the Statehouse to talk with legislators about making college more accessible for students like us. 
We both got involved because our moms are community leaders with Migrant Justice. It was weird at first to be there. From the outside, the Statehouse looks like a big castle. But we knew how important it was to be there.
Together, we explained the discrimination that we face and also the dreams that we have. We even talked to reporters and gave interviews that got played on TV. Even though it made us nervous to be in front of so many cameras, we shared our stories because it’s important that our community and our voices are heard. 
And we won! Last May, the bill that we fought so hard to pass got signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott. On July 1, 2025, it finally went into effect.
Students like us will finally be able to go to college in the state. We’ll be treated like any other Vermonter and pay the same in-state tuition rates. We will be able to get the same scholarships to help pay for college. These changes will let us go to college in Vermont, close to our families, instead of being separated again. 
We still don’t know what we want to be when we grow up. Maybe a dentist. Maybe an architect. Maybe organizers like our moms. Or maybe a plastic surgeon like on Brissia’s favorite TV show. But now we have the chance to find out.

Advocates hope the heat-related death of a worker in Madison last year will spur them to action this fall. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Days after a record-breaking heat wave in New Jersey, the Legislature recessed for the summer without moving legislation that would mandate protections for workers who spend hours outdoors in the blistering heat. 
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), who has sponsored a version of the measure since 2023, said he’s aggravated at the uphill battle this controversial bill has faced when he believes it’s “common sense.” 
“Everybody knows that we just had two of the hottest days in years. We look at people working outside while we drive and say, ‘Wow, look at that, that’s something I don’t want to be doing.’ But yet, we don’t care enough to provide the standards that they need and deserve,” Cryan said. 
His latest proposal would require employers to develop heat-related illness and injury prevention plans, and mandate the state labor commissioner to create heat stress levels that trigger those plans. Employers would be required to regularly monitor workers for exposure to heat, provide cool water, cool-down areas and paid rest breaks, limit the time employees are out in the heat during the workday, postpone non-essential tasks, and limit exposure to work in sources of heat. 
Prevention plans also would have to include annual training for employees working in the heat, along with record-keeping requirements and emergency response procedures, according to the bill. The Labor Department could issue stop-work orders for employers who don’t comply with the bill’s provisions, and fine businesses $2,000 for each day they violate the stop-work order.   
The bill, introduced in November, has not been scheduled for a hearing in the Senate. The Assembly’s companion bill also awaits a hearing in that chamber’s appropriations committee.
After another year of the legislation languishing, Cryan is mulling introducing yet another version, in hopes of garnering more support from business groups who have vehemently opposed the legislation. Provisions in previous bills he considered straightforward have become an odyssey, he said, with critics targeting the temperature of water or shade requirements.  
The New Jersey Business and Industry Association has testified against several iterations of the bill, saying the requirements would be onerous to businesses that already maintain effective work safety plans. 
“Our members have found that it would be extraordinarily difficult for them to comply with this legislation given its sheer impracticality, vagueness, costs, and industrial workplace-oriented standards that do not fit the needs of all businesses and clearly makes New Jersey an outlier regarding this new overly burdensome mandate,” Elissa Frank, the association’s vice president of government affairs, told the Assembly Labor Committee during a February hearing. 
As lawmakers stall, Garrett O’Connor of Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant labor advocacy group, noted that a federal agency recently confirmed the heat-related death of a New Jersey worker last summer. 
“Advocates for a workplace heat standard had said that over and over again, had made it clear, that a delay in getting workers protected would be deadly, and that’s exactly what we saw,” O’Connor said. 
According to an OSHA report, the 49-year-old worker was pouring concrete in Madison on July 8, 2024, when he began to “experience symptoms of heat stress and exhaustion due to high environmental temperatures” and collapsed. The National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory that day, with temperatures up to 97 degrees forecasted. 
He was taken to a local hospital, where he died, according to the OSHA report.










Advocates for a workplace heat standard had said that over and over again, had made it clear, that a delay in getting workers protected would be deadly, and that’s exactly what we saw.


– Garrett O'Connor of Make the Road New Jersey


The employer was fined $5,000 following an “informal settlement.” The citation states that employees were exposed to “high ambient heat” and “aggravating factors including an estimated moderate workload level.”
In 2022, three Amazon employees died at warehouses across the state — with at least one death occurred during a heat wave. The company denied heat played a role in their deaths.
As many as 170,000 workers fall victim to heat-stress incidents nationwide annually, according to consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Lower-wage workers are five times more likely to face heat-related injuries, and farmworkers face up to 35 times higher risk of dying from heat exposure than the rest of the U.S. workforce, the group said in a 2023 study.
O’Connor hopes that OSHA’s determination that heat contributed to last year’s death of the worker in Madison will move legislators to act on Cryan’s bill after they return to Trenton in the fall. 
States like California, Oregon, Washington and Minnesota have passed laws to protect workers from extreme heat, O’Connor pointed out. 
“There’s been this big misunderstanding with legislators that the sky is falling, but those predictions from opponents have not proven to be true elsewhere,” he said.

When land management decisions about trail development are being made in our towns, we humans need to choose reality over wishful thinking.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nancy Zimny: Recreational trails affect nature and wildlife.","This commentary is by Nancy Zimny of Richmond.


What Vermonter has not enjoyed the thrill of a fast downhill ski run, the adrenalin of a mountain bike turn, the wonderful exhaustion after a long hike or cross-country ski, the quiet pleasure of a walk in the woods or the “awesomeness” of the view from a mountaintop? Outdoor recreation feeds our spirit, strengthens our bodies, often supports the local economy, and therefore has exploded in popularity.
Consequently, Vermont communities face pressure to provide more access to more land to accommodate more outdoor recreation opportunities. And providing human access for outdoor recreation usually means trails.
Because the effects of recreation trail traffic on wildlife and nature are often more subtle and indirect, and not as immediately visible to the human eye as other activities like housing, logging or road construction, recreational trails may seem to have relatively little environmental impact, promoting conservation over development — a “win-win” situation: good for us and good for nature.
Is our human use of recreational trails as benign or beneficial as many outdoor recreationists, the public and even some land stewards seem to believe? This attractive premise is accepted readily as true, and the underlying “win-win” assumption is so ubiquitous that few question its validity. 
But scientific concerns about the impact of recreational trails on wildlife and natural habits have existed since the 1980s. Trails essentially provide a gateway for what are called cumulative effects to occur. These are persistent, repetitive, seemingly inconsequential — but ultimately negative — stresses on wildlife and nature caused by a high volume of recreational traffic. And these effects can occur well beyond the physical trail itself — in zones of influence that surround the trail. 
Trails have various possible effects. Habitats fragmented by recreational activity can disturb key animal movement patterns. Human presence alone can affect where and how wildlife live, forage and procreate by inducing repetitive flushing and flight behaviors. This imposes an increase in energy demands that increases animals’ stress and mortality — especially if it occurs during winter or other periods of limited food — and may decrease nest fidelity, or drive habitat abandonment.
Behavioral alterations associated with breeding and prey-predator relationships in plant and animal species can occur. Ultimately, species fitness, sustainability and diversity are compromised.
We use recreational trails in a variety of ways — walking, running, hiking, skiing or biking. Some behaviors. such as having dogs on or off leash, loud sounds, hikers cutting switchbacks, or bikers creating rogue trails, are likely to exacerbate problems. But even well-behaved trail recreationists can’t negate the conservation impact of repetitive high-volume use, and newer recreation technology that may further stress wildlife and nature.
No type of outdoor recreation can escape its responsibility in producing trail-based effects on conservation. However, the exponential rise in mountain biking draws particular attention to its role. Its popularity alone drives an intensive push for more trails to accommodate growing numbers of participants, and since bicycles allow people to go farther into the land’s interior, any negative effects on conservation are spread more broadly, potentially extending into areas that used to otherwise provide safe refuge for wildlife from human activity.
Furthermore, characteristics that humans consider highly desirable in mountain biking, such as separate trails for ascent and descent, loops, maximizing variety and technical challenges, and inter-connectivity of trails to form extensive networks, are all ancillary features that expand the human footprint and its effects on wildlife and habitat.
The call for “sustainable” trail-building within the mountain biking community is directed primarily at issues of soil erosion and water drainage — a laudable nod to conservation of the trails themselves — but these efforts alone do little to minimize the human impact on wildlife and habitat that more “sustainable” trails still invoke.
Many outdoor recreationists likely consider themselves conservationists. However, given the constellation of positive health, pleasure and economic factors that drive the popularity of outdoor recreation today, it is not surprising that any recreation trail-based concerns about impact on wildlife and habitat — even though known for many years — have gained little traction in the minds of outdoor recreationists or the public.
Attention to human impact of recreation trails on wildlife and habitat is growing. Studying it presents some logistical and scientific challenges. Still, just because we don’t know everything, doesn’t mean we know nothing.
In systematic literature reviews of the impact of recreation on wildlife, most show a generally negative effect that includes impact not only on well-recognized mammals, but also insects, herpetofauna, and birds.
Other studies reveal the negative effect of human presence on wildlife is potentially stronger, more widespread, or serious than humans are aware of or are willing to believe, and that human interpretation of wildlife behavior can be fraught with inaccuracy. Certainly, enough information already exists to warrant significant skepticism that trail-based recreation is either innocuous or benign.
Trail-based recreation benefits humans. But when land management decisions about trail development are being made in our towns, we humans need to choose reality over wishful thinking. We need to be mindful of the potential impact our personal outdoor recreational activities have on nature and wildlife habitats, and stay wary of the power of our anthropocentric beliefs that may lead us to ignore or dismiss scientific knowledge about what nature truly needs.
If we cannot be honest, humble or smart enough to do so, we risk making a dangerous Faustian bargain that may have enormous human appeal in the short term, but over time, will inevitably reveal itself as a very bad deal for nature and us.

Editor’s note: Below are some excerpts from a speech on the meaning of the Fourth of July delivered by Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York, July 5, 1852. 
Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?
Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful.
…But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. — The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me… This Fourth of July is yours, not mine…
…My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave’s point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery — the great sin and shame of America! “I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;” I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.
But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light?
…At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.
What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.
…The church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.
For my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throng of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that “pure and undefiled religion” which is from above, and which is “first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man…
Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation — a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a threepenny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe “that, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,” and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you “hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;” and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, “is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,” a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.
Fellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a bye-word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it…
…Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. “The arm of the Lord is not shortened,” and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic, are distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, “Let there be Light,” has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light…",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/frederick-douglass-696x523-1.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

First, do no harm.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  8 Vermonters: A plea from rural Vermont — our education system Is not the enemy.","This commentary is by Seth and Kate Leach of Pawlet, Hanna Fay of Pawlet, Shawn and Sara Gingue of Waterford, Jeremy Russo of Rupert, and Christopher Smid and Hilary Solomon of Middletown Springs.


For the past year (and more), we have watched while Vermonters concerned about the cost and quality of education have debated the knotty issue of education finance reform. We have been saddened to see various groups (such as the Friends of Vermont Public Education) leverage this important public debate as an opportunity to attack our unique education system and our local independent schools. These efforts do nothing other than take educational opportunities away from our kids in rural communities like ours.
With the passage of H.454, we hope that all Vermonters — including those of us in the communities historically served by independent schools—can recognize that our leaders in Montpelier may have come up with a cure that isn’t worse than the disease. One that encourages efficiencies that don’t come at the cost of excellence and equity, and that does not “fix” our state’s education affordability crisis by requiring areas like ours to spend money we don’t have on new schools we don’t need.

In a line that runs diagonally from Bennington County in the southwest all the way up to the Northeast Kingdom, independent schools have stepped in, not to compete with public schools, but to fill gaps in the public system.
These independent schools have pioneered programs to support students living in poverty, and offer alternative paths to graduation for kids who might otherwise drop out. They have strong anti-discrimination policies, restorative justice practices that keep kids in school and high academic standards that prepare students for the futures they want to build.
All that for kids, like ours, from families who wouldn’t dream of trying to find five figures a year to pay elementary or high school tuition. Our children have incredible learning opportunities — nurturing teachers, AP classes, internships, travel opportunities, International Baccalaureate classes — because our tax dollars go to these independent schools, most of which raise money themselves to make up the difference and pay for the buildings and tools they need to teach.
To be clear, we’re not talking about a “voucher” system, taking dollars from existing public schools — we’re talking about town tuition going to approved independent schools where public school grades don’t exist. 
We literally didn’t build the public schools that our independent schools are supposedly competing with unfairly; we didn’t need to. We don’t want to now. Why spend tens of millions of dollars duplicating resources we already have, especially when the crisis Vermont education is facing is a fiscal one? 
There is no question that Vermont’s school funding model has been in dire need of reform, and we support the notion of more efficient administration, and even the painful truth that some schools may have to close. But there is no reason to target independent schools that have stepped in to fill an educational void for our students in rural Vermont, and have done so cost-effectively and incredibly well. 
The framework agreed upon is a starting point, and the devil is always in the details; clearly, the process of designing the new districts will be yet another opportunity for those who don’t understand these independent schools to try to eliminate them. But in this moment, we are incredibly grateful to all those in the state house who stayed focused on the real financial issues facing our entire system, and were unwilling to scapegoat the incredible schools that serve our kids with misinformation and rhetoric that simply does not align with the facts.
To everyone who’ll have a hand in this process going forward, please just remember the immortal advice of the great teacher Hippoccrates: first, do no harm.

(Washington State Parks)Though Washington State Parks, like other parts of state government, did not make it through this year’s legislative session with its budget unscathed, park visitors shouldn’t notice any staffing or service changes this summer, according to the agency. 
“We were fairly fortunate in that we were able to make mostly non-staffing cuts to be able to stay within budget,” said Sarah Fronk, a State Parks spokesperson. 
The agency’s operating budget for the 2025-27 biennium is $257.6 million, about $14.7 million less than its budget for the 2023-25 biennium. 
State Parks cut nine vacant positions and made other reductions, such as limiting staff travel, to stay within its tighter budget. 
“It’s really being extremely mindful of where we’re spending and what our priorities are,” Fronk said of managing the cuts, adding that maintaining safe and clean parks is the agency’s primary focus. 
In addition to a smaller budget, State Parks is now expected to fund 71% of its costs with revenue from Discover Passes and other fees, up from 65% in the last budget cycle. 
Discover Pass prices will rise from $30 to $45 on Oct. 1. Transaction fees can also apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. The passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites.
The Legislature approved the Discover Pass price increase during last year’s session. It’s the first price increase since the passes were introduced about 14 years ago.
“We’re really grateful to the Legislature for having our backs and kicking a little more revenue support our way,” Fronk said. “With the Discover Pass, I really can’t reiterate enough that it really does go to support your state parks and the stewardship and recreation work that we’re doing, because so much of our agency’s revenue is dependent on those sales.” 
Washington State Parks manages about 123 developed parks, 6,000 campsites, 800 historic buildings and 1,300 miles of trails across 12,000 acres of land. 
State Parks’ busy summer season runs from Memorial Day weekend in May to Labor Day weekend in September. 
“We’re anticipating that there’ll be a lot of visitors to state parks this year, and so we’re definitely gearing up for that,” Fronk said. 
In an effort to support staff with a smaller budget, State Parks is bolstering its education programs “so that people coming into the park don’t need quite as much help, and we can stay focused on cleaning and doing interpretive work,” Fronk said. 
New this summer, State Parks has partnered with the Washington State Parks Foundation and the online education platform Fridie Outdoors to create an educational video series for park visitors. 
State Parks also has a variety of outdoor guides and other resources available on its website to help visitors build outdoor literacy. 
“I really believe that, once people get those experiences outdoors and understand more what they’re seeing around them, they’re going to be more excited and interested in helping protect that, as well,” Fronk said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ParadisePoint_Campground.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July cookout will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second-highest cookout cost since 2013, when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices. 
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
 Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say

Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president, said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one-pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

In the earliest days of the United States, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail about the celebration of independence, “It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.”
“Bonfires and illuminations” refer directly to what we know as pyrotechnics and firework displays.
I’m a chemist and also president of Pyrotechnics Guild International, an organization that promotes the safe use of fireworks and using them here in the U.S. to celebrate Independence Day and other festivals throughout the year. As a chemist, and someone who leads demonstrations for chemistry students, I consider fireworks a great example of combustion reactions that produce colored fire. But the invention of colored fireworks is relatively recent and not all colors are easy to produce.
Early history of fireworks

Firecrackers were first invented serendipitously by the Chinese in 200 B.C. But it wasn’t until one thousand years later that Chinese alchemists developed fireworks in 800 A.D. These early fireworks were mostly bright and noisy concoctions designed to scare evil spirits – not the colorful, controlled explosions we see today. Fast forward another millennium and the Italians figured out how to add color by introducing various elements to the flammable mix. Adding the element strontium to a color pyrotechnic mix produces a red flame; copper, blue; barium, green; and sodium for yellow.
Too much or too little of the chemicals make significant changes in the temperature and thus the wavelength of color seen. The proper mixture of chemicals when ignited produce enough energy to excite electrons to give off different colors of light.
Even though the chemistry of these colors isn’t new, each generation seems to get excited by the colors splashed across the sky. We now have a wide range of flame colors: red, green, blue, yellow, purple, and variations of these.
Each color works the same way. As different elements ignite they release different wavelengths of light which translate as different colors.
Making the perfect blue
Not all colors of fireworks are equally easy to create. I believe several of my colleagues in pyrotechnic research and development would agree with me that blue is the most difficult color to produce.

  Pill box blue is the trickiest color firework to produce. (Tom Handel, CC BY-SA)
That is because the evening sky is a shade of blue, which means that most blues do not show up as well. If you try to make the blue brighter to contrast with the background it can look washed out. The right balance of copper and other chemicals in the flame or combustion reaction produce the best blue color flame in a firework.
I have taken this into account when trying to create the best blue flame color, which I call pill box blue. It is just bright enough to stand out against the night sky but still a rich blue. I have over 20 blue pyrotechnic formulas and I have found one that comes very close to this elusive hue.
Another difficulty in creating an intense blue color is that the chemistry is not simple. It requires a combination of several chemicals and the element copper. When copper ignites, the electrons surrounding the copper atoms get excited and energized in the flame. When the electrons release this energy, it appears to observers as blue light. Each color works the same way. As different elements ignite they release different wavelengths of light which translate as different colors. So when you see blue-colored dots of light creating a pattern in the night sky, you really are seeing excited electrons releasing energy as blue light.

But it’s a different type of cow — the cash cow of an online school — that makes Union anything but a typical rural school district.
State legislators say they have put Union on the chopping block because of poor performance. But district leaders believe the real reason is so the state can reap the benefits of the Indiana Digital Learning School, a virtual school Union has overseen since 2017 — growing to 7,500 students and paying the district an estimated $3 million in oversight fees annually.
That school is now the latest battleground in a years-long controversy in Indiana and nationally over who should oversee and earn money from online schools and the millions in tax dollars flowing through them.
Citing poor test scores, Indiana’s state legislature voted in April to close the Union schools by 2027 and send its 300 students who attend classes in-person to neighboring districts miles away.
The online school would then be on its own and either shut down or bring its millions to another partner, either another district, the state or as a charter school.
Tucked into a major state tax reform bill as a last minute amendment, the legislature’s vote came as a surprise to the district, with no opportunity for debate.
Union is challenging the vote in court, saying it was singled out and that the legislature violated state law. Angry residents are defending the district, with even the electronic sign outside the Modoc United Methodist Church switching between listing service times and stating: “We Support Union School Strong!”

“I don’t know what to do,” said Danielle Baker, who has a son going into sixth grade in the fall. She called the vote “alarming” and is struggling to figure out where her son can finish school. “I feel helpless. So I’m just trying to put on a brave front, I guess, and just see what happens.”
Republican state representative J.D. Prescott, who called for the closure, said the move was necessary because Union has “some of the lowest reading scores in the state.”
But the district believes the real reason is the millions it receives from the INDLS, which is run by the publicly-traded virtual learning company Stride Learning, formerly known as K12 Inc.
“It has nothing to do with the school performance,” said Union Superintendent Galen Mast. “It has nothing to do with school size. It has everything to do with a greater plan that’s behind it.”
Union attracted statewide and national notice when it partnered with K12 in 2017 to start the online school as a way to boost dwindling enrollment and avoid bankruptcy. Private companies can’t just open a school and take in tax dollars for students who attend. So they need either the state or a school district to approve them to operate, or a designated agency known as an authorizer if they want to operate a charter school.
Union’s arrangement allows Stride/K12 to run the for-profit digital school as part of the district. In return, it gives Union 5% of the virtual school’s revenue, a huge bonus for a tiny district, especially now that the online school has grown dramatically.
Union school board president Christina Ogden said a state senator told her INDLS must close because the state wants to create its own online school. She and Mast said Prescott also told them the district could avoid being closed if it gave up its money from the digital school.
“I think they had to take out the one (online school) that had the most students first, and then it’ll be easier to go ahead and go around and close all of the others,” Ogden said. “The state wants to control those funds.”
She said Prescott withdrew the offer as soon as he found support in the legislature to pass his amendment that will close Union schools.
Mast also believes the vote was about the virtual school money.“We’re not the smallest school. We don’t have the worst results, but we are tied to NDLS,” Mast added.

The future of the online school is unclear, since it’s not even mentioned in the law. Stride/K12 declined to directly answer multiple questions from The 74 about its options, with spokesperson Brooke Gabbert saying it was too early to speculate. “Our priority is to ensure that Indiana Digital Learning School remains an option for families across the state,” Gabbert wrote in an email.
The Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association also objected to the legislature’s decision, saying the state should let small districts decide their own fate, not order changes, especially without debate.
“We’re just trying to figure out what is the threshold,” said Christopher Lagoni, the association’s executive director. “What is it that says ‘This is the standard for closure?’ Or is it an individual, case by case basis?”
“Everybody’s kind of in the dark on that,” he added.
Prescott did not respond to written questions from The 74 about whether he asked Union to give up the online school. He repeated concerns about Union’s test scores, though the state not giving districts grades each year since the pandemic makes comparing districts complicated.
“This amendment is about starting a conversation on how to better serve these students and ensure they have access to a quality education,” he wrote.
Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said the state isn’t planning an online school right now, but said the state education department will review Indiana’s entire online learning system next year. That review will look at all parts of online schools, including how many virtual schools Indiana should have, their funding and who can create or oversee them
“Everything,” is how Jenner described the review.
“The question is, what guardrails or flexibilities do we need to have in place to make sure we’re getting the outcomes that we need for kids,” Jenner said.

That review won’t be an easy one because multiple districts, including one involving an influential Indiana family, all have an interest in having online school money in their budgets.
Union and the Clarksville school districts are the only districts with statewide e-schools. Many other Indiana school districts have created or are exploring online schools that serve local students to bring in more money or to keep them from departing to other online schools.
There’s also a much broader debate nationally within the school choice community about overseeing online schools as a way to earn money.
That has flared up mostly with online charter schools, whose relationship with their authorizers is similar to Union’s with INLDS. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers has criticized what it called “perverse incentives” of organizations that are supposed to make sure online schools are doing a good job but are also making more and more money if schools grow, even with poor results.
Oversight fees for online schools have since been a major controversy in several states, including California where officials near San Diego have been criminally charged for lax oversight, even when receiving fees that far exceeded what it cost to oversee the schools.
Though NACSA isn’t using such strident language today, it recommends that authorizers be paid only what it costs to oversee the schools, not a percentage of revenue. It also recommends that school districts should not authorize statewide virtual schools — a parallel to what Union and Clarksville are doing. Instead school districts should only oversee virtual schools serving students in their area.
Indiana state officials also have little confidence in small districts overseeing large online schools after two virtual charter schools overseen by the 1,000-student Daleville school district were found in 2017 to be defrauding the state with inflated enrollment numbers. State and federal investigators have estimated the schools improperly received between $44 and $154 million and have pursued separate cases, both criminal and to recover money.
Most recently, the superintendent of the two schools pleaded guilty early this month to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud as part of the case. Efforts to recover money are still ongoing.

Scott Bess, a state school board member and founder of the Indiana Charter Innovation Center, said he believes online schools can work well, but local school boards aren’t prepared to oversee giant virtual schools run by companies like Stride worth $3.5 billion.
“I would never advocate for a local school district to partner with a virtual school operator to run a large virtual operation, because that’s not what that school district does,” said Bess. “The school districts are set up to be local, community driven.”
Applying that belief evenly, however, would put the state at odds with the Clarksville school district.
Clarksville also partners with Stride/K12 and the Indiana Gateway Digital School, is run by a family with political influence Union lacks. Clarksville’s superintendent Tina Bennett is the wife of Tony Bennett, the former state superintendent of Indiana and Florida. He was also an executive at Stride/K12 before retiring in March.
The Union School Corporation, which also includes a few other small towns, has long had a budget and enrollment problem. With few students and all separated by acres of crops, enrollment has always been low. And while it’s not quite a one-room schoolhouse it has one strip-mall style school building that houses district offices, its elementary school and combined junior/senior high school.
It has also almost shut down a few times.
The district has explored merging with other districts more than once, while the state has also debated ordering small districts to consolidate. Union’s future has been so uncertain, district officials and residents say, that parents have sometimes sent their children to other schools to avoid having to change schools later.
The partnership with K12, now Stride, changed that. The district added the online school as a district program, offering a few rooms in its offices as a base, in return for 5% of the e-school’s revenue.
The school isn’t a charter school, but the arrangement is similar to how online charter schools pay their authorizers, the non-profits that allow them to open as schools and then oversee them.
As the online school grew, the district’s budget improved and Mast, who just joined as superintendent a year ago, said the school uses the virtual school money to improve its facilities and special education classes.
Sarah McCord, the owner of the Modoc Diner down the street from the school campus, said she lives in a neighboring town but sends her two children to Union because it has small class sizes and helped her daughter with a learning disability improve rapidly.
“A lot of parents are choosing Union because of the attention that their children are getting without having to pay private school costs,” McCord said.
She believes Union is taking unfair criticism for test scores because parents are sending their children for personal attention and a chance to catch up. If they improve, but don’t score at grade level, McCord said, the district looks bad and is unfairly targeted.
“I think it’s an injustice,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nevada must now brace itself for the big and brutal impacts of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which he is expected to sign this holiday weekend.
The GOP-backed multitrillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package imposes steep cuts to Nevada’s biggest public safety nets, including Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democratic leaders, nonpartisan organizations, and even the Republican governor have expressed concern about the state’s ability to absorb the cuts.
The U.S. Senate and House largely passed the megabill on party lines. Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen and Reps. Susie Lee, Steven Horsford, and Dina Titus all voted against the bill and have actively spoken out against it. The Nevada congressional delegation’s sole Republican, Rep. Mark Amodei voted to pass the measure.
The latest economic projections for Nevada showed a dreary outlook, and state lawmakers have acknowledged they may not have the funds to fill gaps created by federal funding cuts. Many believe a special session to make cuts will be necessary.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, in a statement Wednesday after the Senate narrowly passed the bill 51-50, called the bill a “brazen attack on the vital support systems our communities rely on.”
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, in a statement Thursday after the House passed the final version of the bill 218-214, said the GOP-backed megabill will devastate Nevada hospitals and “could cause lifesaving care to disappear across the state.”
“And at a time when Nevadans are still struggling with the basic cost of living, it will also increase the cost of energy by cutting investments in new energy infrastructure,” she said. “This bill is wrong, it will hurt Nevadans, and Republicans should be ashamed to have supported it.”
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in a statement posted on social media dismissed “beltway talking heads” bickering over the bill and celebrated one minor component of the bill, Trump’s “no tax on tips” and overtime promise, calling it “a huge win for hardworking Nevadans.”
He said his office “continues to assess” the bill but that “Nevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to help secure our border.”
Prior to a House vote in May on an earlier version of the bill, the Republican Governors Association announced 20 governors had signed onto a letter offering “strong support” for the bill. Lombardo was noticeably absent among the list of governors praising the bill in that letter.
Lombardo in February also expressed concern about Medicaid cuts, writing in a letter to congressional leaders that an “abrupt reduction in federal funding would not only disrupt care for those who rely on Medicaid, but would also destabilize public and private healthcare providers, leading to workforce reductions, service limitations, and financial strain on already overburdened health care facilities.”
Some of the provisions Lombardo warned about were implemented in the bill.
 Medicaid

Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose about $590 million annually in federal Medicaid funding for the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Approximately 750,000 Nevadans, or about 20% of the total population, were covered by Medicaid in 2023. CBO estimates more than 114,500 Nevadans could lose coverage.
Medicaid expansion
The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in 2014 provided health coverage to thousands of Nevadans through additional federal funding, cutting the uninsured rate in half, from 22% in 2012 to 10% in 2024.
Under the bill, federal funding rates for these expansion enrollees will be cut from 90% to 60%, forcing Nevada to either come up with additional state funds or cut Medicaid in the state.
If Nevada maintains its current Medicaid expansion program despite cuts in federal funding, it will cost the state $2.92 billion over a seven-year period. If Nevada drops Medicaid expansion due to the added costs, an additional 132,000 Nevadans would lose health care coverage, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Medicaid already accounts for a significant portion of state spending. In 2023, Nevada spent $5.6 billion to fund state Medicaid expenditures, or approximately 30% of its entire budget.
Hospitals, health care providers warn Medicaid cuts will be felt by people not on Medicaid

Provider tax
The bill will reduce a tax private hospitals pay that is known as a “provider tax.” The tax helps fund Medicaid and allows the state to access additional federal matching dollars.
Under the bill, Nevada stands to lose around $212 million in provider tax funding annually, according to Nevada Hospital Association President Pat Kelly.
In response to concerns about the impact reductions in the provider tax rate would have on rural hospitals, the bill provides the Rural Hospital Stabilization Fund with $50 billion from 2028 through 2032 to help with a transition.
Two rural hospitals in Nevada are vulnerable to closure once that funding ends: Battle Mountain General Hospital in Lander County and Humboldt General Hospital in Humboldt County.
 Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)

Nevada could be required to cover millions in costs currently footed by the federal government under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, better known as SNAP.
Until now, the federal government has paid for all benefits and half of the administrative costs for the nutrition program. Starting in 2028, states will be required to pay 75% of administrative costs, and potentially up to 15% of the program’s costs as a penalty for miscalculating payments.
Under those cuts, Nevada could lose between $70 million to $170 million in federal funding annually.
States with an error rate of less than 6% would not be penalized. Nevada’s error rate was 5.94% in fiscal year 2024, meaning if the state slips slightly, it could be on the hook for 15% of program costs.
Last week, the county’s 23 Democratic governors warned their states would not be able to fully fund SNAP if the federal government shifted costs to states.
Republican state leaders have largely been silent on the issue. But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, recently vetoed a budget measure to fund the Summer EBT Program, which covers low-income children during summer break, citing the “significant uncertainty regarding federal matching rates for this and other similar programs.”
The GOP-backed megabill also raises the work requirement by ten years, to age 64, and ends the exemption for adults with dependent children. Under the bill, parents with children older than 14 are subject to the work requirement.
Some lawfully present immigrants, including asylees and refugees, will also be stripped from eligibility under the bill. 
All together, as many as 265,000 Nevadans are at risk of losing some or all of their SNAP benefits under the bill, according to D.C.-based think tank the Urban Institute.
 No tax on tips

‘Big Beautiful Bill’ mostly benefits Nevada’s wealthiest

The bill also incorporates Trump’s “no tax on tips” promise, which he first made during a campaign rally in June 2024 in Las Vegas. The bill allows tipped workers, like bartenders, to deduct the amount of their tips from their taxable income, up to $25,000.
The provision expires after 2028.
Politicians from both sides of the aisle quickly got the populist idea of “no tax on tips.” That group included Sen. Jacky Rosen, who sponsored a standalone bill with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to exempt tipped wages, and Rep. Steven Horsford, who proposed an amendment to make the “no tax on tips” deduction permanent rather.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 60% of households with tipped workers – about 2% of all households nationwide – would benefit from the tax cut. They also estimate those benefits would be modest: about $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.
 Gambling losses

In addition to broader objections to the bill, U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Steven Horsford both publicly criticized a minor provision in the bill that limits declarable losses for gamblers.
“Republicans quietly snuck a provision into their big ugly bill that hits Nevada’s gaming industry hard,” Horsford posted on social media. “Break even at the casino? You still owe the IRS. It is a direct hit to our economy and the workers who power it.”
Horsford on Thursday vowed to introduce legislation “to stop this before it hurts NV jobs.”
 Environment

The bill eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which is currently set at 30% of the cost of a new rooftop solar system and installation. The credits were slated to fall to 26% in 2033. Instead, the credit will expire on Dec. 31, 2025.
Clean energy advocates fear the solar rooftop industry will suffer as a result. 
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Nevadans claimed more than $137 million in credits for investments in residential electricity generation on their 2024 tax returns.
Nevada will also see less revenue from oil and gas companies leasing and developing public lands in the state after the bill rolled back several reforms passed under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Half of all revenue from royalty rates goes to the state where federal land is being leased for oil and gas drilling, helping fund state programs. Under the bill, those rates were reduced from nearly 17% to about 13%, costing Nevada additional revenue that could be invested back into the state.
Nevada Wildlife Federation Executive Director Russell Kuhlman in a statement called the drafters of those provisions “tone deaf.”
“As Nevada’s habitat and wildlife continues to decline across our state, the current administration seems willing to bend over backwards to help industry profit from our public lands before they prioritize providing clean air, water and access for all public land users,” he added.
 Immigration

How the megabill allows Trump to expand mass deportations, curb immigrant benefits

The bill allocates $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years, in alignment with Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations. For perspective, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 2024 budget was $9.6 billion, according to the American Immigration Council.
The increased funding includes $45 billion to construct detention centers, $59 billion to Customs and Border Protection, nearly $6.2 billion for border technology and surveillance, and $450 million to aid state and local cooperation with immigration enforcement.
The Nevada Immigrant Coalition in a statement prior to the final passage noted the bill makes “ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, even bigger than the FBI and with a larger budget for detention than the entire Federal Bureau of Prisons.”
Their statement continued, “Funding to feed hungry children and seniors is being cut, while increased for the separation of working families. This budget is not just numbers on a page, it’s a roadmap for cruelty.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2221730619-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

Getty ImagesOn this day 249 years ago –  July 4, 1776 – the 2nd Continental Congress approved the final draft of the Declaration of Independence , as a burgeoning nation sought to establish itself free from tyrannical one-man rule. 
And while most of the delegates didn’t actually sign the Declaration until Aug. 2, 1776, we celebrate the Fourth of July as the birth of our nation largely because that was the date that begins the document. 
Whatever the date, its essential truth remains worthy of reminding ourselves about today, namely the absolute (“inalienable”) right of any people to self-governance, and further, that the government they choose must derive its power from the consent of the governed. 
What many of us now take for granted was a radical notion in 1776, and frankly, remains so today.
So take a few moments today to read the text of that document and perhaps rekindle an appreciation for the fragility of the freedoms we enjoy.
——————-
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

“Overpriced apartment complexes” such as the proposed project can be particularly detrimental when there is a real need for affordable housing, said Kitty Cameron at the June 27 City Council meeting.

Neighbors who have long opposed a proposed housing project adjacent to the 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park in South Burlington are now appealing to the city’s elected board.
After their latest arguments opposing a 32-unit mixed housing project were dismissed by the Vermont Supreme Court last month, more than 290 residents have signed a petition calling on the City Council to buy back the 7-acre parcel or encourage landowner JAM Golf, LLC, to donate it back to the city.
The council has not discussed the project since the parcel at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road was created as part of a settlement with JAM Golf in 2015, according to James Marc Leas, an appellant and neighbor who has fought against development there.

“But now things have really changed in South Burlington because there wasn’t even a glimmer of thought that we would fill up CityCenter. … It was just a dirt road then,” he said, arguing the project would be better situated farther away from the nature park that has the “last remaining views of the Green Mountains from anywhere along Dorset Street in South Burlington.”
The project aims to build a mix of duplexes, single-story carriage homes and two-story single-family homes with roadway and utility access on the undeveloped 6.9-acre parcel, Benjamin Avery, president of construction and development at BlackRock Construction LLC, said at the time. 
BlackRock Construction won development review board approval to build on the land in 2021 and cleared the state’s Act 250 permit in 2022, but the state permit was soon appealed by a group of 125 neighbors and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting. 
It has been tied up in environmental court since, with more than 26 competing motions entered and ruled upon by the court. Last month, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in favor of the developer.

The petition filed by residents last week claims the proposed development will destroy the wide trail, obscure the last remaining views of the hills, endanger park wildlife, and, most notably, lead to disruptive drilling and blasting of the rock ledge.
“JAM Golf is a private company and should not be allowed to develop on preserved Nature Park Land for such destructive private purposes. It is morally wrong for it to do so, and it sets a dangerous precedent for all developers who see green spaces as potential sources of private income that can be taken from the public,” the petition stated.
The developer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The city acquired the 110-acre nature park in 1992. It consists of mixed forest, grasslands, shrublands, wetlands, about 2 miles of walking trails, a tree nursery and a 14-acre Wheeler Homestead area that includes community garden plots for rent. City planning documents have referred to it as “the green lungs of the City Center.”

The Wheeler parcel at 550 Park Road was created in 2017 as part of a settlement agreement between the city and James McDonald, who still owns the property through a limited liability corporation called JAM Golf. It is one of several developments approved in the original master plan for the Vermont National Country Club and golf course over 434 acres.
“Overpriced apartment complexes,” such as the proposed, can be particularly detrimental where there is a real need for affordable housing, said Kitty Cameron, one of a handful of residents who shared her views at the June 27 City Council meeting.
She said the impact would be devastating to the beauty and wildlife of the adjoining park that she and her partner visit daily. She is also concerned about how construction runoff could affect the fragile ecosystem there.
“There’s just so much to treasure in that space,” she said, urging the council to take a pause and really assess the long-term impact of the project.
Jeanne Zagursky, who presented the petition, said residents want to avoid creating a precedent of cutting up and developing portions of a nature park that’s supposed to be preserved in perpetuity.
The council accepted the petition last week and is considering an executive session July 7 “for the purposes of discussing the negotiation or securing of real estate purchase or lease options, and specifically the JAM Golf parcel,” according to the posted agenda.
With approvals in place for 550 Park Road, the property owner is now free to seek a zoning permit for site work, such as building the road and then building the homes, according to Paul Connor, director of planning and zoning for the city.
“We’ve not received any of those yet, so I don’t have a timeline,” he said. “But they could come whenever they’re ready.”
As City Center grows so does the need for this parkland to be preserved, said Leas, who likened the spot to New York City’s Central Park.
“Hundreds of residents think it’s worth a try,” he wrote in an email.

A lawsuit was filed against a Brattleboro police detective alleging he filed the wrong date of birth in a warrant, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of an innocent pregnant woman.

A federal lawsuit filed on Sunday alleges that a mistake in a warrant caused the unconstitutional arrest of a pregnant Vermont woman who shared the same name as the suspect in a case involving a death from heroin overdose.
Court documents allege that on July 13, 2022, Alicia Kelley, the plaintiff in the case, was arrested at her home in front of her children and parents by Orleans County Sheriff Jennifer Harlow and a deputy, based on a warrant incorrectly filed by the defendant, Brattleboro Det. Lt. Greg Eaton.
Kelley “became distraught, panicked, and was brought to tears,” according to the lawsuit filed by her attorney, Brian Marsicovetere, in the U.S. District Court of Vermont on June 30. “Her parents and children were home and observed the arrest,” becoming “very upset.” 
Kelley was then held overnight in Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, Vermont on a $25,000 bond. The Orleans County Sheriff’s department then “posted a statement containing the details of the arrest on social media, which was viewed by members of (Kelley’s) community,” according to the lawsuit.The circumstances leading to Kelley’s arrest began over four years earlier. 
On June 8, 2018, Brianna Radcliffe, 21, overdosed on heroin in the bathroom of a Dunkin’ Donuts in Brattleboro, dying a few days later in the hospital. 
Following Radcliffe’s death, Detective Greg Eaton began investigating the circumstances of her overdose. With the manager of the Dunkin’, Eaton reviewed the surveillance tapes of the heroin deal that would end Radcliffe’s life. According to court filing, the manager recognized the dealer in the footage as a former employee of his: Alicia Kelley.
On May 20, 2019, almost a year after Radcliffe’s death, Eaton applied for a warrant, charging Kelley with selling narcotics that resulted in death. 
But according to the lawsuit, Eaton allegedly identified the wrong Kelley in the warrant.
Court documents reveal that while the women share the same full name — Alicia Kelley — the two were born about half a year apart in 1988. The date of birth of the plaintiff is in the fall while the date of birth of the former Dunkin’ employee who allegedly sold the heroin is in the spring. 
When the Vermont Superior Court issued the warrant, plaintiff Kelley’s birth date was written on it, despite never having met Brianna Radcliffe, according to the complaint. 
In the complaint, her lawyer, Marsicovetere, alleges Eaton had access to information that would have clearly differentiated the women.
“No attempt was made to compare physical attributes based on Vermont DMV or other available state databases. The Defendant did not take any steps to confirm he correctly identified Alicia M. Kelley in the arrest warrant application,” court documents read.
Eaton, who is being represented by McNeil, Leddy & Sheahan, P.C. of Burlington, declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
At her arraignment, plaintiff Kelley pleaded not guilty. The judge reduced her bail to $10,000, which her parents paid with the help of a bondsman, according to the complaint. 
According to court documents, after the State of Vermont learned that the warrant contained the wrong birth date, the state “filed a motion in the Vermont Superior Court to vacate all of Plaintiff’s bail conditions,” and amended the warrant to contain the birth date for the Kelley who is actually suspected of plying Radcliffe with the fatal heroin dose. 
Plaintiff Kelley’s case against Eaton accuses him of unlawful seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees.

RUTLAND — On Friday afternoon, a woman in a red sedan waved and honked her horn as she pulled up to a stoplight in front of city hall, exciting a woman who held a sign reading “Honk 4 Kim.” The people gathered there were supporters of Kim Peters — and they were still making noise three months after the mayor put the longtime director of the city’s rec department on paid leave. 
Alaura McClallen, organizer of the group, recognized the driver as a fellow parent. She, like McClallen, sent her kids to a summer camp run by the recreation department. When the light turned green, other drivers sounded their horns, some pumping their fists out the window. 
It was the second demonstration of the week for the small group, and the most recent event in a long saga of controversy over the ousting of Kim Peters. 
After Rutland Mayor Mike Doenges’s reelection, he announced that he would not reappoint Peters as the city’s recreation superintendent this year, prompting a public outcry and confusion that has lasted for months.
In private, Doenges explained his decision to the city’s Board of Aldermen with claims that Peters didn’t do proper background checks of recreation department volunteers and employees, according to public records obtained by VTDigger. But Doenges hasn’t been forthcoming about that reason publicly. 
His statements to residents broadly cite his lack of trust in Peters, leaving many skeptical that he has a legitimate reason for forcing her out of the position. Now she remains on paid leave until the role is filled. 
With public disapproval simmering since March, the city’s Board of Aldermen recently sidestepped Doenges and voted to reappoint Peters on June 16. But soon after the city attorney said the vote was invalid — and officials are not on the same page about what happens next.

Background Checks
Back in January, the Rutland Herald published a story that revealed two volunteers for the rec department have criminal records. In the article, Peters said she conducts background checks on all employees and volunteers in the department, but admitted she was unaware of one criminal charge before being informed by the newspaper. 
Doenges sent a letter to Peters on March 18 stating she was “placed on administrative leave effective immediately,” according to public records obtained by VTDigger. She would be barred from city buildings and unable to discuss her leave, but would remain on the city’s payroll until the position was permanently filled, records show.
Members of the Board of Aldermen were notified of her leave that day but not offered any explanation, according to city emails obtained by VTDigger. Many board members said they were struck by the decision and caught off guard. Shortly after, Doenges appointed April Cioffi as acting superintendent of the city’s recreation department. 
“This has been a very difficult time for Kim Peters,” said Larry Cupoli, a member of the Board of Aldermen and part of the search committee to fill Peters’ role. “Frankly, she’s probably the best thing that’s ever happened to the city,” he added.
Peters declined to comment. 
Doenges also declined to comment on his interactions with Peters. He said city attorney Megan LaChance advised him not to speak publicly about personnel matters. 
“There was a trust relationship that was broken between myself and the superintendent,” Doenges said in an interview. 
But in a March executive session, a meeting closed to the public, Doenges explained his reasoning to board members. He wrote a speech for that meeting in which, public records show, he alleged Peters lied about the department’s practice of running background checks. Doenges read the speech to board members, he said. 
“I was directly and intentionally deceived,” wrote Doenges in bold, with “deceived” underlined. 
In that written speech, Doenges said that after reading the Rutland Herald article in January, he dug into the city’s records and found out Peters hadn’t been doing proper background checks. Doenges claims Peters lied both to the newspaper and to him a number of times, then tried to cover it up afterward. 
“That’s not following procedure — that’s scrambling to fix the appearance of one,” Doenges wrote. 
“Imagine your child is coached by someone who seems perfectly fine. But we, as a city, skipped a critical step; and didn’t run a proper background check. // That coach hurts your child. And then you find out it could have been prevented,” he wrote later on. 
The city is an institution that must keep children safe — and without background checks, children are at risk, Doenges said. In his speech, Doenges cited the oversight lapses of the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church, both institutions notorious for sexual abuse claims. 
VTDigger asked Doenges why he drew connections between those institutions and Rutland City. “It’s not based on anything,” Doenges said. The city is a trusted organization and officials have to “do our part at all times to make sure that we are taking care of the citizens that are in our care,” he said. 
In his written speech, Doenges said he refuses to be someone who looks the other way when child safety is neglected. “I imagined the worst-case scenarios — because that’s what the job requires,” Doenges wrote in his speech.
‘It still did not make any sense’ 
Even after Doenges’ explanation, many city officials said they couldn’t get behind his decision. 
“Some of us — most of us — didn’t buy it,” said Sharon Davis, who also sits on the Board of Aldermen, in a recent interview. “It still did not make any sense knowing Kim and the reputation she had.” 
On April 8, Peters reached out to Doenges and formally asked to be reappointed to her position, public records show. Then, on April 11, Peters emailed the city attorney to ask if she could communicate with city officials and recreation department employees — LaChance, the attorney, sent her a cease-and-desist letter, records show. 
That same day, Doenges published an op-ed in the Rutland Herald, stating that he didn’t reappoint Peters because he lacked trust in her. The op-ed never mentioned a specific concern related to background checks. 
McClallen, who organized the recent city hall demonstrations, thinks the whole dispute between Doenges and Peters feels personal. “It makes me sad,” she said.
“I never ever mistrusted her,” even after hearing Doenges’ concerns about background checks, McClallen said.
If McClallen had known Doenges wasn’t going to reappoint Peters, she said, she wouldn’t have voted for him. Dozens of other people have emailed city officials in the last few months urging them to reappoint Peters, according to public records obtained by VTDigger. 
In emails, some residents complain Doenges wasn’t more transparent with residents. Doenges thinks people are upset because they don’t have all the information about the situation, and advice from legal counsel has stopped him from sharing more, he said. 
A contested vote
Near the end of a June 16 Board of Aldermen meeting, member Paul Clifford made a motion to reappoint Kim Peters as recreation superintendent. He cited a section of the city charter that allows the board to make an appointment if the mayor doesn’t within 90 days. 
The council unanimously voted to suspend the rules to allow the motion, since it wasn’t on the agenda. After taking a short recess to review voting rules and talk to LaChance, the city’s attorney, the board members voted 7-3 in favor of reappointing Peters. Board President David Allaire was the last member to vote, casting his in favor of Peters’ reappointment. 
Doenges said that after the vote he called Peters and offered her the position. Then on June 18 LaChance sent board members a memo outlining a number of missteps in the voting procedure. 
Two of those missteps made the vote invalid, LaChance wrote. 
As board president, Allaire should’ve made the motion for reappointment and “since the nomination was not properly made, the vote is invalid,” LaChance wrote. The president also should not have voted, and “the vote was invalid because President Allaire could not vote on the motion,” she wrote. 
After receiving the memo from LaChance, Doenges called Peters and revoked the job offer, he said. 
Now some board members think the vote still stands. 
“The mayor can accept the fact that Kim Peters has been reappointed by seven members of the Board of Aldermen and move on,” said Davis, who voted to reappoint Peters. Otherwise, the mayor will have to take legal action, she said. 
Doenges said he was unsure what taking legal action might look like. “I’m proceeding as if the vote was invalid because that’s what my legal counsel has told us,” he said. 
Others have accepted LaChance’s legal interpretation and plan on working with Doenges to move forward. It would be possible for the Board of Aldermen to vote on the matter again, but some members think that move is unlikely.
The search committee to find a new superintendent is still active and ongoing, Doenges said. Clifford told VTDigger he decided to step down from the committee given all the fallout. 
Some have gotten sick of the controversy. “It’s not good for Rutland,” said Michael Talbott, a member of the Board of Aldermen who voted against Peters’ reappointment. 
City emails obtained by VTDigger show employees scrambling within the recreation department to fill Peters’ shoes, struggling with logistics and to find needed resources without contacting Kim. 
McClallen said that while she doesn’t like to be political, she thinks the majority of the town still supports Peters. 
The recreation department “needs a leader,” said McClallen that Friday in June in front of City Hall. 
“The only person equipped is Kim,” she said.

“I carry my child self around with me all the time,” Peterson said at talk at Montpelier's Kellogg-Hubbard Library in March. “A lot of people don’t remember how intensely they felt as children.”

This story by Tom Mckone was first published in The Bridge on June 18.
Katherine Paterson is sitting in her Montpelier living room, doing what she does best — telling stories. Unlike the fiction she writes for children and young people, she recalls a true story about a furious woman who confronted her at a meeting. 
“These books are not for children,” the woman said. “They’re too intense.”
But intensity and her refusal to write down to children are two qualities that have made Paterson a great writer. She has published more than 40 books, and she’s won even more awards than that, including two National Book Awards and two Newberry Medals. The Library of Congress named her a living legend, and she is one of only six Americans who have won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition given to an author or illustrator of children’s books.
In awarding Paterson the Children’s Literature Legacy Award, and in citing “Bridge to Terabithia” in particular, the American Library Association said, “Paterson’s unflinching yet redemptive treatment of tragedy and loss helped pave the way for ever more realistic writing for young people.”
“I received a letter from a teacher who enclosed the book report of ‘the bad boy’ in her class, who had read ‘The Great Gilly Hopkins,’” Paterson says. “He said, ‘This book is a miracle.’ Miss Paterson knows exactly how children feel.”
“I carry my child self around with me all the time,” she says. “A lot of people don’t remember how intensely they felt as children.”

Asked about her favorite Paterson book, Jane Knight, children’s book buyer at Bear Pond Books, selected the same book that the challenging student wrote about.
“Gilly was the first character in whom I could recognize myself — both my inner and outer selves,” Knight said, “someone who could be mean and crabby and full of great sorrow and longing, and also someone who could grow and change. Gilly gave me the agency and permission to be a whole human, warts and all.”
“The Day of the Pelican” and “Bread and Roses, Too,” are past Vermont Humanities Vermont Reads selections, and “Lyddie” and “Jacob Have I Loved” are perpetual favorites. However, the most popular remains, hands-down, “Bridge to Terabithia,” Paterson’s 1977 novel about two best friends, the imaginary world they create, and the tragedy one of them has to deal with.
The book has been translated into more than 25 languages, and the publishers have lost track of how many copies have been sold; Paterson says it’s “in the millions.” A 50th anniversary special edition is scheduled to come out in 2027.
During a talk at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in March, Paterson shared how the death of her son’s friend, who was killed by lightning, sparked the story.
“I was supposed to explain to my kid why his best friend had died,” she said. “I couldn’t explain it to myself — how such a terrible tragedy could happen to this bright, funny child. But I know a story has to make sense. I began to write this story to try to make sense out of something that made no sense to me.”

From China to Japan, and eventually to Vermont
Paterson’s parents — George Raymond Womeldorf and Mary Elizabeth (Goetchius) Womeldorf — were missionaries in China, and that’s where she was born, in 1932. Living in China for most of her first 8 ½ years and growing up bilingual, she was reading in English by the time she was four. She went to two seminaries and did missionary work in Japan. 
During a stretch back in the United States, she met her future husband, John Paterson, a minister. Years later he would take a position at a Barre church, and in 1986 they would become Vermonters. After his death in 2013, Paterson moved from the large house they had needed while raising their four children into a smaller place in Montpelier.
Paterson’s Christian faith has always been important to her and to her writing.
“If you’re a person of faith, it’s going to come out in your books somehow or other,” she says during our conversation in her living room. “You don’t put it in. It’s who you are that comes out on the page.”
For many years, “Bridge to Terabithia” was one of the most-often banned books. Those challenging the book objected to Paterson’s treatment of death, religion, and fantasy. Some said the portrayal of some religious families was disrespectful and that the use of the word, “lord,” outside of prayer was sacrilegious. She was accused of promoting secular humanism and atheism.
“People who banned my books were all my Christian brothers and sisters,” she says. “The problem is that they think what I should be doing is writing propaganda, and not a story. Stories are open-ended and there for the reader to interpret if there’s a lesson.”
She says banning her books is no longer a priority, since she is “straight and white,” and book banners now focus on people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.

Life experiences inspire stories
During our interview, she shares many stories, like how seeing a black-and-white photograph on the wall at the Old Labor Hall in Barre led to “Bread and Roses, Too,” the story of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, during which children were sent out of harm’s way to temporarily live with foster families in Barre.
She says that “Jacob Have I Loved,” which she wrote at a very difficult time in her life, is the book she is most proud of. She wrote it while her mother was dying, her husband was busy with a new job, and their four children were unhappy about a family move. They lived in a small house, so her writing space was an enclosed front porch which was “freezing in winter and boiling in summer.”
While she is grateful for the “richness” of having had loving parents, when she was growing up, she experienced “what it feels like to not have enough money to do the things many people around me were doing.”
Never speechless
At the beginning of Paterson’s memoir, “Stories of My Life,” her fellow writer and longtime friend Nancy Price Graff (who is also a regular columnist for The Bridge) wrote an introduction in which she tells how for many years she and Paterson had weekly lunches at the Wayside on the Barre-Montpelier Road.
“Over the course of our friendship,” she writes, “I have seen Katherine whoop with laughter and I have seen her cry. I have seen her playful, sad, wistful, tired, thoughtful, and most often hopeful and happy, which seems to be her natural disposition. But I have never seen her speechless. Every week there are more stories.”
During Paterson’s talk at the library, she said, “Writers now are much more in touch with children’s feelings, and much more appreciative of the intelligence of children.” What she didn’t mention is that worldwide, she is credited as one of the writers who made that happen.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

About 30 years ago the industry-spawned strategy of “collaboration” entered the policy arena to influence and neuter the “conservation movement” that was dedicated to protecting the rapidly disappearing old growth forests, native species, wild landscapes, and pristine, trout-filled rivers. 
The logging industry had already lost the so-called “timber wars,” having cut themselves out of a sustainable future.  Likewise, the environmental abuses by extractive industries had left Montana with an inordinate number of clearcuts, Superfund sites (including the largest in the nation), abandoned industrial facilities and mines leaking toxins such as cyanide, that required treatment in perpetuity. 
Industry strategists are anything but dumb.  They knew they were losing public support due to their track record of environmental destruction. So they came up with “collaboration,” where extractive industries would find “consensus” with conservationists — virtually guaranteeing they’d get at least half of what they wanted, if not more.  In Montana, that strategy was first implemented by Gov. Marc Racicot’s hand-picked “Consensus Council.”
Formerly, conservation groups had lauded their “grassroots” nature, since members were their primary source of funding.  But that changed as these groups began to receive millions of dollars from foundations that were more inclined to fund collaborators than hard-fighting conservation advocates.
As vast sums of foundation funding flowed into Montana, formerly small organizations like the Montana Wilderness Association bought multi-million dollar buildings and, rather ironically, as their staff size and “assets” exploded, their actual conservation victories dwindled.
They were joined by The Nature Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Trout Unlimited, Sierra Club, Mountain Mamas, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, and many others that adopted a “go along to get along” attitude with extractive industries, government land and water management agencies, and special interests as they collaborated to cut the dwindling conservation baby in half again and again and again while hiding behind the charade of supporting “access.”  
They refused to criticize Sen. Jon Tester for tossing science aside to set the horrific precedent of Congressionally delisting wolves from the Endangered Species Act protections using a rider on a defense spending bill.  Why?  Because he was running for re-election. 
As electoral politics crept in to influence dubious policy changes they supported expanding categorical exclusions from bedrock environmental laws that require government agencies to consider the consequences of their proposed actions — and significantly, to provide the public with the right to review, comment and object to those proposals.
They supported vast “landscape scale” deforestation proposals under highly ambiguous “emergency” declarations.  They lauded the “Good Neighbor Policy,” which allows state governments to determine the management of federal lands.  That resulted in Montana’s Gov. Steve Bullock, perhaps seeking votes for his Senate campaign, to declare a stunning five million acres of national forests needed emergency logging, thinning and burning.
But now, those appeasement chickens are coming home to roost. 
Last week, it was the repeal of the Roadless Rule that protected roadless lands.  This week, the Department of Agriculture issued new regulations that eliminate public notice before using vastly expanded categorical exclusions, eliminate public comments on environmental assessments and Forest Plan revisions while dumping the requirement to publish draft Environmental Impact Statements for public review and allowing the Forest Service to choose which regulations it wants to use for on-going projects.
As the disastrous policies of the national and state administrations escalate, the collaborators are now trapped in a losing web of their own weaving.  After all, they still have to maintain those expensive buildings and pay those bloated staffs.  To do so they continue to suckle greedily at the foundations’ collaboration teats — all while facetiously claiming they’re “fighting” for conservation of our last wild lands and waters.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Helena-logging-pic.jpg,,,2025-07-04 07:06:14.411317

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City leaders said they’re gearing up for and are excited about the expected economic boost to their businesses that the 2028 Olympics will bring to the region.
While Los Angeles was selected to host the 2028 Olympic games, their organizing committee tapped Oklahoma City to host seven medal events, including kayaking, canoe slalom and women’s softball.
Softball will be played at Devon Park, a state-of-the art complex featuring four fields in northeast Oklahoma City. The watersports will be held at Riversport Rapids in downtown Oklahoma City, an area that can manufacture its own rapids and currently serves as a U.S. Olympic and Paralympic training site.
Business leaders across the area expect the Olympic events will bring tourists from across the globe to the city, which will be a boon for their economic fortunes.
“I think there is a great possibility for the increase of business during the games with athletes and fans coming to OKC, we will definitely monitor the trends and prepare for an increase in business during this time, especially for our locations closer to downtown OKC,” said Randy Newberry, a general manager with A Good Egg Dining Group. Good Egg oversees restaurants such as Red PrimeSteak, Mexican Radio and Tucker’s Onion Burgers.
Keith Paul, A Good Egg Dining Group’s chief executive officer, said the games will be a chance to showcase not only the Olympic venues, but also the diversity of the area’s food culture.
“I think the games coming to OKC will be a great chance for our city and state to showcase to the world that we not only have world class facilities to host these events but we also have a great city with great people,” Paul said.
Michael Byrnes is leading the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber’s efforts to stage the events the city has been chosen to host.
“With the Los Angeles ’28 Olympic Games on the horizon, we expect Oklahoma City to welcome a significant number of visitors, which will create a positive economic impact for our community,” he said. “We anticipate a significant impact within the hospitality sector.”
He said the events will have “a long-lasting impact on our reputation for hosting world-class sports events and show people from across the globe how we invest in our community.”
Lincoln Park Golf Course neighbors Devon Park. While golf may not be a part of the events, officials expect their two courses could serve as an activity during downtime between games.
“We will try to be very open and welcoming to out of town guests,” said Aaron Kristopeit, the course’s golf director. “I guess make sure everything is done with our best foot forward, and the best curb appeal considering we are facing Devon Park.”

Blake Jackson, a guide and co-owner of Casper’s Ugly Bug Fly Shop, ties a carp-slaying pattern.
The post The art of the fly: Angler relishes the meditation and creation of tying appeared first on WyoFile .","Fish love bugs and small aquatic critters. 
Anglers like Blake Jackson love to trick them.
It’s not just the exhilarating strike and tugs, or landing the big one. It’s not just being away, on the water, stalking the seam. There’s another side of the equation.
Back home, or at work — the Ugly Bug Fly Shop and Crazy Rainbow Fly Fishing in downtown Casper — is a time to conspire. To be creative.
Jackson sits at a desk with a small vise and considers which bugs are hatching on the nearby North Platte. Midges in the morning. Pale morning duns until about 2 p.m., yellow sallies in the afternoon, caddis in the evenings. “It’s like a clock on the dial,” he says.
But Jackson doesn’t have North Platte trout on his mind today. He’s hankering to wrestle with a carp. The reservoirs south of town are full of ’em: hulking, prehistoric-looking things with large scales and a protruded mouth sprouting fleshy whiskers. Some regard carp as a “trash fish,” Jackson laments. “But when you’re catch-and-release fishing anyway, to catch a 20-pound fish on a fly rod is a riot. It’s pretty addictive.”
Carp love this hodge-podge version of a crawdad, according to angler Blake Jackson. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
He clamps a stout, size-8 hook in the vise and wraps the shank with dark thread. Next, he attaches black bead-chain eyes at the top to ensure the fly rides with the hook pointed up.
It’s the beginning of a hodge-podge sort of crawdad pattern. A custom creation Jackson has been perfecting. It shares the characteristics of a damselfly and dragonfly larva. “It looks enough like a lot of different food items, and they just eat it.”
He hasn’t picked a name for it yet.
He clips a tuft of black marabou, attaches it with a few wraps and trims it to just the right length. Jackson works with precision, cinching the materials with a half-hitch knot, grooming the marabou just so. It’s a meditation. Depending on the type of fly he’s tying, his mind wanders to the place he’ll fish it. He’s standing in his flat-bottom boat, slowly drifting a favorite pocket on Pathfinder Reservoir. The surface is still, and it’s hot. Carp love the heat, he says.

Typically, the tying ritual includes country music in the background. Sometimes it’s a “stupid” podcast — some random comedian talking, “something I don’t have to follow closely.”
Rubbery legs are added next, then he wraps a peacock collar behind the head, keeping it thin “so it’s wispy with some movement.” He makes a few final knots, a few final clips. He admires his no-name creation.
Tomorrow, it hits the water.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Delegates to the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia on the Fourth of July in 1776, issued a remarkable document, proclaiming the 13 colonies in America to be free from British control. Fifty-six delegates signed a Declaration of Independence, famously stating: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.”
Friction with Great Britain had been festering and growing for several years leading up to the split. A decade before the Declaration was signed, Benjamin Franklin had warned the Brits against using their troops to quell unrest on colonial streets. The warning apparently went in one ear of King George III and out the other, because his troops fired into a protesting crowd in Boston on March 5, 1770, killing 5 colonials. That, plus “a long train of abuses and usurpations” resulted in the repudiation of royal control.
In addition to decrying the “establishment of an absolute Tyranny” over the colonies, the Declaration specified 27 grievances against the King’s arbitrary and dictatorial rule. They included his: obstruction of laws for naturalizing foreigners, obstructing the “Administration of Justice,” making “Judges dependent on his Will alone,” cutting off colonial trade with the world, exciting domestic insurrections, “imposing Taxes on us without our Consent,” and making the military superior to the “Civil Power.”
After winning our war for independence, the former colonies adopted a Constitution and Bill of Rights to prevent the dictatorial rule they had suffered under the king. First and foremost, all government power was to be based on the consent of the people. That power would be divided among three branches, with checks and balances to prevent an accumulation of power. Congress would write the laws, the president would carry them out and the Supreme Court would act as an even-handed umpire. We were to have “a government of laws, not of men,” as Founding Father John Adams put it.
Some of the substantial powers granted to Congress were specifically intended to limit the arbitrary actions identified in the 27 grievances of the Declaration. Congress, not the president, would have the power to control the nation’s purse strings, to set taxes and tariffs, to regulate foreign and domestic commerce, to organize a militia and set rules for utilizing it, to provide for our national defense, to declare war, and to enact a wide variety of laws “necessary and proper” for the “general Welfare of the United States.”
The Constitution was drafted in Philadelphia at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. As the ink on the document was drying, a woman asked Ben Franklin, “What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” He replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.” Franklin was obviously not putting the onus on the lady, Mrs. Powel, to keep the republic. The “you” he referred to was all of us.
Franklin knew that future generations would lose this exceptional form of government if they did not work hard to keep it. It would take the same kind of unity, sacrifice and commitment that drove the Declaration signers to make the break with Great Britain. We can’t just sit on our hands and simply take advantage of our nation’s many blessings. Every citizen is obligated to contribute to the preservation of our democratic republic. 
As it is, many of us do not understand our history or what motivated our ancestors to sacrifice so much to provide us with this remarkable form of citizen-directed government. Even our current president misunderstands the purpose of the Declaration, believing it to be a “declaration of unity and love and respect,” rather than an indictment of kingly despotism. Too many members of Congress do not comprehend the tremendous power and responsibility they possess to provide for the common good of all Americans. Either that, or they simply refuse to fulfill their constitutional obligation to faithfully serve the public. Too many Americans fail to keep informed on public affairs. Too few citizens vote. Few serve this great nation.
All of us should take a cue from those who signed the Declaration of Independence and pledge to do more to serve and improve our country. We can start this Fourth of July by reflecting on what each of us might do to make this a more caring and communal society and how we might enlist others, including those with whom we have political disagreements, in achieving that goal. That would renew the spirit of that first Independence Day in 1776.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

The date of the”4th” has become synonymous with the holiday, with millions of Americans often wishing each other a “Happy 4th!”But if we’re going to be 100% accurate, we should probably start wishing each other a Happy 2nd. After all, July 2nd is the true date of American independence—the moment the colonies formally broke from British rule.
On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress took a momentous step by voting in favor of the resolution declaring the thirteen American colonies free and independent states. The vote passed without opposition, making it the legal and political moment the colonies severed ties with Britain.
John Adams, a leading advocate for independence, recognized the significance of this day. In a letter to his wife Abigail dated July 3, 1776, he wrote: “The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”
Adams envisioned future celebrations filled with “Pomp and Parade… from one End of this Continent to the other.”
Although the vote for independence happened on July 2, the Continental Congress took two more days to finalize the wording of the Declaration of Independence, primarily penned by Thomas Jefferson. The official document was adopted on July 4, and that date was printed on the first copies that were distributed to the public and newspapers.
Over time, the Fourth of July became etched in public memory as the date of independence, largely because it was the day Americans first saw the finished document. It became symbolic, representing the ideals and aspirations laid out in Jefferson’s powerful prose.
So history shows us that July 2 was the action; July 4 was the announcement.
Understanding this distinction helps us appreciate the courage it took to make that vote. It wasn’t just eloquent words that birthed a nation—it was a political leap into the unknown.
While July 4 will always remain a cherished holiday, there’s growing interest in restoring July 2 to its rightful place in history. Some historians, educators, and civic leaders advocate observing July 2 as a complementary moment of reflection — one that honors the bold decision that made the Declaration possible.
In doing so, we don’t replace the Fourth — we enrich it.
The fireworks of July 4 celebrate the ideals of liberty and equality. But July 2 was when independence truly began — when courage triumphed over fear, and a group of revolutionaries voted to create a new nation. Perhaps it’s time we gave July 2 the recognition it deserves: as the true Independence Day.

((Photo courtesy of the National Archives)July 4 has, since the inception of the United States, been synonymous with the nation’s best ideals — freedom to worship as we please, freedom of the press, freedom to criticize our government — and the notion that the U.S. is a haven for people around the world seeking such freedom. The date is a symbol of the knitting together of disparate states into one cohesive unit, the day on which a group of men came together to sign the Declaration of Independence to free colonists from the tyranny of an overreaching government.
And the greatest battle of the Civil War — the three-day bloodbath at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania — concluded on July 3, one day before what many Americans consider the most sacrosanct of national holidays. The battle was a turning point in a crisis that rent the U.S. for four years and, as President Abraham Lincoln said at the dedication of a cemetery in Gettysburg, tested “whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.”
The U.S. again finds itself being tested. Crackdowns on immigrants who come to our country to find a better life make a lie of the nation’s promises.
And so today, we publish the text of the Declaration of Independence in full as a reminder of the nation’s foundational ideals. 
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Thomas Paine in “Common Sense,” which helped persuade colonists to fight for independence from the British crown, faulted King George III for qualities that are all too familiar to Americans today.
The king had been “an inveterate enemy to liberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power,” Paine wrote, adding that the king was willing to accept no laws “but such as suit his purpose.”
Within half a year of the pamphlet’s publication, Americans declared, on July 4, 1776, their independence.
Half a year into his second term, President Donald Trump has adopted a king-like style of rule. His administration regularly deprives people of their liberty with little or no cause, and it repeatedly shows disdain for laws it doesn’t like. Trump’s policies are aggressively anti-American, more aligned by far with George III’s tyranny than with any of the country’s previous administrations.
On this Fourth of July, Constitution-abiding Americans might despair over the meaning of the holiday under these circumstances. What’s to celebrate when the president is as unaccountable as a monarch and the national government holds unalienable rights in contempt?
But the idea of the country persists even as the state of the country pains. The soul of the holiday isn’t the occupant of the White House or the manner of his rule or the innumerable ways America in practice failed to live up to its promise, never more so than in its earliest days and the decades that followed. Rather it’s the timeless ideals of equality and liberty that propelled the founding and inspired people around the world. And as they stood up in recent months for the values on which July 4 is a time to reflect, Coloradans have proved themselves worthy of the holiday and exemplars of its spirit.
They have plenty to celebrate.

On the day Trump was first inaugurated in 2017, more than 100,000 people in Denver protested against his presidency during the Women’s March, a worldwide demonstration for “human rights and equality,” and such acts of resistance to fascist encroachment have only expanded in Colorado since Trump’s second inauguration.
Coloradans have turned out in the streets time and again, at scale, to protest administration abuses. Enormous crowds appeared in Denver and elsewhere in the state on President’s Day, twice in April, in early June, and again in June as part of the nationwide No Kings movement, which saw thousands of protesters march even in Republican-leaning Mesa County.
Protesters who decry the lawless mass deportation activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have held a weekly vigil at the ICE detention center in Aurora, where the administration has detained, among many others, Denver immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra.
When in March U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York appeared in Greeley and Denver as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, they drew capacity crowds. The turnout in Denver was estimated at 34,000 people.
“In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever had a rally as large as this,” Sanders told Coloradans. “And Denver, your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado. You are sending a profound message all over the world. The whole world is watching, and they want to know if the people of America are going to stand up to Trumpism, oligarchy and authoritarianism.”
That message, that the fight against authoritarianism matters beyond state or national borders and can stir the political will of liberty-seeking people anywhere they live, is central to the idea of America. The American cause of the 1770s inspired French revolutionaries only a decade later and has been a model for anti-autocracy mobilization ever since. 
“The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth,” Paine wrote in 1776. “‘Tis not the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are virtually involved in the contest, and will be more or less affected, even to the end of time, by the proceedings now.”
The Fourth of July is an occasion for Coloradans to observe that they are still involved in the contest, still affected, as Paine foresaw, and that the worth of the cause could not be greater.

Article Summary

Illinois’ fiscal year 2026 budget reduced funding for programs serving homeless people by more than $14 million from the previous year.
JB Pritzker’s “Home Illinois” initiative aimed at reaching “functional zero” homelessness saw a $26.6 million cut.
That program was launched in 2022 and had previously been on a steady upward funding trend.
Advocates worry the reductions and potential federal cuts will exacerbate homelessness in Illinois, which increased 116% in 2024, according to state data.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


The number of homeless people in Illinois is rising, but the state’s spending on homeless prevention and other housing programs is headed in the other direction.

Facing a tight budget year with constrained spending and limited natural revenue growth, the $55.1 billion fiscal year 2026 budget that took effect July 1 reduces total funding for housing programs by more than $14 million, including Pritzker’s signature initiative designed to eliminate homelessness in Illinois.

“Last year homelessness increased 116% in the state of Illinois,” Doug Kenshol, co-founder of the Illinois Shelter Alliance, told Capitol News Illinois. “To be in the midst of this crisis and then have the state cut funding was beyond disappointing.”

Discretionary spending rose by less than 1% in the FY26 budget, according to the governor’s office, despite total spending increasing by $2 billion. That minimal spending growth led lawmakers to reduce several programs.

“Is it enough? No, it isn’t … we know that homelessness is an existential crisis, and the state of Illinois takes this seriously,” Sen. Adriane Johnson, D-Buffalo Grove, who serves on a state homeless prevention task force, told Capitol News Illinois. “We have a really bold vision for ending homelessness and we’re going to continue down that path.”

Spending reductions

Pritzker first established a task force by executive order in 2021 that would create a plan for “Home Illinois” to reduce homelessness in the state to “functional zero” — where homelessness is temporary and people without housing can quickly obtain housing resources. The executive order did not set a date for the state to reach functional zero, and funding for the Home Illinois is declining by $26.6 million in FY26.

Pritzker’s administration had previously targeted housing programs for substantial increases in recent years. The FY26 budget appropriated $263.7 million for Home Illinois, down from $290.3 million in FY25. That was a $90 million increase from FY24, when the program received $200.3 million in its first year after Pritzker signed legislation in 2023 codifying the task force and Home Illinois program.

Among the decreased spending in Home Illinois is a $25 million reduction to the Court-Based Rental Assistance Program that provides financial aid to people facing evictions. Other programs saw steady or increased funding, including shelters, which rose to fund Chicago’s One System Initiative that integrates migrants into the city’s typical shelter system.

Spending on housing programs is also down overall, according to the advocacy group Housing Action Illinois. While some housing programs saw increases that offset reductions to Home Illinois, total spending on housing programs is down by $14.6 million in the FY26 budget, to $354 million. Pritzker’s proposed budget had called for a $7.6 million decrease.

“FY26 is largely a maintenance year for the state budget,” an Illinois Department of Human Services spokesperson said in a statement. “We remain as committed as ever to advancing strategies that prevent and end homelessness across Illinois.”

Johnson said the spending reduction is “temporary” and the state is still working toward long-term goals that would require more funding.

“The state is trying to do the best it can with limited resources,” Housing Action Illinois Policy Director Bob Palmer said in an interview.

Some of the avenues lawmakers used to fund programs also divert funding away from one area in favor of another, Palmer said. For example, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is supposed to provide funding for new permanent rental housing, but money in the fund is also being used to increase funding for emergency or transitional housing.

“We were in a way glad to see that increase but also feeling conflicted because it’s taking money from another important housing resource,” Palmer said. “We had been advocating for that increase to come from general revenue funds.”

Funding for the emergency and transitional housing program increased by $7 million, a small win for advocates, but nowhere near the $40 million increase sought by the Illinois Shelter Alliance. The group wanted lawmakers to increase funding by $100 million overall for housing programs.

Palmer also worried proposed federal cuts to rental assistance programs will put additional strain on the state’s budget.

Homelessness continues to grow 

The spending reductions come as homelessness in Illinois continues to rise despite the new program.

The latest data on homelessness in Illinois from an October report by a Department of Human Services task force shows the state had 25,787 unhoused people on the night of the annual “point in time” count in January 2024 — a 116% increase from 2023.

The increase is largely driven by migrants who have been sent to Illinois by other states such as Texas. Of those without housing in January 2024, 13,891 were new arrivals. However, non-migrant homelessness is still on the rise, increasing 22% in 2024.

Homelessness is also increasing throughout the state. It’s up 207% since 2020 in Chicago, while DuPage and St. Clair counties were the only places in Illinois to see a decline over that time.

“You can argue that we can always do better, but Illinois is on the right path,” Johnson said.

Despite homelessness increasing since Home Illinois was established, Kenshol said the program is making a difference.

“They’ve created some great programs and they’ve gotten funds distributed and a lot of housing and a lot of shelter has been created, but we have to sustain that effort and we need to keep making incremental increases because we’re not there yet,” he said.

Data backs that up, according to IDHS. The Court-Based Rental Assistance Program, which received a substantial cut this year, has helped 7,500 households. And more than 18,000 people were served by Home Illinois in the first half of FY25 — 10,000 more than IDHS’ prior homelessness prevention program helped in FY22.

The problem, according to advocates and IDHS, is rapidly growing housing costs that make finding permanent housing and affording rent more unreachable for more people. A report last month from the Illinois Economic Policy Institute found Illinois needs 142,000 more housing units to meet the current demand for homes.

Finding more resources

Data in the task force’s annual report that provides a road map for Home Illinois shows service providers still need substantial resources to make a dent in homelessness. The state has more than 23,000 beds and housing units for homeless people, but needs about 27,000 more.

The task force, which includes advocates, lawmakers and top leaders in state agencies, says the problem will continue to grow if these resources aren’t addressed.

“The longer it takes to meet these targets, the more resources will be needed to reach functional zero as homelessness is a dynamic systems problem, or, in other words, annual unmet need for shelter and housing can be expected to increase each year that the need is unmet,” the report said.

Palmer agreed.

“If we’re taking the plan to prevent and end homelessness in Illinois seriously, we need to be providing the increased resources to eliminate that shortage … otherwise we’re just managing homelessness at its current level,” he said.

Palmer said lawmakers should be increasing funding for housing no matter what the state’s budget situation is because housing insecurity can be a root cause for other issues that cost the state more money, such as health problems.

Increasing funding for shelters alone also isn’t enough, said Kenshol, the Shelter Aliance co-founder. A lack of funding for affordable permanent housing leaves people stuck in the shelter system, which means growing rental assistance programs to help prevent people from being forced into shelters should be a budget priority, he said.

In a $55.1 billion budget, Kenshol argued the state should be able to find the money to increase funding each year for housing programs.

“As a society, as voters, as elected officials, we make different choices. We turn our backs on the people who are desperate and at risk of perishing and instead we invest in other things,” Kenshol said. “My values suggest that we should put caring for the least of these first.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Every item held by the Historical Society of North Dakota for display at the state Heritage Center has a story, including hundreds of flags that historians and conservators go to great lengths to protect.
“You can get a huge sense of pride from flags and they symbolize what you believe, but also symbolize what organizations you are a part of,” said Lori Nohner, research historian for the State Historical Society of North Dakota. “You can learn a lot from the histories of flags.”
Nohner said the Historical Society has about 340 flags in the collection, which includes about 150 military flags and pennants from different service units with North Dakota ties. 
Sen. Dick Dever, R-Bismarck, commander of the Bismarck-area AMVETS, said the beginning of the Pledge of Allegiance is to the flag, but also to the republic “for which it stands.”
“It’s not just a piece of cloth. It represents our whole country,” Dever said. “I didn’t serve in battle so I have indicated that I have served on the shoulders of heroes. And the guys that did serve, that flag is everything to them, as it is to me because of them.”
One flag in the museum’s collection is a replica 15-star American flag that would have been similar to one flown between 1795 and 1818, Nohner said. The 15-star field represented the original 13 colonies and the newly added states to the union, Vermont and Kentucky. 
A similar flag would have been flown over a newly completed Fort Mandan for the first time on Christmas Day in 1804 and was the same type of flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the, “The Star Spangled Banner,” during the War of 1812 in what would become the national anthem of the United States.

Nohner said her favorite flag in the collection belonged to Sara Sand of Grand Forks who served as a nurse at Base Hospital 60 in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France during World War I. Sand left a note with the 48-star, cotton flag that said the flag was hung in her company barracks at Camp Jackson in South Carolina and her barracks in France.
“You can see her uniform up on exhibit in the Inspiration Gallery,” she said. Sand served during the war with a Bismarck-area doctor, Dr. E.P. Quain, who founded the Quain and Ramstad Clinic in 1902, Nohner said. The Bismarck clinic was considered one of the oldest medical clinics in the United States and would eventually become Sanford Medical Center.
In the 1930s, Joe Wolf of Linton wanted to make a statement about low crop prices during the Great Depression and crafted a hand-painted flag made out of 5,340 kernels of wheat. Wolf wrote a description of his crafting process on the reverse side of the flag in which he said the flag took more than 80 hours to finish.
Another flag in the Historical Society’s collection is an unofficial flag, Nohner said. The 39-star flag is known as “the flag that never flew,” and was created prior to 1889, the year North Dakota and South Dakota became states.

“Flag manufacturers believed that the Dakotas were going to come into the union as one state and they didn’t,” she said. “So it was never an official flag, but they made enough of them that they still exist today.”
The Historical Society also has a small flag from 1919 in its collection that is designed to be waved by hand with written text on the flag saying “signing of big bills.”

“The big bills they are talking about is when they created the Bank of North Dakota, the North Dakota Mill and Elevator and the state Industrial Commission,” Nohner said. “All of those Nonpartisan League institutions are still active in our state today and are now very unique to North Dakota.”
Nohner said the museum recently acquired a North Dakota state flag that was taken to space by North Dakota astronaut James Buchli in 1985.
“In our records we have a field that says, ‘Where did he use it?’ and it says, ‘Outer space,’” she said. “He gifted it to the historical society when he was inducted into the Roughrider Hall of Fame.”

Another famed flag in the museum’s collection is the decommissioning flag from the USS Gurke, a Navy destroyer in service from 1945 to 1976 that was named after a World War II medal of honor recipient and Neche-native Henry Gurke.
“They gifted the decommissioning flag to his mom and his mom gifted it to us,” Nohner said.
Another service flag in the museum’s collection was originally given to families of service members who were fighting in World War I and World War II. Nohner said families would hang these pennants in their windows with a blue star indicating someone in their family was fighting in the conflict. Those blue stars were made into gold stars, if the service member died during the war.
Nohner said the gold star pennant in their collection belonged to Mable Guy who lost her son James Guy after he died in a prisoner of war camp during World War II. Mable Guy also had a pennant with three blue stars on it to represent her three sons who fought during the war, one of her sons was former North Dakota Gov. William Guy.
Flags will be featured prominently in Independence Day parades and celebrations across North Dakota. 
Dever said the proper way to honor a passing flag is a hand salute for military veterans or placing a hand over the heart to honor the first flag in a procession. 
“I think flags start as just a physical object, but they never end that way,” Nohner said. “They always become a personal identity symbol. They are more than what they look like, they are what they mean to you.”




Tips for preserving flags
Lori Nohner said the State Historical Society of North Dakota does not restore flags at the Heritage Center, but they do preserve them to the best of their ability. 
“Our intended purpose is to keep it in good condition for hundreds and hundreds of years,” Nohner said.
She offered some guidelines for anyone wanting to preserve flags 
Climate control: Do not leave items in the sun, or nail them to a wall. Do not put the items in an attic, or a humid basement. 
“If it’s a comfortable temperature for you, it’s going to be a comfortable temperature for your historic treasures,” she said.
She also advised against vacuum-sealing. “I think you are asking for trouble when you create, kind of, a micro climate so you never know if humidity is going to get in there, and it’s going to get wet and moldy,” Nohner said. 
Folding vs. flat:  Folding flags in a ceremonial triangle can be a good way to store the flags, but with more fragile materials, such as silk, covering them with paper to keep them out of the light and laying them out flat are the best ways to care for those items.
Rolling a flag tightly around a pole is not advised, but, if rolling is necessary, Nohner suggests wrapping the flag loosely around a wider than normal tube to limit the stress on the fabric.

As a reminder of the nation’s foundational principles and ideals, we’re running the full text of the nation’s Declaration of Independence, which, 249 years ago on this day, helped chart a new course for the United States of America.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

You were born here. So was I. The rub is I was born to immigrants who were not yet legal residents.
That makes me a birthright citizen under the 14th Amendment. That also allegedly makes me an “anchor baby.” I’m referring to the assertion that immigrants have come to the U.S. and have  babies only so they can gain  legal residency later.
Real life is more complicated than that for millions of immigrants who come to the U.S. for a variety of reasons — whether they are fleeing violence in their home countries or simply seeking a better life, as generations in our nation of immigrants have done. 
Does the immigration status of my parents really matter? How long ago  did your immigrant ancestors first step foot here? How many generations does it take for citizenship to be “deserved?”
The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says unequivocally that I’m as deserving as the accident of your birth makes you. If you are born here, you’re a U.S. citizen. Me, too. That’s birthright citizenship.
On Jan. 20, newly inaugurated President Donald Trump issued an executive order ending automatic citizenship for babies born to parents who don’t have lawful status in the U.S.  
In a recent 6-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court did not address  the constitutionality of Trump’s order. Instead, it ruled that lower courts have no power to issue nationwide injunctions,  voiding  district courts’  rulings that Trump may not deport people who have been U.S. citizens all their lives.  
After the ruling, some groups began the slow process to challenge the law in a nationwide class action lawsuit. But until the Court decides otherwise, the fundamental question whether someone is considered a U.S. citizen will have different answers in different states. 
Meanwhile, raids on immigrant communities continue.
The Trump administration is clearly emboldened. The Supreme Court’s ruling allows the ban on birthright citizenship to take effect in those 28 states that didn’t challenge the president’s initial executive order. And the administration is counting on the high court to see it his way on the constitutional question eventually.
At this point, I lack the confidence to say it won’t.
I understand the argument that  children born to U.S. citizens are more deserving than I am. “But my ancestors emigrated here legally,” say more “deserving” citizens. Never mind that the barriers to coming to this country legally have moved up and down. Today, even people with demonstrable asylum claims are being shut out.
Back in the day, if you showed up to these shores, you simply got in. It wasn’t until 1924 that the U.S. started enforcing quotas for national origin. Aside from immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe (deemed then as too foreign, i.e. not white enough), these quotas favored other white immigrants. And it specifically targeted Asians for exclusion.
This preference for white immigrants continues. White immigrants from, say, Canada and Ireland, don’t seem to be affected by this attempted purge.
So let’s be honest. Many of your immigrant ancestors were legal simply by default.
Other people will argue that ICE is targeting immigrants  who have committed violent crimes. A couple of big problems: according to the libertarian CATO Institute, 65% of those taken by ICE have no criminal record and 93% have not committed a violent crime. 
As a group, immigrants are a safer group than U.S.-born citizens. They commit fewer crimes.
The issue is not criminality. It’s race. All across the country,  Latinos are being detained because of the color of their skin.
Some folks insist that the 14th Amendment dealt only with the children of slaves freed after the Civil War. 
Here’s what the amendment says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (my emphasis), are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” 
Clearly, even those here without documents are subject to U.S. and state laws. That puts them under U.S. jurisdiction. The courts have confirmed birthright citizenship as early as the late 19th Century (United States v. Wong Kim Ark.).
Is military service an indication of deserving citizenship?
Immigrants and their children are populations the military covets for recruitment. About 5% of active-duty personnel are children of immigrants and 12%  of living veterans are immigrants or the children of immigrants.
Meanwhile, there is a shrinking pool of Americans able to serve, owing to their own criminality, fitness and, importantly, willingness.
So, maybe this ire for birthright citizens like me is about how much of a drain we are on government services and the economy.
But, bucking a trend for other Americans, the children of immigrants often surpass the economic success of their parents. That’s been true in my family and virtually everyone else with my background I’ve encountered.
So, who deserves to be a citizen?
I contend that a chief quality of those who  deserve citizenship is that they don’t take their citizenship for granted. They know their parents sacrificed much to make it happen. We are proud Americans. We belong here. And we deserve to stay.

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Myeloma Center, part of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, is the only institution in the state that offers CAR T-cell therapy to patients with multiple myeloma. While the blood cancer is not currently curable, symptoms can be addressed and progression can be slowed through various treatments.
CAR T-cell therapy is a weekslong process that involves harvesting T-cells, a type of white blood cell, from multiple myeloma patients’ blood and sending them to a lab where they are trained to attack cancer cells, according to Dr. Samer Al Hadidi, an associate professor at UAMS’ College of Medicine.
Once this process is complete, patients receive an infusion of the newly trained cells after being given a low dose of chemotherapy to make room for the cells, Al Hadidi said. 
A study presented in June at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, showed prolonged periods of remission for patients who received a specific CAR T-cell therapy called CARVYKTI®. 
Of the 97 “heavily pretreated” patients that received this therapy, about a third remained alive and progression free for five or more years without further treatment. Patients in the study historically were expected to be progression free for less than six months and live for about a year, on average, according to a press release. 
  Dr. Samer Al Hadidi (Courtesy of UAMS)
Al Hadidi said “the beauty” of this therapy is it works for hard-to-treat patients and has the potential to be used for long-term disease control. The possibility of using this treatment on patients in earlier stages of the disease and achieving the same or better results is “what gets most people excited about it,” he said. 
“We continue to offer it to patients. I think it’s a really promising therapy. We’re really happy that we have this product here in Arkansas,” Al-Hadidi said.
Multiple myeloma can cause various symptoms like bone fractures, anemia, fatigue and kidney failure, some of which are shared with other diseases, Al-Hadidi said. Typically, multiple myeloma presents in people in their late 60s and is more common among men and African Americans, he said. 
Seventy-one-year-old Donna Kidder doesn’t fall into any of those categories and was surprised by her diagnosis in 2012. Kidder said learning she had multiple myeloma was “a fluke” that resulted from a bone density test she requested to assess the efficacy of a drug she was taking to treat her osteoporosis. The test revealed more bone loss than could be explained, she said. 
“I was running 10 miles a week and drinking green smoothies for breakfast,” Kidder said. “I’m like, ‘this isn’t fair. I’m in good health.’ But it turns out that good health helped me deal with all the treatments I’ve had in the last 13 years.”
Kidder, who lives in North Carolina, came to UAMS for therapy at the recommendation of a neighbor, whose friend had previously received treatment for multiple myeloma in Little Rock. 
“I’m very appreciative of the care that I got at UAMS because I’m not sure I would be talking to you today if I didn’t get that initial care,” she said. 


Let us know what you think...


 

CAR T-cell therapy wasn’t an option at the time, so Kidder initially received a stem cell transplant. Throughout her multiple myeloma journey, she’s received two stem cell transplants and two CAR T-cell therapy treatments. 
Kidder received her CAR T-cell treatments closer to home at Duke University Health System. The therapy from the study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting has been the most effective for Kidder, who said she’s been in remission since December 2023. 
Patients like Kidder often have to undergo maintenance treatment in between therapies, some of which have difficult side effects, like nausea. Kidder said she’s interested in learning about new treatments, but will consider first the impact on her quality of life before committing to any of them.

Reflecting back on more than a dozen years of living with multiple myeloma, Kidder said treatment for the disease has changed so much, and she’s concerned about cuts to federal funding for medical research generally, “not so much for myself because I get to be 71.” 
After her initial diagnosis, Kidder was told she only had three to five years to live. Her goal was to live long enough to see her grandson graduate from high school. 
Her grandson has finished his first year in college.
Citing a friend in her 30s who’s been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Kidder said the disease is hitting younger people and “research is so important.”
The president’s budget request includes cutting the National Institutes of Health’s budget by $18 billion, or 40%, a proposal that has drawn bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who are concerned the cuts would delay or halt the development of treatments and cures for diseases like cancer. 
“I’m very concerned about cuts to research…I also feel a responsibility that the nation has paid a lot to keep me alive, it’s been expensive, and so I feel it’s my obligation to live fully,” Kidder said.  
Part of that full life includes sharing her experiences with multiple myeloma, especially with newly diagnosed patients. 
“I remembered meeting people who had been alive for 20 years with myeloma and I was fascinated to hear about their experience,” she said. “So now, 13 years, I’m that person. I’m that person that gives them hope.”

As a refugee, I bought this flag not because America is perfect, but because of its promise.
The first time I saw the American flag, I was 9 years old. My family and I were at the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, preparing to return to Afghanistan after years of fleeing the Taliban and living in exile. 
We waited to be vaccinated and processed for return, and the American flag was attached to the back of a U.S. Army vehicle. My uncle, pointing at the flag, said, “Look, now we will be safe.” At that moment, the American flag felt like a promise. 
Since then, the flag’s meaning has shifted, but I refuse to let hate define it.

Years later, I was granted a student visa and arrived in the United States as an international student. In the airport, I stood again in front of the American flag, where it waved its 13 red and white stripes and 50 stars. It was a profound moment when I felt welcomed. I knew then, deep in my heart, that I was safe and my life was full of possibilities. 
As I experienced America and life in it, that sense of safety changed. Slowly, I began to fear the flag that once gave me hope.
I saw the American flag in the hands of people shouting vulgar things about immigrants. I saw it on t-shirts worn by those who looked at me with hate. I started to believe that when an American flag was hanging on someone’s porch or painted on their truck, it meant I wasn’t welcome. The flag that once symbolized safety and freedom slowly started to feel like a warning.
But, a few days ago, I found myself revisiting the most joyful moments of my life in this country: arriving in the U.S. for the first time, the day I became a U.S. citizen, my siblings making it to America safely, and my mother stepping off a plane onto American soil. 
In every photo from those moments, we are smiling — some of us crying — with the American flag waving in the background. Despite everything, that flag was always there, not just in fear, but in celebration of survival and homecoming.
This Independence Day, I bought an American flag.
I do not believe this country is perfect, but I believe we belong in it. I know we are part of America’s flawed, painful, and beautiful story. I bought the flag because we, too, arrived here with teary eyes and hopeful hearts. Like that little girl at the border all those years ago, I still choose to believe in the promise of safety, dignity and a better life.
But belief alone is not enough. We must act.
When you turn on the news or scroll through social media, the stories are grim. The Trump administration continues to sow fear and division. In states like Maine, where refugees are revitalizing communities, federal policies are stripping refugee resettlement while programs have been indefinitely paused. Funding cuts have gutted resettlement and legal support systems. Fundamental rights, such as asylum and due process, are under constant attack. Families are being separated. People from entire countries are once again banned from entering America. Refugee and immigrant rights organizations are being systematically targeted. 
Last year, 625 refugees found safety in Maine, bringing their resilience, vibrancy, and skills to a state facing an aging population and labor shortages. Maine’s essential refugee agencies are now grappling with how to preserve basic services after federal funding cuts gutted their support systems. These actions are a cowardly way to treat people who have crossed continents and oceans, left everything behind, and risked it all to come home.
For many of us, America was not our first choice. However, it is our last hope. And still, we love this country not because it’s easy, but because we’ve invested our futures in its promises and potential. Refugees know that we are not just part of America—we help make it whole.
As we step into a new chapter of American history, the flag belongs to us all. The flag, and the country for which it stands, belongs to those who believe in something better, kinder, and in the promise of liberty and justice for all. It belongs to everyone who dares to hope, who fights for compassion, and who still—despite everything—believes in its promise. This flag is our flag.

(Photo: Chuck Estes, Tennessee Citizens for Wilderness Planning)As East Tennesseans and tourists alike enjoy summer fun on the Obed Wild and Scenic River, enthusiasts are growing its amount of federally protected land.
Part of the U.S. National Park Service, the Obed Wild and Scenic River in Cumberland and Morgan Counties on Tennessee’s Cumberland Plateau offers swimming, hiking, picnicking, kayaking, fishing and climbing at the federally protected Obed Wild and Scenic River lands. It currently includes about 45 miles along streams like the Obed and Emory Rivers. 
Residents of Oak Ridge, a little less than an hour’s drive away, created Tennessee Citizens for Wilderness Planning (TCWP) and lobbied to create the federally protected area in 1976. Now, the same group, through fundraising and land swaps with anonymous private individuals, has gained 30 acres on which it plans to build a trail connected to the federal land. 
The new trail loop will let visitors hike through a forest and into a gorge and they can follow Ramsey Creek to a small waterfall.
TCWP’s Chuck Estes said the property is not open to the public yet. The organization plans to finish building the trail first before giving the area to the National Park Service. Estes said TCWP still has some paperwork to do before the transfer is final.
“It will provide a high-quality experience to hikers walking the small gorge, protect a mature forest, and ensure continued excellent water quality in Ramsey Creek,” Estes said, adding that moisture in the canyon supports supports salamanders, including hellbenders, and other amphibians along with other distinctive plants and animals.
“Surveying the property may find other interesting animal and plant species and some may be species of concern that will be protected through purchase of the property,” he said.

In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/declaration-of-independence-copy-1024x636.jpeg,,,2025-07-04 06:03:13.902007

A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Photo by Walter Bibikow/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget is called a “skinny budget” because it’s short on line-by-line details.

But historic preservation efforts in the U.S. did get a mention — and they might as well be skinned to the bone.
Trump has proposed to slash funding for the federal Historic Preservation Fund to only $11 million, which is $158 million less than the fund’s previous reauthorization in 2024. The presidential discretionary budget, however, always heads to Congress for appropriation. And Congress always makes changes.
That said, the Trump administration hasn’t even released the $188 million that Congress appropriated for the fund for the 2025 fiscal year, essentially impounding the funding stream that Congress created in 1976 for historic preservation activities across the nation.
I’m a scholar of historic preservation who’s worked to secure historic designations for buildings and entire neighborhoods. I’ve worked on projects that range from making distressed neighborhoods in St. Louis eligible for historic tax credits to surveying Cold War-era hangars and buildings on seven U.S. Air Force bases.
I’ve seen the ways in which the Historic Preservation Fund helps local communities maintain and rehabilitate their rich architectural history, sparing it from deterioration, the wrecking ball or the pressures of the private market.
A rare, deficit-neutral funding model
Most Americans probably don’t realize that the task of historic preservation largely falls to individual states and Native American tribes.
The National Historic Preservation Act that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1966 requires states and tribes to handle everything from identifying potential historic sites to reviewing the impact of interstate highway projects on archaeological sites and historic buildings. States and tribes are also responsible for reviewing nominations of sites in the National Register of Historic Places, the nation’s official list of properties deemed worthy of preservation.
However, many states and tribes didn’t have the capacity to adequately tackle the mandates of the 1966 act. So the Historic Preservation Fund was formed a decade later to alleviate these costs by funneling federal resources into these efforts.
The fund is actually the product of a conservative, limited-government approach.
Created during Gerald Ford’s administration, it has a revenue-neutral model, meaning that no tax dollars pay for the program. Instead, it’s funded by private lease royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas reserves.
Most of these reserves are located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska. Private companies that receive a permit to extract from them must agree to a lease with the federal government. Royalties from their oil and gas sales accrue in federally controlled accounts under the terms of these leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue then directs 1.5% of the total royalties to the Historic Preservation Fund.
Congress must continually reauthorize the amount of funding reserved for the Historic Preservation Fund, or it goes unfunded.

Despite bipartisan support, the fund has been threatened in the past. President Ronald Reagan attempted to do exactly what Trump is doing now by making no request for funding at all in his 1983 budget. Yet the fund has nonetheless been reauthorized six times since its inception, with terms ranging from five to 10 years.
The program is a crucial source of funding, particularly in small towns and rural America, where privately raised cultural heritage funds are harder to come by. It provides grants for the preservation of buildings and geographical areas that hold historical, cultural or spiritual significance in underrepresented communities. And it’s even involved in projects tied to the nation’s 250th birthday in 2026, such as the rehabilitation of the home in New Jersey where George Washington was stationed during the winter of 1778-79 and the restoration of Rhode Island’s Old State House.
Filling financial gaps
I’ve witnessed the fund’s impact firsthand in small communities across the nation.
Edwardsville, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, is home to the Leclaire Historic District. In the 1970s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The national designation recognized the historic significance of the district, protecting it against any adverse impacts from federal infrastructure funding. It also made tax credits available to the town. Edwardsville then designated LeClaire a local historic district so that it could legally protect the indelible architectural features of its homes, from original decorative details to the layouts of front porches.
Despite the designation, however, there was no clear inventory of the hundreds of houses in the district. A few paid staffers and a volunteer citizen commission not only had to review proposed renovations and demolitions, but they also had to figure out which buildings even contributed to LeClaire’s significance and which ones did not – and thus did not need to be tied up in red tape.

  The Allen House is one of approximately 415 single-family homes in the Leclaire neighborhood in Edwardsville, Ill. Friends of Leclaire
Edwardsville was able to secure a grant through the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office thanks to a funding match enabled by money disbursed to Illinois via the Historic Preservation Fund.
In 2013, my team created an updated inventory of the historic district, making it easier for the local commission to determine which houses should be reviewed carefully and which ones don’t need to be reviewed at all.
Oil money better than no money
The historic preservation field, not surprisingly, has come out strongly against Trump’s proposal to defund the Historic Preservation Fund.
Nonetheless, there have been debates within the field over the fund’s dependence on the fossil fuel industry, which was the trade-off that preservationists made decades ago when they crafted the funding model.
In the 1970s, amid the national energy crisis, conservation of existing buildings was seen as a worthy ecological goal, since demolition and new construction required fossil fuels. To preservationists, diverting federal carbon royalties seemed like a power play.
But with the effects of climate change becoming impossible to ignore, some preservationists are starting to more openly critique both the ethics and the wisdom of tapping into a pool of money created through the profits of the oil and gas industry. I’ve recently wondered myself if continued depletion of fossil fuels means that preservationists won’t be able to count on the Historic Preservation Fund as a long-term source of funding.
That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a preservationist who thinks that destroying the Historic Preservation Fund would be a good first step in shaping a more visionary policy.
For now, Trump’s administration has only sown chaos in the field of historic preservation. Already, Ohio has laid off one-third of the staffers in its State Historic Preservation Office due to the impoundment of federal funds. More state preservation offices may follow suit. The National Council of State Historic Preservation Officers predicts that states soon could be unable to perform their federally mandated duties.
Unfortunately, many people advocating for places important to their towns and neighborhoods may end up learning the hard way just what the Historic Preservation Fund does.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)BOZEMAN, Mont. — With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries.

The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.

“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

It’s why we’re celebrating America’s Independence Day and not paying homage to a king or queen. Or living under a tyrant’s thumb — yet.
The document has some faults, declaring for instance that “all men are created equal” even though at the time it was written, women, enslaved people and Indigenous people weren’t considered equal to white men of means. The document contains some racial slurs, but its preamble continues to echo down the centuries to inspire millions, including those who weren’t born in the United States.
The United States as we know it didn’t even exist in 1776, but this Declaration of Independence ignited the spark that resulted in the first nation on earth to be brought into existence by an idea not based on ethnic or religious identity. And that idea has grown to encompass all people and engendered more to aspire to equity for everyone.
The Declaration itself is mostly a long list of grievances leaders of the 13 British colonies had against King George III that formed the stated rationale of separating the colonies from the king’s rule. History shows that another reason for fomenting resolution involved who would colonize the Native lands west of the colonies.
All-in-all, not really that noble a rationale for starting a war.
But those stirring words that begin the Declaration embraced a noble ideal for founding a new nation. Despite the document’s flaws, and the flaws and mistakes that dog our collective history down through today, it serves to remind us of our common heritage and why we are Americans.
So, here it is, a transcription from the National Archives:
 
Note: The following text is a transcription of the Stone Engraving of the parchment Declaration of Independence (the document on display in the Rotunda at the National Archives Museum.) The spelling and punctuation reflects the original.
In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit ofHappiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their justpowers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unlesss uspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing theLaws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein anArbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolvedf rom all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As America approaches the midway point of this decade, we can agree that it has been one heck of a year. 
Following the news and social media, we see ongoing and emerging challenges in the international arena. Domestically, we continue to struggle with this great experiment called democracy for our society and its culture, which defines the daily experience of Americans.
This weekend, we will celebrate July 4, 1776, as Independence Day to mark our declaration of intention to separate from a government that tread on our unalienable rights of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
That historic document was signed by delegates of the Pennsylvania Provincial Conference, officially the Provincial Conference of Committees of the Province of Pennsylvania, which made up the Provincial Congress. During a week in June, its delegates met in Carpenters’ Hall in Philadelphia, then with the Second Continental Congress, to support the national Declaration of Independence. 
What American colonists sought then was freedom from an oppressive system and subsequently demonstrated they were willing to fight and die for such freedom.
In the closing minutes of his January 1941 State of the Union Address and in the wake of  the U.S. entering the Second World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke of four freedoms as values of democratic societies. In preceding years, totalitarian and fascist regimes of Germany, Japan, and Italy continually demonstrated disregard for such values. In his exhortation, FDR built the case for U.S. intervention for the sake of others — that is, the security of allied governments and their people:
“In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world.
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world.
The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor — anywhere in the world.”
The themes of FDR’s “The Four Freedoms” speech are expanded upon by essays from renowned American writers. The essay that spoke to me most in the current context of our American struggles was penned in March 1943 by Pennsylvania-born [Lehigh Valley] Pulitzer Price recipient, Stephen Vincent Benét. In “Freedom from Fear,” he offered:
“What do we mean when we say, ‘freedom from fear?’ It isn’t just a formula or a set of words. It’s a look in the eyes and a feeling in the heart and a thing to be won against odds. It goes to the roots of life — to a man and a woman and their children and the home they can make and keep…
“Since our nation began, men and women have come here for just that freedom — freedom from the fear that lies at the heart of every unjust law, of every tyrannical exercise of power by one man over another man….
“We do not mean freedom from responsibility — freedom from struggle and toil, from hardship and danger. We do not intend to breed a race wrapped in cotton wool, too delicate to stand rough weather. In any world of man that we can imagine, fear and the conquest of fear must play a part.
“But we have the chance, if we have the brains and the courage, to destroy the worst fears that harry man today — the fear of starving to death, the fear of being a slave, the fear of being stamped into the dust because he is one kind of man and not another, the fear of unprovoked attack and ghastly death for himself and for his children because of the greed and power of willful and evil men and deluded nations.”
  An American Flag hangs in the window of a house in Normandy, France. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)
More than eight decades later, the case for fear still exists in 2025 as Americans face global and regional conflicts, the potential collapse of international economies, and social, as well as political challenges to its democratic institutions. We cannot be afraid to address injustice within our nation.
Benét also pointed back to the Declaration of Independence when “…we, as a nation, asserted that all men were created equal, that all men were entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those were large assertions, but we have tried to live up to them. We have not always succeeded; we have often failed. But our will and desire as a nation have been to live up to them.”
One might wonder how delegates of the 1776 Pennsylvania Provincial Conference would view today’s status of the four freedoms across our state and the nation. In the months ahead and for the remainder of this decade, it is my hope that we resolve and pursue freedom from fear for others in our American society and, in doing so, for ourselves.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Congress on Thursday afternoon passed the sweeping spending package dubbed the “one big beautiful bill,” marking a major legislative win for President Donald Trump — but clean energy advocates say it could derail future renewable projects.
The House approved the measure after the Senate significantly revised the original proposal. For a moment, the renewable energy industry was stunned by provisions that included a proposed tax on solar and wind power, along with an accelerated phase out of Biden-era tax credits.
Although the final version of the bill dropped the proposed tax, it also eliminated the electric vehicle tax credit established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It further shortened the window for renewable energy projects to qualify for solar and wind credits. Under the new rules, eligible projects must begin construction within a year of the bill’s passage and be placed in service by the end of 2027. 
“I was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act to help position Virginia as a leader in clean energy technology, putting us on a path toward 20,000 new jobs and lower energy costs,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement. 
“…Why would President Trump and congressional Republicans undo such historic and effective legislation, and go even further to hurt clean energy by imposing new requirements many wind and solar projects won’t be able to meet?”
The tighter deadlines have raised alarms for projects still in the approval pipeline across several states. Appalachian Voices, an environmental advocacy group, said the bill could jeopardize local and community-led initiatives. 
“If you start that project and you have an unexpected delay, but you’re still relying on the credits to get through the end of financing, then you’re just put in a really bad position,” said Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices. “Especially if you have that project currently moving, and already understand that it’s not going to be placed in service by the deadlines that were imposed. Then you’re just maybe a community organization or a church just left holding the bag.”
Zedack said the tax credits don’t just benefit large scale solar and wind farms for utilities, emphasizing that there have been a number of small community solar projects that were boosted by the credit. 
For example, Lee County Public Schools implemented 1.4 megawatt panels across seven schools, along with job training programs. Appalachian Voices reports the school district saved over $3 million over the lifetime of the project. 
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., stated he is deeply disappointed by the roll backs of renewable energy incentives in the bill, especially after Virginia has made significant strides under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
The fossil fuel industry, however, came out ahead in the bill. In the final Senate version, metallurgical mines are eligible for a 2.5% tax credit for production. While Virginia has steadily reduced coal production in recent years, there are still more than 100 active mines, mostly in the southwestern part of the state.
“A lot of most of the metallurgical coal that is produced in the United States comes from Appalachia, and most of that product is exported to other countries like India and China to produce cheaper steel,” Zedack said.
The bill passed the house with a margin of 218-214 with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against the measure. The measure now heads to the president’s desk for his signature — ahead of the July 4 deadline imposed by Trump.

About 35 million years ago, Hampton Roads was underwater, with the coastline dozens of miles west toward Richmond.
Dinosaurs were long gone, but the ocean teemed with marine creatures such as ancient whales, sharks and sea stars.
That is until one unfortunate day, when life across what’s now southeastern Virginia was obliterated within seconds.
A bolide – an extraterrestrial object such as an asteroid or comet – hurtled out of space and landed in the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay.
“There was a kill zone that would have been several hundred miles out in every direction,” said Rich Whittecar, a geologist and emeritus professor at Old Dominion University.
The volcanic-like lateral blast from the impact ripped through faster than the speed of sound, with exponentially more explosive power than atomic bombs detonated by humans, Whittecar said.
Plants and animals would be “totally shredded” by all the material – and simultaneously incinerated by the intense heat.
“Not a good day,” Whittecar said.
Geologists first pieced together the story of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater in the 1990s. It’s the largest known bolide strike in the U.S. and among the largest in the world.
But new research is the first to document the far-reaching impacts of the collision. Scientists say they uncovered a site 240 miles away in the Sandhills of North Carolina showing traces of a massive tsunami caused by the Virginia asteroid.
And the discovery all started by chance.
 A mystery buried underground

Almost a decade ago, retired consulting geologist Bob Ganis was investigating some fossils in Moore County, N.C. when he got a call from a local property owner nearby.

A pipeline was set to be constructed through the edge of her property called Paint Hill Farm, and she wondered if Ganis might like to come investigate the temporary trench as part of his research.
Ganis accepted the offer and it became “one of the most strange days of my life,” he said.
He took a look at the rock layers exposed about 10 feet deep and was “totally baffled.” What he saw didn’t align with his geological understanding of the region.
“I had no idea what it was, and no reports of this kind of geology were available to understand what it was,” he said.
Thus began a yearslong quest to get to the bottom of the mystery trapped in sediment. The first piece of the puzzle was determining the age of the rock layers in question.
Ganis said he found fossilized shark teeth nearby and worked with peers who helped date them to the late Eocene era, which lasted from about 56 to 34 million years ago.
Next Ganis connected with Ralph Willoughby with the South Carolina Geological Survey, and described the mysterious sediment layers. They methodically went through the rock beds to try and explain each within the geological context of the region.
“When we get to the top, this explanation of all this rubble at the top, we’re still scratching our heads,” Ganis said. “‘What is this stuff?’”
One day, looking at photos from the trench site, “a light bulb goes off,” he said. “It struck us (that) this is a tsunami deposit.”
There was no geological history to explain why such a deposit would be there, except for one: the meteoroid strike up in Virginia on that fateful day 35 million years ago.
 Solving the mystery 





A Map Shows The Outline Of The Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater (Photo courtesy U.S. Geological Survey)




The asteroid, moving at about 44,000 miles per hour, was about 2 to 3 miles wide and blasted an enormous crater into the continental shelf of modern day Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Much of the crater is still underwater in the bay, which is why it took until recent decades for scientists to discover. The circular outline of the impact in Hampton Roads includes the bottom half of the Eastern Shore, northern edge of Norfolk and eastern outskirts of the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula.
Like any object that lands in water, the asteroid caused a big splash – a giant tsunami likely thousands of feet high, “the kind of tsunami that the world rarely sees,” Ganis said.
It likely washed over the Blue Ridge Mountains and swept across the Southeast – maybe even over the Atlantic Ocean to lap at the shores of Africa and Europe, he said.
Scientists described such a wide-reaching tsunami when they first investigated the Chesapeake Bay impact crater but no one had found actual remains of it.
Ganis’ team homed in on the tsunami as a likely explanation for the Paint Hill rock formation, but needed more evidence to prove it.
The bottom layer featured charcoal, natural glass and other rock fragments; materials you would expect to fly out of the impact, Ganis said. It also had the hallmarks of a “tremendously hot blast.” Another layer contained ash from the explosion.

Whittecar, the ODU geologist, came in to help figure out the top layer, a sandy conglomeration including petrified wood and what looked like a substance called plinthite. The team needed an expert to confirm.
“I went down (to) look at this stuff and basically said, ‘Yep, that’s plinthite,’” Whittecar said.
The material is an iron-rich, clumpy reddish clay common in tropical regions. Researchers believe the Virginia tsunami swept up this material from the seabed and ended up at Paint Hill.

The presence of iridium in the sediment helped nail down the team’s tsunami theory. It is an extremely rare metal on Earth but common in asteroids.
The researchers published their collaborative findings in the peer-reviewed journal Southeastern Geology last month.
Paint Hill’s owner recently sold the 300-acre property to the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which plans to turn it over to the state park system to expand the Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve.
The tsunami deposits will be preserved and may become a “highlight of the park” through related exhibits and educational activities, Ganis said.
Whittecar said geologists are interested in this type of work largely out of curiosity and advancing knowledge for future generations.
“From the practical hazard prevention side of things,” he said, “of course it does give a little weight to the notion that if we can stop one of these (asteroids) from hitting, it is worth getting out there and nudging that thing out of the way.”

(Photo by Jerry Glaser/Customs and Border Protection)State, federal and local officials who fought for years to bring the new FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County said Tuesday the fight is not over, after the surprise Trump administration announcement that the agency will stay downtown.
The FBI will move into existing space at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the current dilapidated headquarters in the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building, according to a statement from the FBI and the General Services Administration.
“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in the statement.
The move reverses a 2023 GSA decision that identified a site near the Greenbelt Metro for the new headquarters, following years of study and of competition between Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions to land the site.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), Prince Georges’ County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D) and almost all of the state’s congressional delegation — calling themselves Team Maryland — insisted Tuesday that Greenbelt is still the better site.

“Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities. That’s why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have,” the Team Maryland statement said.
The agency has been seeking new headquarters for years to replace the J. Edgar Hoover Building, a brutalist facility that is cramped, has leaks and pieces of concrete occasionally falling onto the street below.
In November 2023, the GSA picked Greenbelt over another site in Prince George’s County, Landover, and over a site in Springfield, Virginia.
Virginia representatives charged that the selection of Maryland was flawed after a federal inspector general’s report released in February found fault with the process. But the report never stated there was a problem with the Greenbelt site itself.
Whatever reservations they may have had about the Greenbelt site, however, was put aside by Virginia’s senators for criticism of the Reagan Building proposal, which Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said “isn’t a plan, it’s a punt.” The two Democrats said the choice of a new site was typical of the Trump administration’s haphazard approach to the federal workforce.
“For years, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have agreed on the need for a secure, purpose-built headquarters that actually meets the FBI’s mission needs,” said a joint statement from Kaine and Warner, “This announcement brushes aside years of careful planning, ignores the recommendations of security and mission experts, and raises serious concerns about how this decision was made.”
President Donald Trump has never been a fan of moving the FBI out of the District. He tried to cancel it in his first term and in March of this year, less that two months after returning to office, he said he would not let the agency move “three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state.” He quickly said the state’s political leanings had no bearing on his decision, but never corrected the fact that Greenbelt is about 16 miles by car from the current headquarters.
Patel has talked in recent months about relocating headquarters staff to other parts of the country, but Tuesday’s announcement seems to have put that talk on hold.
GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Michael Peters said in a statement that move to the Reagan building avoids more than $300 million in deferred maintenance cost the current FBI headquarters.
“We are proud to partner with Director Patel to drive efficiency and improve the quality of space for a productive workforce in service to national security and taxpayers,” Peters said.
According to its website, the Reagan Building is home to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until recently, it was also home to the U.S. Agency on International Developement, before that agency was gutted by the Trump administration and closed as an independent agency effective Tuesday, presumably freeing up space in the building.
But the building also has 22 event spaces to host weddings and events. Plans are scheduled for two events Wednesday, and a concert series on a plaza starts Monday and continues through September.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the Greenbelt site, called Tuesday’s decision “very interesting.”
“That [Ronald Reagan] building is a very open building. I’ve gone there for private events and conferences,” Williams, who chairs the county’s delegation in the House of Delegate, said in an interview.
“I still maintain that the Greenbelt site is the better location for the relocation of the FBI. It’s disappointing to hear the administration trying to undermine what was already done through the official GSA process,” she said.
“Congress has already appropriated funds for the purpose of the construction of the new FBI headquarters in Maryland. Now the administration’s attempting to redirect those funds really undermines congressional intent,” Williams said, echoing arguments of Team Maryland.
Williams and her two Democratic District 22 colleagues – Dels. Anne Healey and Ashanti Martinez – sponsored legislation that went into effect Tuesday directing the governor to include $200 million in the state budget “for site redevelopment and to improve transportation infrastructure for the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters relocation project.”

This year’s holiday seems especially important to lift up at a time in which President Trump continues to trash guardrail after guardrail in an unprecedented bid to exercise autocratic one-person rule.
One leader who should be especially attuned to this situation and the need for strong action to curb Trump’s ambitions is North Carolina U.S. Senator Thom Tillis.
Earlier this week, Tillis took the honorable path of voting against Trump’s disastrous mega-bill and then announcing he will not seek reelection next year. And this presents him with a unique opportunity for independence from the Trump machine in the 18 months he has left in office.
The bottom line: With both houses of Congress divided by razor-thin margins, Senator Tillis’s declaration of independence gives him the chance to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina in decades. One prays he rises to the challenge.

Vice President J.D. Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, applaud behind. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A provision in the new state operating budget that would eliminate Ohio’s Medicaid expansion group may not see the light of day, based on the federal budget just passed by Congress.
But even with the expansion group surviving budget talks, impacts to Medicaid in Ohio are still on the horizon from the budget reconciliation bill, according to analysts and advocates.
The state operating budget was passed at the end of June and signed by Gov. Mike DeWine on June 30. The budget included a provision that DeWine himself had written into his executive budget proposal, and which survived a Senate and House vote, along with joint conference committee debate in the Statehouse.
That provision would eliminate the state’s Medicaid expansion group, also called Group VIII, if the federal medical assistance percentage (or FMAP) for that group, which is the contribution Congress gives to the state to help with Medicaid, drops below 90%. If the FMAP drops even 1% on the group, the expansion would be dropped from the Medicaid rolls in Ohio.
But it seems the expansion group is safe for now, as congressional plans to lower the FMAP on expansion groups are specific to states who spend their own money to cover immigrants lacking “qualified status” under Medicaid. Immigrants without legal status are already ineligible for federally funded Medicaid.
“Despite early conversations and, kind of, conjecture, I think that advocates did a pretty solid job to make it clear that any changes to the FMAP would be devastating,” said Natasha Murphy, health policy director for the Center for American Progress.
Medicaid expansion came to the states as part of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded program eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level, an expansion that was bolstered by a Supreme Court decision. The expansion came to Ohio under Republican Governor John Kasich.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Ohio Department of Medicaid did not respond to a request for comment from the Capital Journal, but as budget discussions were ongoing in Ohio, Maureen Corcoran, director of the ODM, told the Senate Finance Committee that the “magnitude of Medicaid’s fiscal impact is not lost on the department,” and that at that point, no changes had been made at the federal level “that impact the Medicaid program, its funding or requisite services.”
But the language impacted by federal government funding changes would “protect the state from undue financial impacts.”
“This ‘trigger language’ ensures that Ohio can reduce, discontinue, pause or suspend any program if it is impacted by changes to federal funding,” Corcoran said in her April testimony.
Spending on health care services makes up 97.6% of the department’s budget, according to Corcoran, spending that is driven by rate increases that were adopted in the last state budget, the size of the department’s caseload and eligibility.
Anti-poverty advocates fought hard against the state budget provision, and have been watching the congressional budget debates closely, concerned for the more than 770,000 Ohioans who would be at risk if the expansion was taken away.
An analysis of the state budget by the Legislative Service Commission said that if the FMAP is set below 90% in either fiscal year 2026 or 2027, the state Medicaid department would be required to establish a “phased transition plan” to help individuals who are no longer eligible for Medicaid by “redirecting them to private insurance subsidies or charity care programs that provide medical assistance.”
One measure that was removed by the Ohio Senate before the final draft was approved would have established an “assessment” for hospitals and federally qualified health centers “to offset the cost of uncompensated care that may result from providing medical care to former members of Group VIII.”
  Cuts still coming to Medicaid 
Despite the fact that the expansion group may be safe, other elements of the congressional budget bill cut Medicaid funding in the state. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the reconciliation bill would reduce spending for Medicaid nationwide by more than $1 trillion, and nearly 12 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034.
“These cuts have triggered deep concern among leaders across the country about how (and if) hospitals, health care providers and state budgets can absorb such massive losses in revenue,” according to think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
There was one change made to expansion coverage, a provision that eliminates an incentive built into the American Rescue Act to encourage new states to adopt Medicaid expansion. But overall, Medicaid cuts would come mainly from adding work requirements to eligibility for the program and more restrictions on taxes states can levy against medical providers to fund Medicaid programs.
The provision to change taxes to medical providers was revised to comply with procedural rules. Now allowed into the federal budget bill, the measure would lower the hospital taxes expansion states can levy to 3.5%, rather than the previous 6%, starting in 2028.
Advocates are concerned about the impact Medicaid changes could have on hospitals, particularly already struggling rural hospitals.
Prior to the work requirements measure in the budget reconciliation bill, Ohio submitted a request to include a “pre-enrollment requirement” for the Medicaid expansion group specifically, at the direction of the legislature in its previous state budget. In order to implement new regulations, the state must ask for a waiver of a section of the Social Security Act. The waivers allow states to try “demonstrations,” or pilot projects, related to federally-support programs like Medicaid.
“The Medicaid program was created as part of a much larger legislative and social agenda and was a part of a war on poverty,” the Ohio Department of Medicaid wrote in their waiver application. “Central to this demonstration is the premise that this covered group is the quintessential safety net for those who need it while improving their situation and reaching independence.”
The state agency said the pre-enrollment requirement would “limit pathways to qualifying for this covered group.”
Under the state’s plan, Ohioans applying to be covered under the expansion group would have fall under at least one of the state-established criteria. Those qualified to enroll in the expansion must be at least 55; be employed; be enrolled in school or an occupational training program; participate in an alcohol or drug addiction treatment program; or have “intensive physical health care needs or serious mental illness,” according to the application.
While current federal law bars Medicaid eligibility on a work requirement, waivers like the one Ohio requested were approved for 13 states during the last Trump administration, according to KFF.
The budget reconciliation bill would flip current law and require at least 80 hours per month of work or certain other activities for individuals ages 19 to 64 applying for Medicaid coverage, including those in the expansion groups. Parents with children ages 13 and younger are exempt.
The U.S. House passed the budget on Thursday afternoon, sending it to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer but the second highest cookout cost since 2013, when the American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods, and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs, and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in that time.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are affected.
Since January, the U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.
 Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say

Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products.
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles.
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done — work hard, adapt, and provide for American families.”

President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget is called a “skinny budget” because it’s short on line-by-line details.

But historic preservation efforts in the U.S. did get a mention – and they might as well be skinned to the bone.
Trump has proposed to slash funding for the federal Historic Preservation Fund to only $11 million, which is $158 million less than the fund’s previous reauthorization in 2024. The presidential discretionary budget, however, always heads to Congress for appropriation. And Congress always makes changes.
That said, the Trump administration hasn’t even released the $188 million that Congress appropriated for the fund for the 2025 fiscal year, essentially impounding the funding stream that Congress created in 1976 for historic preservation activities across the nation.
I’m a scholar of historic preservation who’s worked to secure historic designations for buildings and entire neighborhoods. I’ve worked on projects that range from making distressed neighborhoods in St. Louis eligible for historic tax credits to surveying Cold War-era hangars and buildings on seven U.S. Air Force bases.
I’ve seen the ways in which the Historic Preservation Fund helps local communities maintain and rehabilitate their rich architectural history, sparing it from deterioration, the wrecking ball or the pressures of the private market.
 A rare, deficit-neutral funding model

Most Americans probably don’t realize that the task of historic preservation largely falls to individual states and Native American tribes.
The National Historic Preservation Act that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1966 requires states and tribes to handle everything from identifying potential historic sites to reviewing the impact of interstate highway projects on archaeological sites and historic buildings. States and tribes are also responsible for reviewing nominations of sites in the National Register of Historic Places, the nation’s official list of properties deemed worthy of preservation.
However, many states and tribes didn’t have the capacity to adequately tackle the mandates of the 1966 act. So the Historic Preservation Fund was formed a decade later to alleviate these costs by funneling federal resources into these efforts.
The fund is actually the product of a conservative, limited-government approach.
Created during Gerald Ford’s administration, it has a revenue-neutral model, meaning that no tax dollars pay for the program. Instead, it’s funded by private lease royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas reserves.
Most of these reserves are located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska. Private companies that receive a permit to extract from them must agree to a lease with the federal government. Royalties from their oil and gas sales accrue in federally controlled accounts under the terms of these leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue then directs 1.5% of the total royalties to the Historic Preservation Fund.
Congress must continually reauthorize the amount of funding reserved for the Historic Preservation Fund, or it goes unfunded.

Despite bipartisan support, the fund has been threatened in the past. President Ronald Reagan attempted to do exactly what Trump is doing now by making no request for funding at all in his 1983 budget. Yet the fund has nonetheless been reauthorized six times since its inception, with terms ranging from five to 10 years.
The program is a crucial source of funding, particularly in small towns and rural America, where privately raised cultural heritage funds are harder to come by. It provides grants for the preservation of buildings and geographical areas that hold historical, cultural or spiritual significance in underrepresented communities. And it’s even involved in projects tied to the nation’s 250th birthday in 2026, such as the rehabilitation of the home in New Jersey where George Washington was stationed during the winter of 1778-79 and the restoration of Rhode Island’s Old State House.
 Filling financial gaps

I’ve witnessed the fund’s impact firsthand in small communities across the nation.
Edwardsville, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, is home to the Leclaire Historic District. In the 1970s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The national designation recognized the historic significance of the district, protecting it against any adverse impacts from federal infrastructure funding. It also made tax credits available to the town. Edwardsville then designated LeClaire a local historic district so that it could legally protect the indelible architectural features of its homes, from original decorative details to the layouts of front porches.
Despite the designation, however, there was no clear inventory of the hundreds of houses in the district. A few paid staffers and a volunteer citizen commission not only had to review proposed renovations and demolitions, but they also had to figure out which buildings even contributed to LeClaire’s significance and which ones did not – and thus did not need to be tied up in red tape.

  The Allen House is one of approximately 415 single-family homes in the Leclaire neighborhood in Edwardsville, Ill. Friends of Leclaire
Edwardsville was able to secure a grant through the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office thanks to a funding match enabled by money disbursed to Illinois via the Historic Preservation Fund.
In 2013, my team created an updated inventory of the historic district, making it easier for the local commission to determine which houses should be reviewed carefully and which ones don’t need to be reviewed at all.
 Oil money better than no money

The historic preservation field, not surprisingly, has come out strongly against Trump’s proposal to defund the Historic Preservation Fund.
Nonetheless, there have been debates within the field over the fund’s dependence on the fossil fuel industry, which was the trade-off that preservationists made decades ago when they crafted the funding model.
In the 1970s, amid the national energy crisis, conservation of existing buildings was seen as a worthy ecological goal, since demolition and new construction required fossil fuels. To preservationists, diverting federal carbon royalties seemed like a power play.
But with the effects of climate change becoming impossible to ignore, some preservationists are starting to more openly critique both the ethics and the wisdom of tapping into a pool of money created through the profits of the oil and gas industry. I’ve recently wondered myself if continued depletion of fossil fuels means that preservationists won’t be able to count on the Historic Preservation Fund as a long-term source of funding.
That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a preservationist who thinks that destroying the Historic Preservation Fund would be a good first step in shaping a more visionary policy.
For now, Trump’s administration has only sown chaos in the field of historic preservation. Already, Ohio has laid off one-third of the staffers in its State Historic Preservation Office due to the impoundment of federal funds. More state preservation offices may follow suit. The National Council of State Historic Preservation Officers predicts that states soon could be unable to perform their federally mandated duties.
Unfortunately, many people advocating for places important to their towns and neighborhoods may end up learning the hard way just what the Historic Preservation Fund does.

The Declaration explained why the Thirteen Colonies at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states no longer under British rule. With the Declaration these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America 
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.–Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)If you drive up to a fireworks tent in eastern Kansas this week, the caricatured face of Eddie Shay might welcome you on a banner. 
“EDDIE’S FIREWORKS,” the sign will read. “LIGHTING WICKS SINCE ‘76.”
“I was lighting wicks way before that,” Shay says.
However, it was 49 years ago when he started selling fireworks, launching a family business that now uses his smiling face — hair escaping from a ball cap — as the logo. On the crown of the ball cap? A lit firecracker.
His children put his face on T-shirts, hats, banners and stickers without him knowing once they became part of the fireworks business.
One T-shirt places Shay on Mount Rushmore, between Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe, Thomas Jefferson and Shay all sport red, tinted sunglasses.
“That was a little embarrassing there for a while,” Shay said. “In fact, I’m wearing a hat with my face on it now.”
This column was not supposed to be about Eddie Shay. I was almost done writing a column about the fireworks code in La Cygne — the municipal code that audaciously allows you to light your fireworks from 6 a.m. to midnight for nine days surrounding the Fourth of July.
However, that really is all that you need to know about that story.
Shay’s tale is the one you need to hear. It was definitely the one I needed to hear as we celebrate America’s 249th birthday.
I called Shay because he owns a fireworks store in La Cygne. I thought he might have a quick comment about how the city allows so many days of fireworks.
I caught him at his house on a landline (“I don’t even carry a phone anymore.”). Two days before the holiday, he had stopped there to pick some tomatoes and zucchini from the garden.
Instead of a brief quote, I learned about Eddie’s love of fireworks — an emotional, generational love for a side business that he started while working as a rough-in carpenter. Our talk was interrupted a few times as he paused to dry his tears and grab a drink of water.
“I’m almost 78,” Shay said. “And here I’m crying like a baby.”
I asked how much longer he would work the grinding hours at summer fireworks stands.
“I don’t even know why I’m doing this,” Shay said, holding back tears. “I’m sorry.”
He took a long pause to compose himself before saying that he will probably let one of his children take over his part of the business.
He paused again, the tears welling. He continued, describing the families who visit the store without enough money to buy their kids the fireworks they want.
“There’s nothing like it. When there’s a family that’s kind of struggling in life, and when it comes to money and buying fireworks … I don’t know why I’m doing this,” Shay said, wiping away tears.
He continued: “Anyway, to hand that little person something they were really eyeballing a lot, and just give it to them. To me, that’s kind of Fourth of July. Yeah. The smile. The smile. And I don’t even know why that is emotional for me. I don’t know. But anyway, that’s the truth.”
  Eddie Shay’s face has become the logo for fireworks stands owned by him and his family. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of his first fireworks stand in 1976. (Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)
That feeling probably finds inspiration in Shay’s childhood. He told me how he was the fourth of 13 kids in his family, growing up in a two-bedroom house in the country. He remembers his dad making only $250 each month working for the county.
“The reason I get kind of emotional — I’ll get a grip on pretty soon — but I loved fireworks as a kid,” Shay said. “And we didn’t have any, hardly any at all. My parents would definitely wait till the Fourth so we wouldn’t shoot them off.”
Whether owned by himself or by relatives, locations for Eddie’s Fireworks have been outside Edgerton, in La Cygne, Gardner, Wellsville, Paola, Osawatomie and Spring Hill, plus other cities over the years, Shay said.
“I wanted my kids to have that neat, good, great feeling of shooting fireworks,” Shay said. “And so that I wouldn’t have to buy fireworks, I got involved in fireworks.”
He remembers his kids shooting off fireworks from his first stand and on their 20-acre farm in Linn County, far from livestock and other families.
“My kids, when they were little, they shot fireworks year round,” Shay said. “I’m talking little stuff — not the big stuff you’re hearing nowadays.”
His family seems astrologically drawn to the Fourth of July: His brother and sister were born on July 5, while his dad’s birthday was July 1. On Wednesday when we talked, he had just called his son to wish him a happy 49th birthday: July 2.
“My wife was running our first firework stand. Wow. How about that?” Shay said.
Selling fireworks has taught the next two generations lessons that are important to Shay. As we talked, his wife, daughter and two granddaughters were working at the stand.
“Oh my gosh,” he said. “My kids learned how to count money back. It’s not like you go into a store today and people give you money. They actually learned how to count money back to everybody.
“You go into places of business. It’s just kind of cold sometimes. In a business like this, you’ve got to be friendly. It just shines. People respect that. I just feel like if you treat people good … if you have a friendly smile and you’re treating people well and talking to them … I think you’re going to prevail.”
Shay remembers the amount he spent on his entire inventory of fireworks during that first year. That total is less than one of the deluxe fireworks that he sells this year.
“I’m still amazed,” Shay said. “It seems like every year things just keep getting better and prettier.”
To find new products each year, Shay visits trade shows and writes up a “cheat sheet” of products he wants to order.
“We got a lot of new stuff this year,” Shay said. “The different effects that I haven’t even seen before! That’s amazing.”
Even so, he still sells his favorite elaborate fireworks from years ago, ones named “Magic Show” and “Outrageous.”
“I’m old school, you know, and I don’t want things to change,” Shay said. “I’ve been through a lot since ‘76, I’ll be honest with you.”
He recalled summers during the 1980s, when the Kansas grass was so dry that you would start a fire just by throwing a smoke ball in the grass. He lost money one year.
“I was able to still pay the workers, but the fireworks sales were pretty nil that year,” he said. “And I swore after that, if there was ever another year that dry, I would never sell fireworks.”
He recounted how in some cities, there were squabbles over the cost of permits or the cost of renting land. Those politics drove him to sell fireworks elsewhere.
A year from today, Shay will celebrate two milestones: the 50-year anniversary of his business and America’s 250th birthday.
How much longer will Shay work in fireworks?
“I really don’t know at this point,” Shay said. “I really don’t know.”

Right around the Fourth of July, Americans pay renewed attention to the country’s crucial founding document, the Declaration of Independence. Whether Republican or Democrat or independent, some will say – with reverence – that adherence to the values expressed in the declaration is what makes them American.
President Barack Obama, in his second inaugural address, gave voice to this very conviction.
“What binds this nation together,” he stated, “is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.” What truly makes Americans American, he resolved, “is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago.”
The declaration still stands today as a manifesto. There are its lofty, “self-evident” principles, of course: that “all men are created equal” and that they are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” such as “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
But I’m a historian of the early republic, and I wish to remind you that the declaration doesn’t just go all pie in the sky. And it’s more than an academic paper waxing on and on about the fashionable philosophical doctrines of the 18th century – freedom and equality – or the coolest philosopher ever, John Locke.
The declaration provides a realistic depiction of a wounded society, one shivering with fears and teetering on the brink of disaster.
 Repeated injuries and usurpations

On June 11, 1776, the Continental Congress asked five of its members to prepare a text that would notify the British king and his Parliament of America’s firm intention to get a divorce.
The drafting committee comprised Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and a man who had a stellar reputation as a gifted writer, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
Jefferson didn’t waste time. He locked himself up in a rented room near the State House in Philadelphia, and within a couple of days he was ready to submit a draft to his four teammates for revision.
The committee was smitten by the clarity and effectiveness of the document. Other than suggesting a few corrections, Jefferson’s colleagues were elated by the text.
The Continental Congress promptly received the document, discussed it, made a handful of alterations, and in the late morning of July 4, 1776, adopted it.
Late that night, Philadelphia printer John Dunlap was given the historic task of issuing the first copies of the final Declaration of Independence.
In retrospect, all of this may sound like a tale of fearless heroes eager to break the chains of oppression and single-handedly affirm their boundless love of freedom.
However, when Thomas Jefferson took the pen in his hand, he didn’t think of himself as a hero. Rather, looking ahead at the immediate future and the drama that would inexorably unfold, he felt overwhelmed. A war, pitting brethren against brethren, the Colonists against their mother country, had already started.
The situation was tense and painful, because 18th-century Americans didn’t quite see themselves as Americans. They trusted they were active members of a powerful, expanding British Empire.
What had begun as yet another crisis over Parliament’s right to tax its overseas possessions had quickly transformed into a turning point over whether the Colonies should become independent.
As a consequence, readers of the declaration cannot escape the impression that this document carries a sense of reluctance, betrayal, fear and even sadness.
We Colonists thought we were free, the logic of the declaration goes, but now we are waking up to the dismal realization that the king and the Parliament treat us like their personal slaves.
Jefferson’s words appear to longingly express how wonderful it would be for “one people” not to be put in the condition to “dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another.” How desirable it would have been if a way to renew “the ties of our common kindred” could be found.
Unfortunately, what Jefferson calls “repeated injuries and usurpations” have created enemies out of a common ancestry, thus stifling the “voice of justice and of consanguinity.”
How not to grieve at these “injuries”? The king is guilty for “abolishing our most valuable Laws”; he has “excited domestic insurrections amongst us”; he has sent “Officers to harass our people”; he has obstructed “the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners”; and he has “made Judges dependent on his Will alone.”
Americans didn’t seek a revolution, the declaration concludes, but Colonists must accept “the necessity” of a separation: “Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.”
 ‘Forget our former love for them’

Americans today may believe that the Declaration of Independence belongs to them – which it does. The declaration is an American document.
But to an even larger extent, it belongs to Thomas Jefferson. It’s a Jeffersonian document.
One of the most consequential American philosophers, the author of the declaration poured into the text his theories of society and of human nature.
For him, human beings should not live as isolated atoms in constant competition against each other. Jefferson was a communitarian, which means that he believed that the very happiness voiced in the declaration could occur only when individuals regard themselves as functional parts of a larger whole made of other human beings.
The declaration was built upon the tenet that, as Jefferson would explain many years later, “Nature hath implanted in our breasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them, a moral instinct in short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succour their distresses.”
As a moral philosopher, Jefferson wasn’t perfect, obviously – and his views on race and slavery prove that. But the declaration puts forth the argument that the British king and the Parliament are also to blame for having transformed a united people, a people who used to love each other, into a mass of foreigners suspicious of each other.
In Jefferson’s account, this king has carried out the supreme betrayal – like tyrannical powers often do. He has stabbed the Americans as well as the British. He has split them into antagonistic parties. And we Americans, as Jefferson wrote in a telling passage of the declaration that didn’t survive revisions, “must endeavor to forget our former love for them.”
The American nation was born of the traumatic experience of an amputation. It’s a residual half of a former whole that one way or another managed to learn to become a whole again.
But after 250 years, America appears once more a people who seem to have lost what binds them together. Those “political bands which have connected them with another” are being tested; “the ties of … common kindred” are frayed.
Such words describe a time, centuries ago, of great uncertainty, fear and sadness. It seems America has arrived yet again at such a time.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

  April McNair, 45, is a resident of Greenville, Miss. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”


The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

  Jennifer Morris, 44, a Greenville, Miss., resident, poses for a photo at Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Becky Cover/ Georgia Department of Natural ResourcesWhile the well-known story that Benjamin Franklin wanted the wild turkey to be the national bird may be exaggerated, it is true that the founding father praised the wild gobbler’s virtues in a tongue-in-cheek letter to his daughter.
“For in Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of America. Eagles have been found in all Countries, but the Turkey was peculiar to ours,” Franklin wrote in 1784.

This Independence Day, Georgia Department of Natural Resources’s Bob Sargent says Americans should be grateful we wound up with the eagle on our greenbacks, on our politicians’ podiums and on soldiers’ patches.
“With all due respect to Ben Franklin, the wild turkey is a spectacular bird, but I don’t think there’s much that’s more majestic than the sight of a bald eagle soaring over a lake,” said Sargent, who is a program manager with the department. “So I think that it’s very much an appropriate symbol. The fierceness, the wildness, the size, the beauty of the bird, it’s rareness.”
“And America is a country that’s resilient,” he added. “We’ve come a long way since the 1700s when we were fighting for our independence. And the bald eagle likewise has come a long way since the days that it was an endangered species.”
Sargent is one of the few people who regularly see eagles from above – part of his job is to get out in a helicopter and take a census of eagle nests across Georgia.
“It’s just kind of an awe-inspiring experience to see Georgia from the perspective of 400 to 600 feet, because we cover so much of it, and to see a small piece of the private lives of these birds is just, it’s a gift, it’s a wonderful experience,” he said.
This year’s survey focused on the coast and the southern part of the state and found the birds nesting at average on the coast to just below average levels in the southern part of the state. Of 176 active nests, 127 were successful, fledging an estimated 190 eaglets.
Accounting for areas not monitored this year, Sargent said the numbers suggest Georgia has maintained over 200 nest territories a year for the past decade.
Sargent said a decline of successful nesting in southern Georgia over last year may be a result of storm damage from last year’s major hurricanes or a delayed impact from avian influenza, which hit eagles on the coast hard in 2022.
But he said the dip should not detract from the eagle’s huge success over the past five decades.
“The overall trend is very encouraging – 25 years ago, we only recorded 55 nest territories in the whole state and in the decade that was the 1970s there was only one successful nest recorded the entire 10 years,” he said. “So we’ve come a long way. Bald eagles in Georgia are still rare. It’s still listed as a threatened species under state law, but it’s going in the right direction. Since 2015, we know that we’ve had at least 200 nest territories in the state per year, so that’s very encouraging news.”
The state agency cites a 1972 federal ban on the pesticide DDT, which significantly weakens eagles’ eggshells, as a major factor in the birds’ recovery, along with the enactment of the federal Clean Water and Clean Air acts, protection through the Endangered Species Act, increased public awareness, restoration of local populations through release programs and forest regrowth.

Eagle earmarks
But Sargent said he is cautious about whether the federal budget cuts could inadvertently harm efforts to help eagles recover.
Funding for conservation programs for non-game species like bald eagles comes from something called the State Wildlife Grants Program, which is an annual congressional allocation.
“I sometimes have people say to me, ‘Your funding should be fine because it’s coming from hunting licenses,’ but that’s actually not true,” Sargent said. “We’re concerned about the future of the State Wildlife Grants Program. We’re monitoring that. Right now, it’s unclear what’s going to happen to that grants program.”
Georgia Wildlife Federation President Mike Worley said his group and others are lobbying members of Congress to keep that funding coming to states.
“It’s not a lot of money across the whole nation. It has been around something like $72 million. Georgia’s been getting about $1.6 million over the last few years for doing our work. And it’s really critical for the work that goes on here, whether it’s work on gopher tortoises or the bald eagle population that we’ve seen tremendous success and tremendous recovery with.”
While charismatic critters like eagles may get a lot of attention, plenty of lesser known plants and animals also need help, Worley said.
“It will be working on some darters in some of the streams in Georgia, some mussels that live in North Georgia streams – Georgia is one of the most biologically diverse states in the country, and we’ve got well in excess of 1,000 species that when we look across the state are in some degree of pretty significant concern,” he said. “And so the state wildlife action plan which identifies all of those and puts together a methodology for protecting them is really critical, and those state and tribal wildlife grants are the funding mechanism for that effort to recover the species.”

Brown/Maryland Matters).Maryland distributed more than $23 million at the end of June to help the families of more than a half-million low-income children afford food this summer while school is out.
The payments, $40 per kid per month, mark the kickoff of the second summer of the state’s Sun Bucks program, a newer federal grocery benefit that provides food assistance to families  struggling with food insecurity, helping them replace school meals that students in low-income families often rely on.
The program is expected to help about 579,000 children this summer.
“What Sun Bucks does is it puts groceries on the tables for families when our students are out of school during summer break,” Human Services Secretary Rafael López said in a recent interview. “We want to make sure that every kid, every child throughout the state of Maryland taps those resources for June, July and August.”
Lopez is excited to oversee the second year of Maryland Sun Bucks and continue last year’s efforts, when more than 600,000 Maryland kids received $120 over the course of the summer to help afford groceries, totaling to $72 million in benefits issued.
Hanging over his excitement, however, was the looming budget reconciliation bill that won final congressional approval Thursday. Among many cuts in the nearly 900-page bill is a $230 billion reduction in food assistance programs over 10 years.

For now, López said, Sun Bucks is funded for this summer, meaning that families in the program can count on getting Sun Bucks assistance for groceries through the end of August.
“Maryland Sun Bucks” is the kid-friendly name for the state’s Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer Program, which offers families $40 per month per child to spend on groceries when school is out. The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched Sun Bucks last year, and Maryland was one of dozens of states that volunteered to administer the program.
This year, Maryland is one of 37 states participating in Sun Bucks, along with Washington, D.C., several U.S. territories and tribes in Oklahoma.
Thousands of kids in low-income families lose access to free meals from their schools when students are released for summer break. Families often struggle to afford food to replace those meals during the summer months, leading to a phenomenon known as “summer hunger.”
“We know that a lot of kids receive the bulk of their meals during the school year,” said LaMonika Jones, interim president for Maryland Hunger Solutions. “Sun Bucks … are guaranteed ways that we can make sure that kids who reside in food-insecure households — that they’re able to receive that nutrition that they are not receiving in the same way that they would during the school year with school meals.”
Future of Sun Bucks threatened
Over 90% of families who qualify for Sun Bucks are enrolled automatically because they already qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or similar benefits. That makes the recently passed budget bill major concern for advocates and state officials.
Sun Bucks is not directly mentioned in the budget reconciliation bill. But advocates say increased eligibility requirements for SNAP, as well as reduced funding, will have ripple effects on programs like Sun Bucks.
“When you look at some of the provisions within the budget bill, knowing that SNAP is used to determine eligibility for Sun Bucks … we’re putting at risk these children that reside in SNAP households,” Jones said.
“For students that are automatically certified for Sun Bucks, we’re using their SNAP household data,” she said. “If those households are no longer eligible for SNAP, then that means we have a large number of students … that we now have to send through additional hoops and hurdles in order to feed their families during summer, when we know hunger is most challenging.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The budget reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign into law Friday afternoon, will also make running SNAP more costly for the state, which could further jeopardize funding for food assistance programs as the state tries to offset higher administration costs.
The Maryland Department of Human Services estimates that the bill would require $412.5 million more in state funds to operate SNAP at current levels. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill calls on the state to contribute up to 15% of SNAP funds, and 75% in administrative costs. Currently, administrative costs are shared 50/50 between the state and federal governments, and thefeds cover all of the funding for the benefit itself.
“What we’re looking at is having to balance the ability to administer these benefits and then take the cost of that – which unfortunately means that states will have to make a really hard decision,” Jones said, noting that some states like Texas already plan to end their Sun Bucks programs due to the increased costs of administering SNAP.
López says state officials are still “trying to get our head around these impacts.”
“They are massive. They will be felt across the state,” he said. That said, he noted that most of the cuts will not be felt until next year or later.
“It will take a little bit of time for those cuts to be experienced. But at the end of the day, they are still cuts to benefits for Marylanders,” López said. “This year, Sun Bucks are paid for. This year, SNAP benefits are paid for.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4578-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 02:59:54.794771

Jackson and county police said Zheng Hui Xie, 30, of Flushing, New York, and Jianwei Wang, 27, of Monterey Park, California, impersonated Federal Trade Commission officials in order to convince the resident, who was not named, that there had been fraudulent activity on her Apple ID and that several accounts were compromised.
The resident received a text message on April 28 about a large purchase made on her account, and called a number provided. The person who answered claimed to be with a fraud department, and transferred the woman to an individual who claimed to be an FTC agent.
On two separate occasions, the resident was asked to withdraw money from her bank in order to secure her money. She handed the money over to the fake agents who came to her home.
When the resident received another phone call May 15 from an unknown number, and was told to withdraw $24,000, she contacted police. On May 23, investigators with the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Financial Crimes Unit arrested Xie and Wang.

	Both men are charged with two counts of theft, one count of theft scheme and one count of conspiracy to commit theft. Police said the men could face additional charges, along with others who may have helped them defraud other residents in financial schemes that may have netted a combined $700,000.
Although senior citizens are mostly preyed upon in similar schemes, Jackson said scammers also target those who are “very responsible.”
“If somebody texts you and says, ‘If you don’t pay this money immediately, then your license is going to be suspended,’ most of us that are responsible don’t want our license suspended,” she said. “Our message to our residents and others is to make sure that you just don’t respond.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The Maryland General Assembly spent countless hours on energy reform this session, and emerged with a package of bills aimed at lowering customer costs.
But bills are still rising — and not only because of summer heatwaves — and a group of Baltimore policymakers and advocates called for more to be done Thursday.
The group, led by Baltimore City Council President Zeke Cohen, gathered outside Baltimore Gas & Electric headquarters and pressed the Maryland Public Service Commission to bring an end to multiyear rate cases, which let utilities apply for several years of rate increases at a time. The plans have “delivered record profits to Exelon shareholders at the expense of hard-working Baltimoreans,” Cohen said, referencing BGE’s parent company.
Del. Elizabeth Embry (D-Baltimore City) said the Next Generation Energy Act, passed this year, gave regulators the tools to address multiyear rate plans and excessive natural gas infrastructure replacements, which she called major contributors to higher bills. The act lets the PSC approve multiyear rate plans only if the utility “demonstrates the customer benefits of the investment.”
“We are now here asking for those tools to be implemented and for the spirit of that legislation to be respected,” Embry said.
A BGE spokesperson pushed back against the notion that multiyear plans were harming customers.
“All of the work we do, we do to benefit customers — full stop,” said BGE’s Nick Alexopulos.
If a utility receives approval on a multiyear rate plan, the new law does not let allow them to file for reconciliation after the fact, which would let them recover additional costs from ratepayers.
The PSC, for its part, is still evaluating the law, which only took effect June 1, and determining how to alter its procedures on multiyear ratemaking, Commission Chairman Fred Hoover said.

“Does it make sense to continue this? Does it make sense to continue it, but change it in some way? Or does it just not work?” Hoover said in an interview Thursday.
Before making a decision, the commission is likely to ask all affected parties — including utilities and the Office of People’s Counsel, which represents ratepayers — how they believe the language from the law should be applied, Hoover said.
Alexopulos, argued that Maryland is “not an outlier” among U.S. states because it allows multiyear rate cases, but said the process is fairly new to Maryland.
BGE filed its first multiyear plan in 2020, Alexopulos said. The process allows BGE to consult the PSC, and all other stakeholders, before it incurs costs — and ask for higher rates. Before that, BGE went to the PSC to ask for higher rates after incurring the costs, Alexopulos said.
“So, the multiyear plan the process itself adds transparency that didn’t exist before. And you know what the rates are going to be three years into the future,” he said.
In addition to ending multiyear plans, the group also called on BGE to cancel its 2026 rate distribution increase.
“We’re looking at folks who are deciding between groceries, rent or gas and electricity,” Cohen said. “And so, it is not a sustainable situation.”
Alexopulos argues that those increases fund “critical” upgrades to the system, which promote safe and reliable service. And Hoover said Thursday that the commission can’t intervene to reject that increase.
“We can’t go back and sort of adjust the rates in a retroactive manner,” Hoover said. “What we can do is say: ‘Well, in the future, you have to make this adjustment in what you’re charging.’”
Cohen attempted to deliver a bag of postcards Thursday that he said were from Baltimore ratepayers calling for BGE to end multiyear rate plans amid high bills. But a BGE employee who met him at the door declined the bag, citing security protocols. Alexopulous criticized Cohen for rejecting a meeting with BGE’s new CEO, Tamla Olivier.
“He declined, and instead decided to have a performative press conference about this issue rather than engaging in real conversation,” Alexopulos said of Cohen.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cohen said he declined the meeting because he felt it would not be productive unless BGE produced a plan for ratepayer relief.
“I don’t do meetings for meetings’ sake,” he said. “I want to see action from this company.”
At the PSC, just a few blocks from BGE’s downtown Baltimore building, Cohen received a warmer reception. Hoover accepted the bag, and highlighted the commission’s previous orders focused on lowering costs to ratepayers.
In late May, the commission ordered BGE to spread out an upcoming rate increase, caused in part by a historically costly electricity auction at PJM, which runs the electric grid for Maryland and about a dozen other states. The commission’s decision will lessen the impact higher prices this summer — when bills will increase due to high temperatures — and push it into the fall.
The PSC is also in charge of determining how utilities will dole out $200 million in state-funded customer rebates beginning later this summer. In June, Exelon announced $19 million in additional relief for low- and middle-income households, with $15 million going to BGE customers.
Most recently, the PSC changed the rules on extensions of the natural gas system, ordering that customers who request extensions must pay the cost themselves. That way, the rest of the customer base isn’t paying for extensions of a system that could eventually be phased out amid concerns about fossil fuel use and climate change.
It was a concern long voiced by consumer advocates. Hoover said it came down to a basic principle of rate-making.
“The economic principles say that the people that cause the cost are the ones that should bear it. And so that’s what we’ve applied in this situation,” he said.
Hoover said that won’t be the only order issued amid the commissions’ “Future of Gas” proceeding. More could be coming in the weeks ahead, he added.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HEADSHOT-136-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-04 00:59:55.966978

Walsh,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/04/our-nations-descent-into-social-darwinism/,"As I contemplate the passage of this bill, I am convinced that it is an alarming display of Social Darwinism -- that only “the fittest”  will survive.","J.D. Vance broke a tie in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that will support the wealthy and bring devastation to the lives of many Americans.  We know that the bill, now passed in the House and headed to President Trump for signing, will result in more than $3 trillion added to our national debt, an irresponsible consequence in itself. 
It will also result in over 17,000 individuals losing their health care, including many low-income and disabled persons, and many more losing benefits that will have a deleterious impact on their lives.  SNAP programs will be cut, affecting low income families and increasing food insecurity across the country.
Planned Parenthood, which generally provides the only preventative healthcare services in rural areas, as well an estimated 300 rural hospitals, and an unknown number of nursing homes throughout the nation, may be forced to close with the drastic reduction in Medicaid funding.  Veterans benefits have also taken extraordinary losses which will impact vets across our country, many of whom are already at risk with physical and mental health issues, addiction, and the risk of suicide. 
I’m not sure if I am more enraged by this heinous act which deprives individuals and families of the support they need, and which is a blatant betrayal of moral American values, or by the sordid measures which provide tax breaks to billionaires to enrich their wealth, and to support their greed and lust for power on the backs of middle and working class families.
As I contemplate the passage of this bill, I am more convinced than ever that it is an alarming display of Social Darwinism.  Yes, only those with personal resources, “the fittest” in our society, will survive these draconian measures, which raises another question of why legislators would approve such legislation.  The term is typically used to justify social inequities and competition according to common definition, which suggests that “the most successful in society are inherently superior, and others less successful, are naturally less fit.”  It is frightening to consider that this ideology has made its way into our democracy, indeed, into the halls of our government.
Prior to the vote in the Senate, the data clearly extrapolated the dire consequences of this bill on the American people. It is now reasonable to predict that millions will be denied social services and health care, mental health and addictions services, preventative care and treatment, palliative and elder care services, and disturbingly, that many will die. Yet, members of the U.S. Senate, knowing the consequences of their vote, voted to pass a bill that denies benefits to their constituents, rather than to betray loyalty to the president and risk retribution. In truth, they abandoned their constituents to preserve their political power.
We have seen the degradation of democracy in recent years, as well as a decline in moral values, and there are now unmistakable signs and patterns indicative of authoritarian rule.
We are witnessing a clear diversion from American values, that we are no longer a country committed to caring for the less fortunate.  There is no longer “the golden door,” the lamp to light the way, for “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”  America, wake up to what we have become.  Will you sit on your hands, complicit with all that is wrong, or will you take action now to restore kindness and morality to a country that has lost its way?

[…]","Gov. Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)In a meeting with Republican members of the Alaska House of Representatives on Wednesday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy had what he called an “unorthodox” request. 
He asked that the 19 members of the House’s Republican minority caucus stay away from the first five days of a special legislative session he called for Aug. 2 in Juneau.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the Legislature must vote to override or sustain a governor’s vetoes in the first regular or special session following the vetoes. If those Republicans are absent, it increases the odds that his vetoes will be sustained. 
An absence is as good as a “no” vote when it comes to getting the 45 votes needed to override a veto of line items in a budget bill or the 40 votes needed to override a veto of a policy bill.
In May, lawmakers voted 46-14 to override Dunleavy’s veto of a policy bill that permanently increases the state’s public-school funding formula. Eight of the 19 House minority members voted for the override.
Now, they’re being asked whether to override the governor’s decision to only partially fund that formula.
The governor’s opponents will have a difficult task. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, are expected to be unavailable for the special session. Dunbar has been deployed with the National Guard in Poland.
Others may have family commitments that are obstacles to attending. If minority-caucus legislators heed the governor’s request and avoid the special session, they will be largely immune to last-minute lobbying by their colleagues or members of the public.
“If you want the veto override to fail, when we’re talking about less than $50 million here on a multibillion-dollar budget, I guess you pull out every stop, and this is a stop that I’ve not seen pulled out by any governor,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham and a supporter of the override.
Reporters were not invited to the meeting between the governor and the House minority, but Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, confirmed the details, first reported by KTUU-TV.
“Governor Dunleavy asked house minority members to not show up for the first five days of session because like any governor, he does not want his vetoes overturned,” he said by email.
Dunleavy has designated education policy and the creation of a Department of Agriculture as the subjects of the special session. Turner said the governor planned to introduce an education bill for lawmakers to consider during the session.
“Arriving on the sixth day also means legislators begin the session with a clean slate for conversations on public education reform policies. The Governor is also willing to reinstate the $200 BSA increase, if he and lawmakers can reach an agreement on the education bill he will introduce next month,” Turner said.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, did not return a call seeking comment, but other members of the minority spoke freely about the governor’s request.
“I will use the governor’s exact word: Unorthodox. It was definitely an unorthodox request that took me by surprise,” said Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna.
While the governor’s official special session proclamation lists education and a proposed Alaska Department of Agriculture on its agenda, “he was very clear that a big portion of the strategy for him was, he did not want to be overridden on anything: bills, budget, all of it.”
Ruffridge voted in favor of the prior override and indicated that he’s willing to vote the same way in a special session.
“I’ve taken the approach sort of since day one, that if I vote yes on something, that my yes means something, I know that probably doesn’t always align with the political winds that might blow, but I think that’s something that my constituents at least respect,” he said.
Ruffridge said he absolutely intends to show up at the special session.
“If a special session is called, I think all representatives and senators have an obligation to attempt to be there, if at all possible,” Ruffridge said. “I think that’s part of what we signed up for when we signed up to do the job. And I mean, if you’re not going to show up, I think essentially, you’re just afraid of taking hard votes at that point.”
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, has a different perspective.
“I think that’s fine,” she said of the governor’s request. “It costs a lot of money. It’s $300 per diem per day. You have to pay for flights and hotels. I think it’s a good idea. Those who do want to continue to override, they could go ahead and go down there, and those of us who don’t, it’s an automatic no vote for us when we don’t go there to vote.”
“My job is to make sure we save as much money as possible,” she said. “And again, if we’re not in Juneau, it’s an automatic no vote. If you show up in Juneau, then I believe those individuals are going to be voting yes or wasting taxpayer dime.”
Jeremy Bynum, the Republican representative from Ketchikan, said he intends to show up in Juneau on Aug. 2, even though it means missing Ketchikan’s largest annual celebration, the blueberry festival.
He’s interested in attending the special session because he hopes that legislators will take up education policy, even though he doubts that will happen. 
The multipartisan House majority caucus controls the legislative agenda, and it isn’t clear that there is sufficient common ground between the majority and the governor to enable progress.
Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said she’s still considering her options and is undecided about whether to travel to Juneau.
Before the House minority’s meeting with the governor, Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said he doesn’t see the governor’s call for a special session as significantly different from legislative committees’ attempts to advance or derail legislation by using legislative procedures or schedules. He pointed to the way that the Senate Finance Committee has used take-it-or-leave-it tactics with regard to the state budget.
Rep. Elexie Moore of Wasilla said she’s likely to attend in order to vote against an override and to sustain the governor’s veto.
Earlier this year, she was absent from the Capitol on a day that unexpectedly brought a key vote on the Permanent Fund dividend. 
She was dragged on social media for three weeks afterward, she said by phone. 
People expect their legislators to be in the Capitol, she said, and most people aren’t able to follow the maneuvering that might explain an absence.
“I think that’s the perspective of somebody who doesn’t understand what it means not to go,” Allard said when told about Moore’s thinking. “(Not attending the session) means that you’re a no vote. But if she wants to go and spend, you know, $5,000 to $10,000 in taxpayer money, that’s fine. I understand she was dragged on social media, but those were some bad decisions that were made — not necessarily by her — but on information about what she was doing. But I would recommend that she stay with the caucus and don’t go down there.”
“I think it’s a good idea,” said Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole, about the governor’s request. 
Prax supports the governor’s position and said he believes the special session is a good idea, because it settles the school funding issue early. Without a special session, lawmakers would have to wait until January to decide whether to override or sustain the governor’s decisions.
The Fairbanks North Star Borough school board voted in June to finalize a budget that expects lawmakers to override the governor.
If an override fails, Prax said, it’s better that it fails early, so the district can change its budget before school begins.
While members of the House and Senate majority caucuses have indicated that they intend to take up only the veto overrides during the special session, Prax said he hopes lawmakers will stay and consider education policy.
While lawmakers have convened an education task force to discuss future changes, he doubts the effectiveness of that group, given the Legislature’s failure to adopt the recommendations of a prior fiscal policy working group. The task force deadline to make recommendations is January 2027, after the next election.
“I am not at all optimistic that there’s even any intention, frankly, of the task force coming up with something,” he said.
Edgmon, the House speaker, said that his recommendation “to any legislator, is to show up to Juneau, get their work done and make the tough vote whether they are a yea or a nay.”
Legislative rules allow any lawmaker to issue a “call on the House” that compels legislators to attend. Edgmon said that might be deemed dilatory and out of order in this case.
In the end, will absences even matter? Lawmakers who stay away are likely to be those most likely to support the governor.
“That could be the case for sure,” Edgmon said, “and it’ll be the voters in their districts that will judge whether or not they’re doing the right thing.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s administration has blocked the release of an estimated $6.2 billion in congressionally approved education funding through U.S. Department of Education grant programs, including what one group estimated to be $46.4 million appropriated for Alaska schools. 
The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development confirmed Thursday that the federal department notified states that grants would not be dispersed July 1 as expected, including:   

​​Migrant Education — to improve educational opportunities for migratory children to help them succeed in the regular school program;
Supporting Effective Instruction — to increase student achievement, and improve the quality and effectiveness of instructors;
Language Instruction for English Learners — to help ensure that English learners, including immigrant children and youth, attain English proficiency and develop high levels of academic achievement in English;
Student Support and Academic Enrichment — to provide all students with access to a well-rounded education, improve school conditions for student learning, and improve use of technology; and
21st Century Community Learning Centers — to provide competitive grants to organizations that are working in partnership within their community and schools to provide expanded learning and enrichment opportunities for children and their families outside of regular school hours.

DEED did not respond to an interview request, or more details on how much was currently frozen from each program, by Thursday afternoon. 
According to federal budget data compiled by the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan education research nonprofit, Alaska is facing an estimated $46.4 million in grants withheld by the department, or 15% of total federal funds for K-12 education. 
That includes $21.3 million for migrant education, $10.8 million for supporting effective instruction, $1.1 million for English language learning, $6.6 million for student support and academic enrichment, and $6.5 million for 21st Century community learning center programs, according to the LPI data analysis.  
The Trump administration has left states and territories to face severe budget shortfalls and potential disruptions to summer school and enrichment programs.
Bryan Zadalis, a public information officer with DEED, said by email on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Education has indicated the delay is part of a broader review process by the Trump administration. 
“While no timeline has been provided for when funds will be available, the Department has emphasized its intent to ensure decisions are aligned with federal priorities and statutory responsibilities,” he said. 
“At this time, we are not able to provide specific guidance on how this delay may impact district-level planning or program operations,” Zadalis said. “However, DEED is actively monitoring the situation and will be prepared to take advantage of any flexibility or waiver opportunities that may be offered.”
Anchorage Democrat Sen. Löki Tobin, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, condemned the move by the Trump administration. 
“It is absolutely abhorrent and disgusting to me, the continued insidious, quiet and now very loud attack on the fundamental right for every child to be able to access a quality education,” she said in a phone interview Thursday.
Tobin said that the move to block the dispersal of federal funding hits Alaska schools, including her district of Anchorage, especially hard. DEED is considering a rule change to limit local contributions to schools, saying that it’s necessary to comply with a federal disparity test. That issue could cost school districts millions of dollars.
“Add on to that now this impoundment of federal dollars for migrant ed, and special education services, and English language learning programs, and 21st Century school learning programs. Anchorage is again looking at another $15 million loss,” Tobin said. 
Officials with the Anchorage School District — which educates nearly 43,000 students — sent a letter to staff shared with the Beacon saying they are assessing the delay and impact to the district, and in the meantime “a hiring freeze is in effect for positions funded (in part or in whole) by these programs until our financial outlook becomes clearer.” 
In addition, Tobin pointed to Alaska school districts grappling with severe budget deficits following Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a portion of per student funding earlier this month. This week he announced a special session in August pushing up a promised veto override vote by the Alaska State Legislature.  
Tobin said the changes amounted to “undermining a core, foundational pillar of the American economy and the American ethos. That every child has a right to learn to read. Every child has a right to become a thriving community member. Every child has a right to prosperity. This is denying opportunity to an entire generation, and they should be ashamed.”

Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for the town. Now, she said, President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill could snatch it away. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”
The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.

Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.


– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System


Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.

“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”
Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

On Thursday afternoon, Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang, for the third time, issued an order to enforce the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in November. In her previous orders, one in December and one in February,  Zhang pointed to the voter-approved constitutional amendment in issuing a temporary injunction blocking abortion restrictions enacted over numerous years by state lawmakers.
State lawmakers have passed a ballot measure asking voters  to repeal the abortion rights amendment in 2026, a move being challenged in Cole County Circuit Court.
Surgical abortions resumed after the February decision but ended in May when the Missouri Supreme Court struck down Zhang’s orders on technical legal grounds. 
In a joint statement, the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood affiliates said the Kansas City clinic will resume abortion services on Monday. The statement said the ruling was incomplete because it did not enjoin enforcement of a state law requiring complication plans for abortion patients. 
“Abortion is legal again in Missouri because voters demanded it and we fought for it,” said Emily Wales, president and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. 
Zhang found that the total ban on abortions that took effect in 2022 clearly conflicted with the rights secured by the abortion amendment, which received 52% of the vote in November.
She also blocked enforcement of a law requiring two appointments 72 hours apart to obtain abortion services and that women be required to take state-produced material on fetal development.
The order blocks enforcement of laws requiring special abortion facility licensing and that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. 
“The regulations require physicians to perform certain exams and tests that are unnecessary when the physicians themselves are authorized and enabled to make the determination on what is and is not necessary for their individual patients,” Zhang wrote. “Additionally, miscarriage management can be provided on an outpatient basis without a special facility license.”
Zhang’s order keeps in place rules that only doctors can provide abortion services and that the woman seeking an abortion have an in-person appointment. The appointment can, however, be by telemedicine, Zhang ruled as she blocked a separate rule.
Overall, Zhang’s ruling means the rights secured by the abortion amendment can be exercised. 
“As plaintiffs argue, they and their patients are suffering serious harm, whereas defendants only stand to lose the ability temporarily to enforce some laws that are likely to be held unconstitutional and which further no valid compelling state interest,” Zhang wrote.
In a statement, Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office said in a statement that he would immediately appeal the decision.
“We respectfully but firmly disagree with the Court’s decision to once again block the enforcement of Missouri’s duly enacted health and safety regulations,” the statement read. “These requirements were designed to ensure that women receive care in sanitary conditions from qualified professionals, with emergency safeguards in place.”
While services will resume in Kansas City on Monday, other clinics will open up appointment books quickly.
“This decision is a step forward toward fully realizing Missourians’ right to reproductive freedom,” Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said in the release, “and the staff at our Central West End health center in St. Louis will work as quickly as possible to resume scheduling abortion appointments.”

“The ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is deeply concerning. I don't think it's beautiful,” said Mike Del Trecco, president and CEO of the state’s hospital association.

The sweeping Republican tax and spending bill that cleared the U.S. House Thursday could cause about 45,000 people in Vermont to lose health insurance in the coming years, state officials say. The bill is now heading to President Donald Trump for a sign-off.
In order to pay for key parts of Trump’s domestic agenda included in the legislation, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” GOP budget-writers are counting on proposed cuts to Medicaid, the shared federal and state program that funds insurance for people with low incomes.
Meanwhile, the bill has sparked concern among hospital leaders in Vermont over a provision that would limit how much state governments can tax health care providers such as hospitals to, ultimately, access more federal Medicaid funding. Vermont, like most other states, relies on these taxes to fund expanded benefits for Medicaid recipients, which is a practice that helps support providers, too.
“The ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is deeply concerning. I don’t think it’s beautiful, and I think it’s super harmful to Vermont,” said Mike Del Trecco, the president and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, in an interview earlier this week. 
President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in Congress have said the legislation would target waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid funding and have pointed to how the cuts would pay for policies such as breaks on taxes for tips and overtime pay. However, critics point to a Congressional Budget Office analysis showing the bill would boost the incomes of the country’s wealthiest households while costing the country’s poorest households more. 
The legislation would result in about 12 million people across the country losing their health care coverage over the next decade across Medicaid and the commercial insurance marketplace, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan agency that scores the fiscal impacts of federal legislation.  
One key provision in the bill would impose new requirements that certain people on Medicaid demonstrate that they are working in order to receive coverage. States will also be required to determine a participant’s eligibility for Medicaid every six months rather than every year, as they do now.
The fact that more people will have to fill out additional paperwork will lead some to fall off of coverage, according to Ashley Berliner, director of Medicaid policy for the state Agency of Human Services.
Berliner, in an interview, estimated that about 30,000 Vermonters will lose coverage because of that greater administrative burden. That makes up roughly half of the adults in Vermont who currently receive health insurance coverage under the expansion of Medicaid provided by the Affordable Care Act. That act, commonly called Obamacare, has significantly increased the number of people able to access health insurance.  
Federal spending for those 30,000 people would equate to $205 million annually that would, as a result of the bill, no longer be coming into the state, Berliner said. 
Meanwhile, she said, Vermont health officials believe an additional 15,000 people who purchase coverage on the commercial marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act will also lose coverage, at least in part because signing up for it will become more difficult. The budget bill doesn’t allow people to automatically reenroll in their current health care plan and shrinks the sign-up period for coverage by a month. 
Historically, only about half of people respond to the agency when it requests additional information to verify people’s eligibility to be enrolled in Medicaid, Berliner said. 
“When you ask people for additional information, they don’t fill it out and they fall off — the burden becomes too high and coverage is lost,” she said, adding that the picture is similar across the country, and GOP leaders are relying on the dropoff to help facilitate their proposed cuts.
Officials are also concerned about the impacts of a measure in the bill that would whittle down a long-standing mechanism states use to raise additional funds for Medicaid services by taxing health care providers. The rate of Vermont’s so-called provider tax, which is the name for that mechanism, would be reduced by 2.5% between 2028 and 2032. Vermont’s rate is currently set at the highest level allowed under existing law.
Cumulatively, over the period ending in 2032, Vermont is set to lose around $211 million from this change, counting both a loss of state dollars and additional federal Medicaid funding those dollars would allow the state to bring in, according to Berliner.
Hospitals will also feel pain from lost funding under these reductions, Del Trecco said.
Berliner added that she’s concerned by a measure in the bill that would ban state Medicaid payments for at least one year to health care nonprofits that offer abortions. This would include, notably, Planned Parenthood, which has clinics throughout Vermont.
One additional fallout, she said, could be shifting the costs of the reproductive healthcare those nonprofits provide in Vermont onto other providers. 
All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation have criticized the impacts of the budget bill and voted against it. 
Last week, before the Senate approved a version of the bill, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released a report that his office said showed the bill would increase the number of uninsured people in every state in the country. In some states, the rate of uninsured people would nearly double.
The legislation would “devastate rural hospitals, community health centers and nursing homes throughout our country and cause a massive spike in uninsured rates in red states and blue states alike,” Sanders said in a press release last week. 
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., speaking on the Senate floor earlier this week, derided the potential impacts the bill would have on states with all political leanings.
“I want to repeat here: this is the bipartisan infliction of pain. This is real. This is real. And is the tax cut — largely directed to the very wealthy people — is it worth inflicting that kind of pain on so many, when the tax cut benefits so few?” he said. 
Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., voted against the bill Thursday when it was up for final approval. 
“This Republican budget is far and away the cruelest piece of legislation I’ve seen in my career,” she said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “It’s an utter moral failure.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before his arraignment on federal charges. (File photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A federal judge presiding over the criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Tennessee has ordered lawyers to refrain from making public statements about the case.
Thursday’s order by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw came at the request of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, who argued that government officials had “launched a public disparagement campaign against” their client that violated standard court rules and could prejudice his chance at a fair trial.
The defense attorneys cited a string of statements by members of the Trump administration that variously labelled Abrego Garcia a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “barbarian.”
“From the moment Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia challenged his illegal rendition to El Salvador in March 2025, the government has repeatedly maligned him in public statements,” the attorneys wrote.
“Mr. Abrego is entitled to a fair trial,” they wrote. “But he is nearly certain to be denied that right if the government, left to its own devices, stays its current course.”
Crenshaw’s one-sentence order, issued in response, said, “All counsel are expected to comply with the local rules of this court.”
Court rules prohibit making public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.”
Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal

The rule applies to attorneys and “the government agencies or offices … and employees of such … government agencies or offices, with which the lawyer is associated.”
Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly dispatched to a Salvadoran prison as part of a larger Trump administration illegal immigration crackdown.
Court documents filed Wednesday in a separate immigration case in Maryland alleged Abrego Garcia endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there.
He was later brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia participated in a scheme to transport migrants who illegally entered the United States to points around the country.
Abrego Garcia, who has no past criminal history in the United States, has entered not guilty pleas to the charges.
The former federal prosecutor who conceded Abrego Garcia had wrongly been sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador was later fired. He has subsequently filed a whistleblower complaint that alleges his termination was, in part, related to his public admission of the government’s administrative error in the high-profile case.
Abrego Garcia is due back in a Nashville courtroom July 16 for a hearing that could determine if he is released from federal custody pending trial.
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys concede Abrego Garcia will almost certainly be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should he be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who maintain control over federal pretrial detainees.
Abrego Garcia, 29, entered the United States illegally from El Salvador as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge issued an order preventing U.S. officials from deporting him to his home country, where Abrego Garcia said he feared gang violence.
A federal magistrate in Nashville initially granted Abrego Garcia’s release last week.
But defense attorneys, citing conflicting statements by the Trump administration about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed from the United States before trial, have asked he temporarily remain jailed in Nashville.

The nearly 1,000-page legislation extends tax cuts, slashes safety net spending, funds immigration enforcement and rewrites the federal approach on health care, economic development and climate policy. It contains much of President Trump’s domestic agenda.
All 10 Democrats in Washington’s congressional delegation voted against the measure. The state’s two House Republicans voted for it. Here’s a flavor of their reactions and statements after the bill won final approval in Congress, clearing the U.S. House, on Thursday.
House Republicans
U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner
This bill isn’t a silver bullet. But it’s a bold, serious step toward getting our economy back on track and restoring real accountability. It’s a win for every American who wants safer streets, stronger communities, and a government that finally puts them first.

U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse
We made a commitment to reduce government spending, keep taxes low for hard working Americans, and make reforms to federal assistance programs to ensure their long-term sustainability. This is by no means a perfect bill, but it delivers on our commitment. This was a hard, thoroughly considered vote that I believe will benefit the people of my district.

This bill has become so big and bloated that my colleagues have lost the plot. Everyday families will come out in the negative, while Wall Street reaps the real benefits. It’s one of the largest explosions of our deficit ever from a single bill. It was designed to shirk responsibility, with many of these harmful provisions only going into effect after the midterm elections.

U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal
The Big Bad Betrayal Bill is the largest ever transfer of wealth from poor and working people to the richest, and every single district and state—red, blue, and purple—will feel the effects. This is a cruel, horrific betrayal that will leave Americans poorer and sicker. Thanks to Trump, Republicans, and this bill, people will die.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Adam Smith
This bill is one of the most reckless and cruel legislative efforts I’ve seen in my career. These cuts aren’t about balancing the budget — this bill actually increases the debt and deficit by trillions. These cuts are about handing more power and more money to the wealthiest Americans while punishing working people. It’s cynical, it’s dangerous, and it’s wrong.

U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene
Republicans made one fundamental promise to Americans – they would lower costs. This big, ugly bill is the ultimate betrayal of that promise. It will make America more expensive by taking away health coverage, increasing hunger, and raising energy bills for millions of households. At every opportunity to show courage and stand up for their constituents, they always fall in line behind Donald Trump.

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier 
As a pediatrician, I have seen firsthand how access to Medicaid can protect and even save the lives of children. The passage of this Republican bill means that essential healthcare will be ripped away from hundreds of thousands of people in Washington State who rely on Apple Health.

U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen 
Let’s make no mistake. The big, ugly bill is not about deficit reduction. It’s not about cutting spending. It’s about cutting spending in order to pay for tax cuts for the richest Americans and largest corporations. I’ll be fighting to rebuild the social safety net that it is destroying.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray
Republicans chose to ignore every warning about how terrible this bill really is and force it through, over the objections of Democrats and even members of their own party, for no other reason than because Trump said so. In the end, the American people will have their voices heard and will show Republicans exactly how they feel about this monstrous bill at the ballot box.

With the House green lighting President Trump’s goal of taking away health care access and food security for millions, many Americans are going to suffer, and many working families will see their costs go up.

(Cassandra Glaspie, LSU/Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium)
Imagine you love cherry cheesecake, and you’re happy to find out that your local bakery makes the delicious, decadent dessert every Saturday. But they only make a certain amount per week; after that, there’s no more. 
Your neighbors also love cherry cheesecake. So, in order to get more for yourself from the limited supply, you pay them not to order a cake on Saturday, giving their share to you instead.
Balancing the amount of cheesecake consumption using this kind of trade works in a similar way to water quality trading, which looks to reduce pollution in the environment— in theory. It gets a lot more complicated than cheesecake.   
“One entity removes certain pollutants from the environment, and then a company that discharges that pollutant could buy those credits to offset their pollution,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental group Healthy Gulf. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) hopes to improve water quality throughout the state with a new water quality trading program, using a market-based strategy to encourage less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in waterways. 
It’s a type of plan that environmentalists, scientists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says can be a useful tool. But whether the program is fully set up for success isn’t yet certain.
 
Nutrient pollution
Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients often found in things like fertilizer for agriculture or a product of wastewater treatment. Farmers, wastewater treatment companies and other types of facilities produce nitrogen and phosphorus as a byproduct; that byproduct often gets washed or dumped into nearby waterways.
Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water can cause  toxic algae blooms, areas of low oxygen also known as dead-zone and acidification of coastal estuaries and wetlands, among other problems 
The dead zone in the upper Gulf of Mexico, now renamed the Gulf of America by the Trump administration, is the “poster child” for the issue, said Rota. The area of low oxygen that appears every summer in the Gulf from nutrient pollution in the Mississippi River covers an area usually about the size of Delaware. 
“It’s a really important issue, the zone of hypoxia,” said John Sabo, professor at Tulane’s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, and director of the Tulane ByWater Institute. Low oxygen in the water can kill fish, shrimp and other sea life, affecting Louisiana’s seafood industry and the ecology of the Gulf. 
Previous efforts to reduce it haven’t made much progress. Vast amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus wash into the Mississippi River from further North in the Mississippi River Basin. All of that runs down to Louisiana, making it hard to control that much pollution within a single state. 
The Hypoxia Task Force, a group of federal agencies, states and tribes throughout the Basin, represents one of the larger groups trying to address the dead zone by forecasting and mapping the annual size of the zone. It also works with farmers to adopt new strategies to reduce the amount of nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and works with universities and businesses to advance technology to contain nutrient runoff. 
The goal of the Task Force is to reduce the dead zone’s size by 20 percent of what it was in 2015 by this year, and no larger than about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Forecasts for this year predict the zone to be about 4,800 square miles. 
Problems with fully funding the annual cruise to gather data on the true size of the zone could also make it harder to tell whether reduction strategies are working. 
 
Problems in the program
The idea behind  LDEQ’s market strategy is that Louisiana can use financial incentives to reduce nutrient pollution and help alleviate problems like the dead zone.
“The goal is to reduce pollutants across the state,” said Rachel Mathews, LDEQ environmental scientist manager and the program lead for the water quality trading initiative. 
 But environmental advocates noted some gaps that could hinder the program’s success. 
Louisiana doesn’t currently have numeric limits for nutrient pollution in waterways. Having a specific, measurable number is important for keeping a market working correctly, according to Rota and Sabo. 
Certain individual permits from “point source” polluters, or places like wastewater treatment plants and manufacturing facilities, might have a measurable maximum they are allowed to dump, but Louisiana has no broad, standard requirement for these facilities to limit nutrient pollution. 
Other sources of pollution, called “nonpoint source” pollution, like that from farming fertilizer runoff, do not have any requirement to limit nutrient pollution in Louisiana. 
“If their permits aren’t requiring them to ramp down their nitrogen or phosphorus discharge, there’s no market,” said Rota.“Louisiana hasn’t put together a good regulatory regime to ensure that these credits would need to be purchased.”
It’s like the local bakery making cheesecake all week in unlimited amounts; there’s no incentive to pay your neighbor not to get a cake if you can eat as much as you want. 
Louisiana started the process of developing numeric maximums for the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus allowed in bodies of water in 2003, mutually agreeing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to finish a draft of nutrient criteria for all waterways except the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers by 2013. Rota said that goal still hasn’t been met.
“Louisiana has theoretically been working on those for 20 years. And, you know, we have seen very little progress,” said Rota. 
Mathews said Louisiana does follow a “general narrative criteria,” or more qualitative descriptions like good, bad, moderate or severe, for maintaining the amount of nutrient pollution in the state’s waters.
“It’s a good start, the narrative approach, but it should be evolved towards quantitative and measurement,” said Sabo. 
LDEQ also does a water quality assessment every two years to see if bodies of water are “supporting” or “not supporting” the narrative requirements. Mathews said that can help LDEQ decide if certain, more heavily polluted areas need to be a higher priority for cleanup. 
“It was just the most efficient tool that we had available at the time,” said Mathews.
But relying on numbers is central to making a program like this successful. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office looking at water quality trading programs found that without limits on the amount of nutrients allowed into waterways, there’s no demand for point source polluters to buy credits.
Getting nonpoint source polluters involved was another issue the report cited, because it’s so difficult to tell how much nutrient pollution they actually produce, creating “uncertainties about the value of credits.”
 
Can it be fixed?  
Even with the problems in Louisiana’s program, environmental advocates and scientists alike agree that trying a market strategy to control nutrient pollution isn’t a baseless idea. 
“I love working with the market rather than against it,” said Cassie Glaspie, assistant professor in Louisiana State University’s Department of Oceanography & Coastal Sciences.   
Still, she said there’s a need for regulation to play a role. 
“I usually get excited about these types of things, but I also know from experience that regulation has to be part of the talk,” she said. “Having some sort of nutrient pollution credit, I think, would be an important tool to help that, but it’s not going to solve the issue on its own.” 
Sabo said that expanding from a program solely in Louisiana to one encompassing more states in the Mississippi River Basin could be a good way to start making actual, substantial impacts in reducing problems like the dead zone. 
“Starting at home makes a lot of sense, because you can’t incentivize market participation between Iowa and Louisiana very easily, but if you have your own market set up, that’s a good pilot for something larger,” said Sabo.
While Mathews didn’t expand on specific plans for future expansion into the Basin, she emphasised the importance of Louisiana trying new and varied ways to tackle the overwhelming problem of nutrient pollution. 
“Who knows where we’re gonna go from here? We just have to get one thing done before we can move to anything else,” said Mathews.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dead-zone-research-cruise-noaa-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-03 20:06:13.079394

Republican to oppose Trump’s budget bill,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/economy/brian-fitzpatrick-only-pa-republican-to-oppose-trumps-budget-bill/,"Fitzpatrick voted in favor of an earlier version of the bill that passed the House, but opposed the amended version that returned from the Senate.","U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican whose district includes all of Bucks County and part of Montgomery County, talks to reporters in 2023. (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)After weeks of debate, Republicans in Congress managed to pass a massive spending bill containing many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities.
Broadly, the bill includes a slew of tax cuts and increases to defense and immigration enforcement spending, which is partially paid for with cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Still, the bill is projected to add more than $3 trillion to the country’s debt during the next decade.
Debate over the bill threatened to split the Republican caucus, with deficit-wary hardliners decrying its price tag and others warning of the impacts of cutting social services like Medicaid and food assistance. Ultimately, the final version of the bill passed mostly along party lines, with three Republican senators and two Republican House members joining every Democrat in opposing the final legislation.
The only Pennsylvania Republican to oppose the bill was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-01), a moderate representing the Philadelphia suburbs.
Fitzpatrick voted in favor of an earlier version of the bill that passed the House, but opposed the amended version that returned from the Senate. It included even steeper cuts to Medicaid than had already been proposed. 
“I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle-class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief and for historic investments in our border security and our military,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement after the Thursday afternoon vote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.” 
The bill’s Republican defenders see it differently.
“This bill delivers on the promise I made to the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing the largest working-class tax cuts in American history, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime and securing the southern border,” said Rob Bresnahan (R-08), who represents Northeast Pennsylvania. “We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste and abuse that is driving the program toward collapse. This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities, and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.”
According to an analysis of census data by KFF, a nonprofit focused on health policy research, 92% of Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, attending school, or not working due to caregiving, illness or disability. 
Nearly 12 million Americans could lose health insurance when the bill’s provisions take full effect, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services estimated a previous version of the bill could have resulted in 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and another 270,000 losing access to government-backed Affordable Care Act plans because of the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. The version of the bill that passed Thursday made even steeper cuts.
Primarily, Medicaid cuts are accomplished by implementing strict work requirements and reporting mandates. Medicaid recipients will have to prove they’re working or volunteering at least 80 hours a month if they are not children, elderly, disabled, seriously ill, in recovery or caretakers of children under 14. They will also have to certify their eligibility at least twice a year or risk losing benefits.
Previous efforts to implement similar work requirements in Georgia and Arkansas resulted in tens of thousands of people who should have qualified for the program becoming uninsured.
The bill also sets new limits on how much states can tax health care providers like hospitals to help pay for their Medicaid programs, reducing the top rate from 6% to 3.5% by 2032.
The Department of Human Services says the move could cost them $2.7 billion in tax revenue and federal matching funds when the change takes full effect.
The bill also cuts the federal share of SNAP funding in some cases, shifting some of the burden of paying for the food assistance program to states for the first time. Alaska and Hawaii aside, states with error rates above 6% — meaning the frequency that they underpay or overpay recipients — will have to fund between 5% and 15% of the program themselves. 
Pennsylvania’s error rate was 10.76% in 2024, slightly below the national rate of 10.93%
Gov. Josh Shapiro has said repeatedly in recent weeks that Pennsylvania does not have the money to make up for lost federal funds for safety net programs. 
“Shame on these members of Congress  who spent the last few months saying, ‘Oh, I’ll never cut Medicaid,’” Shapiro told WILK radio Thursday morning. “This is just crazy that they’re voting to knock poor people off of this assistance. Why? Because they wanted to give a huge tax cut to people at the highest income level.”
The cuts led to concerns about the financial impact on rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid dollars to stay afloat. To offset that, the Senate inserted a provision creating a $50 billion fund for them.
The biggest expenses in the bill are tax cuts. It extends the first Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts that were set to expire; it makes good on Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay; it extends the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200; and it raises the SALT tax deduction cap, which allows people to deduct a portion of local taxes paid from their federal filings, from $10,000 to $40,000.
There are also new tax cuts for businesses that will allow them to write off additional expenses. However, many tax cuts for green energy projects passed under the Biden administration will be eliminated.
The bill includes $350 billion in new spending for national security and immigration enforcement, including $46 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, $45 billion for migrant detention facilities and $30 billion for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
Another $25 billion will go towards developing a country-wide missile defense system Trump has referred to as the “Golden Dome,” named after Israel’s “Iron Dome” that was built with U.S. assistance.
The CBO estimated the version of the bill that passed the House primarily benefited the wealthiest Americans, while costing the poorest.
Factoring in cuts to safety net programs, the poorest 10% of households are expected to lose around $1,600 per year, while middle income households will gain between $500 and $1,000 and households in the top 10% of income levels will gain about $12,000 annually.
Despite his ultimate opposition, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already hammered Fitzpatrick for voting on the initial version of the bill. Then, it passed the House on a 215-214 vote, where a single flip could have held it up. 
 “Now, Fitzpatrick is trying to cover his tracks because he knows that his vote to advance massive cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires will end his career, ” Eli Cousin, a DCCC spokesperson said in a statement.
While Fitzpatrick has held onto his seat since 2018, his district voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rep-Brian-Fitzpatrick-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-07-03 20:06:13.079394

What would John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson say to the relentless attacks on our democracy from an administration that is focused on tearing down the pillars of our country?
The post The Founders would say fight for democracy appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","DURING THESE TUMULTUOUS times when our democracy is being turned upside down by an administration showing the worst side of what government can do, I picture our nation’s Founders and what they would make of today’s America.  
What would John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson say to the relentless attacks on our democracy from an administration that is focused on tearing down the pillars of our country? 
As we prepare backyard barbecues in time for our Fourth of July celebrations, we need to remind ourselves the “why” of this national holiday.
Commemorating the birthday of the United States and the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, this cornerstone of our democracy declared,  in no uncertain terms, separation from Great Britain.  
The document was signed by 56 delegates of the Second Continental Congress,  including five from Massachusetts: John Hancock, famously the signature on it, John Adams, who was instrumental in drafting it, Samuel Adams, a key figure in the American Revolution, Robert Treat Paine, a prominent lawyer and politician, and Elbridge Gerry, a merchant and diplomat. These Founding Fathers would be appalled at recent infractions of “certain unalienable rights” on display for the world to see. 
The infractions continue to come at us at a furious pace in a relentless display of callousness from the White House. The public humiliation of elected officials; the suppression of free speech; the overreach of the government using executive orders to trample civil rights and human rights; the demonization of the media; the obsessive focus on Harvard University and foreign students across the country; the attacks on immigrants; the attacks on anything related to diversity, equity and inclusion; the marginalization of the Black community;  the targeting of LGBTQ individuals, especially the trans community; rolling back health care programs for vulnerable populations; and dismantling US humanitarian aid to countries across the globe who are facing humanitarian crises. The list goes on and on.  
Every day there are new attacks on our basic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Unfortunately, the chaos brought on by the Trump administration is becoming a daily occurrence, the norm. We wake up each day and wonder, are we still living in the United States of America? 
President Trump’s grip on the Republican Party, and their control of both chambers in Congress, has made it difficult to effect any change to what the Trump administration is doing. Many Republicans may privately disagree with Trump campaign promises that benefit the select few and remove protections from those Americans who need it most, but vote for bills that contain these policies out of fear of political retaliation.  
They’ve stood idly by while the Trump administration cancels vital, congressionally mandated programs, yielding their constitutional “power of the purse.” And those Republicans who choose to stand up and call foul – those who participate in true policy discourse – are forced to retire from Congress.  
Recently, there was a very disturbing altercation involving a US senator, Alex Padilla from California, who was handcuffed and thrown to the ground in a foreboding fashion because he appeared at a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. She was there to tell the media how the Trump administration was going to “liberate” the city from the Democratic mayor and governor.   
Padilla was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech. He is a US senator elected by his constituents in California, a son of Mexican immigrants who graduated from MIT with a degree in mechanical engineering.  
Padilla recently wrote an  essay in The New York Times denouncing the Trump administration’s tactics to suppress opinions and speech of anyone with whom they don’t agree. 
He also cited the recent removal and arrest of New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, who was trying to protect a migrant worker from federal agents. “Today it’s immigrants on the receiving end of Donald Trump’s outrage machine,” Padilla wrote. “Tomorrow it could be anyone.”   
The Declaration of Independence references despotism in citing the colonists’ fight with the British Crown. 
It feels like we are experiencing despotism under the current administration — the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and abusive way. Padilla says what’s happening in Los Angeles is a warning shot but also a wake-up call – that “true liberation doesn’t come through military occupation; it comes from democratic participation.” 
What would Adams, Hancock, Franklin, and Jefferson say? Keep up the fight,  because there are no kings in the United States. 
Thomas P. O’Neill, III is CEO of O’Neill and Associates, a Boston-based government relations and public affairs firm. He is a former Massachusetts lieutenant governor.

But some cost-cutting measures, like Medicaid changes, will take a couple of years.","President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping bill that is set to become law on Friday will have wide-ranging implications in Connecticut and across the country on everything from taxes to health care to nutrition assistance.
Many of the tax breaks and provisions will go into effect pretty quickly or in the near future. But some of the cost-cutting measures to pay for the bill will take a couple of years before they kick in, like the most significant changes to Medicaid.
Parts of the bill will be permanent, including the 2017 tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration that were set to expire at the end of this year. That includes lower income tax rates as well as the lower corporate tax rate. But some relief will only last for a few years, like deductions on overtime pay and tips on federal income taxes.
Many of the provisions line up around upcoming elections. Some of more generous tax relief, which could give Republicans a boost in their reelection efforts, won’t expire until after the 2026 midterm elections when control of Congress is up for grabs.
And the reforms to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that could lead to cuts — that Democrats, who all voted against the bill, have warned about — won’t apply until late in Trump’s term and close to the 2028 presidential election.
What taxpayers will see in the near term and when provisions will expire
A number of new or modified tax deductions and credits will go into effect this year, though many are set to expire after a few years. That relief will go toward families, children, tipped workers and seniors, though lower earners will not benefit as much.
The bill modestly and permanently raises the maximum amount of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child under the age of 17 and requires at least one parent to have a Social Security number. Those with lower incomes will not benefit as much because they make too little and the tax credit is not fully refundable.
Changes to state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of Connecticut’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
The 2017 tax bill placed a cap on SALT deductions at $10,000. The new legislation raises it to $40,000 and would get phased out for those who make over $500,000, starting in the 2025 calendar year. The cap would increase by 1% each year starting in 2025 through 2029. It would then go back down to the current threshold in 2030.
Workers will be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, though there are limitations to the amount of the deductions and which workers qualify. The deductions related to tips are capped at $25,000 a year, while workers can deduct up to $12,500 on overtime pay. That relief phases out for those who earn over $150,000 a year or $300,000 if filing jointly.
And taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans if the car is new and assembled in the U.S. All three of those tax deductions would take effect in 2025 and last through 2028.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction that will start in the 2025 tax year and run through 2028. The full deduction will apply to those who individually earn under $75,000 a year or $150,000 for couples. It starts to phase out above those income thresholds and cuts off at $175,000 or $250,000 if filing jointly.
The bill will automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. The federal government will contribute a one-time infusion of $1,000 and then allow parents to contribute $5,000 a year up until age 18 that can be invested in the stock market. The secretary of the Treasury will automatically open an account if a parent doesn’t establish one.
On energy, the bill will wind down some of the clean energy tax incentives that were implemented during the Biden administration in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act soon, while others will take a few years.
Tax credits to make homes more energy efficient as well as electric vehicle rebates will go away by the end of the year.
While some of the Medicaid provisions will take a few years to set in, people will see more immediate effects related to the enrollment process for the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies. Starting next year, there will be requirements to verify an enrollee’s income and immigration status instead of automatic re-enrollment.
What will go into effect over the next few years
States like Connecticut will need to implement big changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, in the coming years. Some states could be eligible for delays in implementation.
One of the biggest implications of the bill will be on states’ finances as they take on more of the costs associated with these safety net programs. That could have a domino effect on how states fund and structure the programs and lead to reductions in benefits or changes to eligibility standards. 
Both programs will institute new work requirements for certain beneficiaries in order to be eligible, while states will take on new costs that were once covered by the federal government.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children 14 and older.
Exemptions will apply to certain groups including parents, guardians or caretakers of children 13 and under or who are disabled, veterans with disabilities, those who are “medically frail” or have serious medical conditions and those who are pregnant. Recipients will now need to prove they are eligible twice a year, instead of once.
This would go into effect on Dec. 31, 2026 at the earliest, though states can apply for a waiver to give them until the end of 2028 to comply with the new requirements.
Almost 950,000 people are enrolled in Connecticut’s Medicaid program known as HUSKY, according to DSS. About 73% of Connecticut adults on Medicaid were working either part-time or full-time, according to a KFF analysis of the 2023 American Community Survey.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000.
From 2028 to 2032, it also lowers Medicaid provider taxes, which enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government. This change will apply to states that expanded Medicaid, which Connecticut did after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
Nearly all states use such taxes to increase what they get for Medicaid. Connecticut has levied a provider tax that collects hundreds of millions annually from hospitals then redistributes those funds, plus more, back to the industry. Those return payments technically count as public health care spending and help Connecticut qualify for federal Medicaid grants.
States depend heavily on the federal government to help pay for Medicaid. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projected Connecticut would spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025. The federal government contributed about 59% of that funding, which is about $6.9 billion.

Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said she fears people will decide it’s too cumbersome to comply with the requirements and be forced to find coverage that’s higher cost or lower quality. DSS oversees HUSKY and SNAP.
“We believe they’re just going to be so frustrated and so ground down by the process that’s already quite complicated in its current form,” Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror on Thursday. “Their health will suffer and we’ll see really bad effects as a result.”
Stricter work requirements will also apply to some SNAP recipients, with similar exemptions to the ones in the Medicaid provision. About 69% of Connecticut households on SNAP already have at least one 18- to 55-year-old member working, according to DSS.
Now, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month to receive SNAP. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it also applies to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
States may also need to pick up some of the costs associated with SNAP benefits for the first time in the nutrition program’s history. The federal government has always paid 100% of the benefits and equally shared the administrative costs with states.
Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will need to keep their payment error rate below 6% in order for the feds to keep paying for all costs associated with SNAP benefits. Those error rates take into account overpayments and underpayments.
But if it’s higher, states will have to take on anywhere from 5% up to 15%. And they will also need to pay more of the administrative fees starting in fiscal year 2027.
Connecticut’s payment error rate was about 10% in 2024. Based off of that number, the state would hit the top of the threshold and pay 15% of SNAP benefits. But that number will change since Connecticut’s share will be determined by the payment error rate from either fiscal year 2025 or 2026 — and the state can choose between the two. States may be able to delay implementation for another year or two.
In Connecticut, more than 400,000 people got SNAP benefits in 2025, according to the DSS. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $894 million in SNAP benefits. The average benefit for each household member per month was about $190.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Waiting for President Donald Trump to deliver his remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Iowa Republicans celebrated the passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through Congress Thursday.
The event on the fairgrounds Midway was the launch of a yearlong celebration leading up to America’s 250th anniversary through the organization America250, which also planned the Washington, D.C. military parade in June.
Speaking to reporters, Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said “aside from politics, this is a big deal that he’s starting in Iowa” for the year of events, saying he was hopeful the event and others planned throughout the country will lead to people coming together for patriotic celebrations.
“This is a really big deal for Iowa,” Kaufmann said. “… I know it’s very political, I know it’s going to be very combative, you know, today, in terms of when we talk policy – I get that. God bless America. But there’s got to be moments during this next year when we can take a time out for just a bit.”
While the gathering was officially linked to the country’s anniversary, much of the discussion at the event was centered around the passage of the tax and spending budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and was sent to Trump’s desk earlier Thursday.
Kaufmann thanked Trump and Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for voting in support of the measure, saying the measure was “not only … beautiful, it’s the right thing to do.”
The bill, which passed the House in a 218-214 vote is the controversial measure that would implement Medicaid work requirements, shift more funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from the federal government to states, and extend the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term. It also provides more than $170 billion in funding for the federal government to carry out mass deportations and raises the national debt limit by $5 trillion.
 Trump said he plans to sign the bill into law Friday, July 4, while military planes fly overhead.
“We’ll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads,” he told reporters before getting on Air Force One to head to Des Moines Thursday.
Lori Coltrain, a Des Moines resident who came with her granddaughter to the event, said she wanted to “hear the truth” from Trump about the bill and other policies advanced by his administration.
“I just hate all the negativity about it,” Coltrain said. “People should just celebrate that he’s actually gotten it through.”
Though many attendees spent several hours Thursday afternoon with temperatures above 90 degrees, spirits were high among many who were excited to hear from the president following the successful passage of one of Republicans’ major policy proposals.
Keith Reicks of Ridgeway said he was excited to hear from the president and Iowa Republican leaders about bringing the bill to the finish line. He said he was not concerned about the protests and public opposition from Democrats and others about the legislation – and said he trusts Trump to sort out any unexpected issues that could be caused by the measure.
“I think if something turns up, Trump will straighten it out,” Reicks said. “It seems like he always does. And I believe in the man. When I was younger, I didn’t think too much of Donald Trump, because I always thought he was a pusher, but now I’m glad he’s pushing.”
He also said he does not believe the discontent with the bill and some Trump policies will result in major Democratic gains during the 2026 election, saying Democrats are more focused on “complaining” about Republicans and Trump than putting forward their own ideas.
He said Iowans and most Americans still support Trump and believe he is doing a good job in the White House.
“I think he’s doing a good job,” Reicks said. “I’d vote for him again if he was running, but I don’t think he’s going to.”
Though the crowd of Trump supporters spoke largely in favor of the bill and the Republican trifecta’s work since the 2024 general election, other Iowans have rallied against GOP leaders’ actions. Protests were planned outside the State Fairgrounds for Thursday, the latest in weeks of actions calling for Iowa’s delegation to oppose the budget reconciliation bill.
Kaufmann called for Republicans to stand strong in support for the measure despite widespread opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
All four of Iowa’s U.S. House members – Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra – voted in support of the bill. They, alongside  Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, flew with Trump to Iowa on Air Force One following the House vote. 
Trump hinted in a Truth Social post Tuesday he planned to talk about “some of the GREAT things he had already done on trade, especially as it relates to Farmers.” 
Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set a baseline 10% tariffs on international imports, while he set a 90-day pause shortly after the announcement; they are set to go into effect on July 9. 
In Iowa, many farmers, local businesses owners and agricultural producers have expressed concern that they will be unable to absorb the added costs of the tariffs leading to disruptions for their business and higher costs to consumers. A study by Farmers for Free Trade found tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by 304%, roughly $68 million, from April 2024 to April 2025 and are set to increase going forward. 
Trump said he plans to begin sending letters to countries Friday dictating tariff rates.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 22:36:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Officials say viral video is pushing ‘inaccurate’ claims about hydrilla spraying in CT,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/diquat-hydrilla-ct-river/,CT officials and advocates say the negative social media posts are misleading and harmful to a project that has taken years of planning.,"In their efforts to combat the spread of a highly-invasive weed along the Connecticut River, scientists, conservation groups and public officials say they’ve had to confront a new problem that grows with even more alarming speed: online misinformation.
Their concern stems from a viral campaign that sprang up this week in opposition to an ongoing project by the Army Corps of Engineers to use chemical herbicides to halt the spread of hydrilla, an invasive plant that has taken over wide swaths of the river since it was first identified in the state in 2016.
In posts on social media and opinion pieces, critics have accused government officials of planning to “poison” rivers in Connecticut with the chemical diquat dibromide. Others have raised suspicions about the timing of project itself, which is scheduled to begin again after the July 4 holiday. 
While officials acknowledge the use of diquat, they say it is being done in compliance with state and federal regulations following lengthy studies along the Connecticut River itself.
“We appreciate the strong interest in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ efforts to combat the spread of this invasive and highly transmissible strain of Hydrilla,” Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District, said in a statement Thursday. 
“The threat of this strain to the Connecticut River’s natural ecology are real, and include degradation of river habitat and water quality, and harm to native plants and animals,” he added. “Additionally, the strain could affect the local economy through the loss of waterway navigability and fishing, lowering of property values, and increase in flood risk.”
Much of the attention to the project in recent days appears to have come from a series of social media posts made by Chris Webby, a Connecticut-based rapper who boasts more than 128,000 followers on X. In one video posted last weekend, Webby referred to the officials behind the project as “scumbags” and “filthy crooks.” The video was later shared by another account with more than 1 million followers.
An online petition circulated later by Webby has gathered 14,868 signatures as of Thursday.
When contacted Thursday about his posts, Webby said that he was “not an expert” on hydrilla or herbicides, and that he had done much of his research using ChatGPT after coming across social media posts by a man claiming to show the effects of diquat spraying on a lake in Texas.
That research led Webby to discover that diquat is banned in the European Union, and that it can have toxic effects on other aquatic plants and wildlife besides hydrilla.
“My question is, ‘Why diquat? Why the hold up after the fourth [of July]?'” Webby said in an interview Thursday. “Why now? Why all these places? We have questions. I’m not the only one.”
But public officials and local advocates who have worked for years with the Army Corps to combat the spread of hydrilla say that answers to each of those questions, and others, are available to anyone who has taken the time to ask them.
“It’s unfortunate that this really serious problem had to come to light through misinformation and conspiracy theories,” said Alicea Charamut, the executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, a non-profit conservation group. 
Responding to Webby’s questions about why officials don’t look at using other, mechanical means to combat hydrilla, Charamut said they did consider using a device known as a “benthic mat” that prevents the plant from growing up from the river bottom. That proved impractical, she said, because of the speed at which hydrilla grows and the fact that the mats would also smother other, native plants.
“You’d have to cover the entire river in mats. It just doesn’t work,” she said.
Jeremiah Foley, a research scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station’s (CAES) Department of Environmental Science and Forestry, said the timing of the project is dictated by the life cycle of hydrilla. Infestations of the plant typically reach their peak in late summer, when they create dense mats that can crowd out native species, clog boat propellers and even block access to parts of the river.
The purpose of the project, he said, is to disrupt the plants before they reach their peak and begin spreading small sprouts, known as turions, that form into new plants the following year.
Allies of the project also bristled at Webby’s assertions that the use of diquat is being carried out in “secret” without public input. The reality, they say, is the Army Corps spent years studying the use of herbicides and holding public meetings to devise the best methods of fighting hydrilla without harming the broader ecosystem.
“Some of the stuff I read was that it was quietly passed, nobody knew, or they’re trying to get money for their programs … I mean, that’s really not based in reality,” said Bill Lucey, the Long Island Soundkeeper at the environmental non-profit Save the Sound.
In 2023, Foley began working with the Army Corps to conduct experiments using dyes to study the flow of water in areas where they planned to use herbicides. By watching where the dyes went, he said, researchers gained a better understanding of where to apply the smallest amounts of herbicides necessary to attack the hydrilla.
“A lot of people have the misconception, when you put a chemical in the water, it is just flowing out of the system everywhere, and that is absolutely not the case,” Foley said. 
Based on the results of those studies, the Corps decided last year to move forward with a plan to begin applying herbicides, including diquat, in five areas along the river. Before doing so, officials held three public meetings in towns along the river to present the plans, and Foley said he and other researchers conducted a inventory of all the aquatic vegetation within the selected sites so they would be able to go back later and see what was left.
“What we find is that many of those native plants that we recorded not only were still there, but [were] increasing in abundance,” Foley said. “At the same time, those invasives that we were targeting, principally hydrilla, are knocked out of the system.”
Foley’s experiments using dyes drew notice from national outlets such as the New York Times, which published an article on those efforts nearly two years ago. The actual treatments using herbicides were carried out in a series of demonstrations last summer that were open to the public, according to notices published last year by the Army Corps.
Last month, the Army Corps published another notice of its plans to expand the project to a dozen additional sites this summer along the Connecticut River, its tributaries, and one lake and a pond. The Corps also opened a public comment period on its plans, which remains open through July 13.
Foley said much of the work this summer at the new sites will likely be limited to conducting dye tracing experiments before crews can even attempt to apply herbicides.
Hannon, in an email Thursday, said the Army Corps does not yet have the state permits necessary to conduct its proposed herbicide applications this summer, and will publish an updated schedule of its plans once those applications are in place. An official with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said in a statement that the agency has been “in touch” with the Army Corps regarding their plans to ensure that officials comply with all applicable state laws and regulations.
Christine Palm, a former state lawmaker from Chester who championed many environmental causes — including the establishment of CAES’ aquatic invasive species program — was among those who spoke out against Webby’s viral claims this week. 
“He does not have credibility in the scientific world or in the environmental advocacy world,” Palm said. “He has wreaked havoc on years of thoughtful, careful, expert work.”
In response to those criticisms, Webby said he had reached out to officials at the Army Corps and DEEP and never heard back. He added that suspicions about the project have been validated by the feedback he’s received from others online.
“I’m not saying this is not being done for a reason. I’m saying I don’t like the sound of it,” Webby said. “It sounds like a lot of other people don’t like the sound of it.”
Charamut, with the Rivers Alliance, said she understands the public’s fear over the use of herbicides, which her group has fought to limit in the past. But the aggressive nature of hydrilla — which has spread as far north as Massachussetts — has left officials with no other viable alternatives, she said.
One positive that has resulted from the sudden attention to the project, she said, is an increase in calls to the Rivers Alliance from people asking about hydrilla and methods to combat it. 
“People should be asking questions. This process was set up to give people that opportunity,” Charamut said. “But get your answers from trusted sources… not a rapper on the internet.”

If approved by a judge, the payment would resolve a lawsuit in which the estate of the late Kenneth Johnson alleged racism, negligence and medical malpractice led to his death at the Newport prison.

The estate of a Black man who died in a Vermont prison more than five years ago has agreed to accept $1.5 million to resolve a lawsuit brought against the state’s former medical provider alleging that racism, medical malpractice and negligence led to the man’s death.
Details of the proposed resolution were included in recent court filings in the case in U.S. District Court in Burlington arising from the December 2019 death of 60-year-old Kenneth Johnson at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport.
A court filing by attorneys in the case, titled a “Stipulated Order of Judgment,” still needs the approval of Judge Christina Reiss, who has presided over the case. 
The filing seeking the order of judgment to resolve the claims differs from a straight out settlement. 
“It’s a judgment, and that’s an important distinction,” said James Valente, an attorney representing Johnson’s estate. 
Confidentiality provisions are often part of settlements resolving litigation between private parties. A judgment, on the other hand, is a matter of public record.
“Our client had reservations about a settlement that would include a confidentiality provision,” Valente said Thursday. Olynthea Johnson, Kenneth Johnson’s sister, is the administrator of his estate. 
Shap Smith, an attorney for Centurion Health, the state’s contracted medical provider for prisons at the time of Johnson’s death, declined to comment Thursday. 
The lawsuit filed in December 2021 alleged that Johnson died in the prison infirmary after workers for Virginia-based Centurion Health failed to diagnose and treat a tumor that led to Johnson’s death by asphyxiation.

The wrongful death and medical malpractice lawsuit also alleged Centurion Health discriminated against Johnson, a Black man, due to his race. 
According to the suit, Johnson endured “extreme pain and suffering” and “extreme psychological distress” in the hours before he died. The suit accuses guards and medical staff of ignoring his pleas for medical help.
Initial reports from the Vermont Department of Corrections at the time said  it appeared Johnson died from natural causes. A person who was incarcerated with Johnson told Seven Days a week after Johnson’s death that he had been having difficulty breathing and begging for medical care before he died. 
Later, investigations, including the one by the Vermont Defender’s General’s Office, blasted the corrections department and Centurion medical staff over the care provided to Johnson. 
A court filing by Centurion’s attorneys stated that the health care provider has made an offer of $1.5 million to the estate. “This offer of judgment includes all amounts that might be recovered by the estate for any damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and pre-judgment interest,” the filing said. 
The offer of judgment, the filing added, was “not to be construed as an admission of liability by any defendants, or any official, employee or agent of Centurion of Vermont.”
In a separate court filing this week, the estate accepted the offer. As of Thursday afternoon, the judge had yet to sign off on the proposed order of judgment, according to court filings.
Valente, speaking Thursday afternoon, said he believed that the judge would sign off on the order. If the judge does so, the lawsuit would be resolved. 
Johnson’s estate had previously reached a settlement with the Vermont Department of Corrections, which had also been named as a defendant in the lawsuit, for $150,000, according to Valente and a corrections department spokesperson.  
That $150,000 payment is in addition to the $1.5 million the estate would receive from Centurion.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A federal judge presiding over the Tennessee criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has ordered lawyers to refrain from making public statements about the case.
Thursday’s order by US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw came at the request of Abrego’s attorneys, who argued that government officials had “launched a public disparagement campaign against” their client that could prejudice his chance at a fair trial and violated standard court rules.
The defense attorneys cited a string of statements by members of the Trump administration that variously labelled Abrego a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “Illegal predator,” “Illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “barbarian.”
“From the moment Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia challenged his illegal rendition to El Salvador in March 2025, the government has repeatedly maligned him in public statements,” the attorneys wrote.
Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal

“Mr. Abrego is entitled to a fair trial,” they wrote. “But he is nearly certain to be denied that right if the government, left to its own devices, stays its current course.”
Crenshaw’s one-sentence order, issued in response, said: “All counsel are expected to comply with the local rules of this court.”
Court rules prohibit making public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.” The rule applies to attorneys and “the government agencies or offices . . . and employees of such . . . government agencies or offices, with which the lawyer is associated.”
Abrego was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly dispatched to a Salvadoran prison as part of a larger Trump administration illegal immigration crackdown. 
Court documents filed Wednesday in a separate immigration case in Maryland alleged Abrego endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there.
He was later brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges. Prosecutors allege Abrego participated in a scheme to transport migrants who illegally entered the United States to points around the country. 
In a reversal, judge keeps Kilmar Abrego in jail over deportation concerns

The former federal prosecutor who conceded Abrego had wrongly been sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador was later fired and has subsequently filed a whistleblower complaint that alleges his termination was, in part, related to his public admission of the government’s administrative error in the high-profile case.
Abrego, who has no past criminal history in the United States, has entered not guilty pleas to the charges. 
Abrego is due back in a Nashville courtroom July 16 for a hearing that could determine if he is released from federal custody. 
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys concede Abrego will almost certainly be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should he be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshalls, who maintain control over federal pretrial detainees.
Abrego, 29, entered the United States illegally from El Salvador as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge issued an order preventing U.S. officials from deporting him to his home country, where Abrego said he feared gang violence.
A federal magistrate in Nashville initially granted Abrego’s release last week. 
But defense attorneys, citing conflicting statements by the Trump administration about whether Abrego could be removed from the United States before trial, have asked he temporarily remain jailed in Nashville.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
The city of Burlington decided on Thursday to “indefinitely pause” a sanctioned parking area for people experiencing homelessness before the initiative had even begun.
The “Safe Overnight Parking pilot project” at Perkins Pier along the city’s waterfront was slated to begin on Friday, July 4. City officials announced its creation on Tuesday, as a response to a round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program that has primarily impacted families with children and individuals with severe medical needs.

But on Thursday afternoon, city officials decided to halt the project, in response to “substantial community feedback, and out of concern for the safety of program participants based on threatening comments made by members of the public on various online platforms,” according to a city press release.
Joe Magee, deputy chief of staff for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, said city officials received a significant number of concerned messages from “residents, and businesses, and folks who have boats docked” near the Maple Street lot. 
Social media posts expressing hostile sentiments about the project also led city officials to worry about the safety of unhoused people staying there, Magee said. The police department planned to do additional patrols of the area, Magee said, but the parking lot would not have had a “stationary overnight security presence.”
The city had received two inquiries from people who had wanted to park overnight in the lot, which was supposed to have space for twelve vehicles, Magee said. Officials had not yet approved any registrations for it.
Between June 23 and July 1, state officials anticipated 140 adults and 61 children would lose access to the motel voucher program in the Burlington area. The current wave of evictions from the program is in large part the result of an executive order expiring that had protected families with children and people with acute medical needs, like those who are homebound or receiving cancer treatment. 
Burlington officials estimate that hundreds of people are already sleeping outdoors or in vehicles in the city, with tents tucked along the waterfront bike path an increasingly common sight.
“The city does not have the resources or staff to be able to … address the shortage of shelter alone,” Magee said. “We really need state partnership to come up with more tangible solutions.”

Of those, 137,000 face obstacles from more stringent work requirements in the bill, and the other 33,000 are refugees and asylees who would also no longer be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
Washington would also be on the hook for about $88 million in added administrative costs annually, according to estimates the governor’s office sent out Thursday. And unless Washington reduces its already-low payment error rate, it could have to shoulder upward of $100 million a year in new costs the feds previously paid.
States that can’t pick up those added costs could be forced to severely downsize or shut down their SNAP programs entirely. While the federal government funds the benefits, states run the program. The two levels of government share administrative expenses.
“It’s a very real possibility that states will just choose not to participate in SNAP at all,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition.
Democrats decried the legislation for shredding the social safety net while locking in tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The proposed cuts to food stamps would be the biggest since the program’s launch.
The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program nationwide by an estimated $230 billion over 10 years. This is one of the key ways that Republicans offset revenue losses from lower taxes.
“This bill takes food from our most vulnerable Washingtonians to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.
The White House recently said “the mission of the program has failed,” while the GOP overhaul “promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve the truly needy.”
Currently, SNAP requires able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 54 without dependents to work at least 20 hours per week to access food stamps. The megabill the U.S. House passed Thursday would up that to age 64 and add work requirements for parents whose children are at least 14 years old. Previously exempt veterans, former foster youth and people experiencing homelessness would also need to work.
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the country’s largest anti-hunger initiative serves upward of 42 million people.
The 137,000 who could lose benefits unless they meet the new work requirements make up 15% of the state’s SNAP participants. These requirements could take effect this year.
Others on the program would see their benefits reduced by an average of $56 per month, according to the state Department of Social and Health Services that runs Washington’s SNAP program.
The agency estimates the lost economic activity from SNAP will cost grocery stores, farmers markets and other Washington retailers at least $360 million annually.
The legislation Republicans call the “big, beautiful bill” also carries major financial implications for the state. 
The biggest chunk comes from errors in payments states make to recipients. Based on how often they overpay or underpay, states would have to shoulder more of the cost of funding benefits. Those that keep their error rates below 6% can avoid paying anything. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released error rates for each state in fiscal year 2024. Washington’s was 6.06%. The vast majority of that is overpayments. 
The national average is around 11%.
At the eleventh hour, Senate Republicans carved out exemptions for states with the worst error rates to help win the key vote of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Her state has by far the highest error rate, at nearly 25%.
For Washington, this issue could mean more than $100 million in new state expenses. This won’t start until 2028 federal fiscal year, so the state can still improve its error rate.
The megabill also shifts more administrative costs to the states from a 50-50 split to the feds paying just 25%. 
The reconciliation bill’s passage and looming financial threat for states come as Washington raises taxes and cuts costs to fill a huge budget shortfall.
“This massive payment shift to states is happening at the same time that we’re losing state workers, and as the economy slows for everyone,” Lane said. “Every state’s budget is going to be pressed.”
Trump is set to sign the legislation carrying his domestic agenda Friday. Washington’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and Reps. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, and Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, supporting the bill.
Their central and eastern Washington districts have the most households that receive SNAP benefits, as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Newhouse’s office identified the changes to the SNAP program as provisions that the congressman “worked to secure” and said they would save taxpayers money by “rooting out waste, and instituting long-overdue accountability incentives to control costs.” His office also described the state cost-sharing revisions as “modest.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/food-stamps-SNAP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

The Fourth of July and Pioneer Day drone shows will double the size Salt Lakers saw last year, city officials announced this week.

“So 150 is pretty typical for a drone show. And this year, for the first time, we’ll be doing 300 drones, which will allow us the ability to have bigger, better, more intricate, more detailed images up in the sky with the drones,” said Jana Cunningham, communications manager for the Salt Lake City Department of Public Lands.
For Saturday, the day after Independence Day, the city is planning a big event in Jordan Park starting at 8 p.m. with live music and food trucks. The drone show, scheduled to last about 20 minutes, will begin at 10 p.m. 
The Saturday lights display is set to feature iconic monuments from across the country, Cunningham said, “such as the Space Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge and Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, things like that.”
The city’s Pioneer Day drone show will cap off a full day of celebrations on July 24 at Liberty Park. That event is also set to start at 8 p.m., but the drone display is scheduled for 10 p.m.

To celebrate the most Utah-centric holiday, the city is planning a show that reflects the state’s idiosyncratic culture.
“Spectators can enjoy graphics and images such as national parks,” Cunningham said. “We’re going to do soda shops, because nothing screams Utah more than a dirty soda.” 
Cookie wars, city and state flags, and other Utah landmarks are also expected to make appearances in the drones’ choreographies. 
The city has been hosting drone shows since 2023 in line with its sustainability goals, and attendees have embraced the new tradition, Cunningham said. 
She also said it’s a safer alternative to fireworks.
“We have a great risk of fire,” Cunningham said. “(Fireworks) also create quite a bit of pollution in the air and debris in the air. And really, we switched to drones because it guarantees more of a safe and environmentally friendly celebration.”
Private firework discharges are still allowed in the city. But, there are restricted areas to help prevent accidental fires.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
The Missouri state budget that took effect Tuesday includes more than $79 million in federal funds the state anticipated receiving from the frozen programs. The largest portion is $28.9 million dedicated to improving teacher effectiveness, closely followed by $24.9 million for science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education programs and career counseling and mentorship in those fields.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Morgan McGarvey opposed the measure but not for the same reasons.
Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, whose Appalachian district is one of the country’s most dependent on Medicaid, issued a statement claiming the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “strengthens Medicaid and SNAP benefits.”
An independent analysis of the bill’s effects on rural health care found that Kentucky will suffer the biggest hit of any state — a decline of $10 billion in Medicaid payments to rural providers over 10 years as 130,000 rural Kentuckians are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage. The analysis is by KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.
‘They’ll get over it,’ McConnell reportedly assures GOP colleagues about Medicaid cuts

The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close.
The bill also trims future funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in which 575,000 Kentuckians participate, and shifts to states part of the costs.
In his statement, Rogers hinted that the measure headed for Trump’s desk is not the final word. “Ultimately, this is not the end of our reconciliation work, and as a cardinal member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to improve funding options for our rural hospitals and clinics.”
Rogers, of Somerset, also said, “While the House-version of the bill would have been far better for rural healthcare, the Senate added a $50 billion safety net for rural healthcare providers, carving out funding specifically for rural states like Kentucky, and delaying implementation of new provider tax rates to 2028.”

The House version, shepherded out of committee by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green, protected supplemental Medicaid payments that narrow the revenue gap between Medicaid and private insurance by pumping billions of dollars into Kentucky hospitals that treat a large share of low-income patients. The supplemental payments are funded by a tax on health care providers.
The Senate version, which the House largely adopted, would effectively eliminate the supplemental support that Kentucky hospitals say is critical to their viability, Kentucky Hospital Association President and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Lantern. 
In the Senate, where Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote, Rand Paul of Kentucky was one of three Republicans who voted against the bill, objecting to its deficit-raising effects. Sen. Mitch McConnell voted for it.
The legislation makes tax cuts, including no taxes on tips, effective immediately while the cuts to benefits won’t go into effect until after next year’s mid-term elections.
Guthrie hailed passage of the bill, calling it a “a victory for millions of Americans, providing a historic tax cut, securing Medicaid, and ensuring American energy dominance.”
  U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
But his fellow Republican, Massie of Vanceburg, pointed to the bill’s effects on federal deficits and debt and the economy. The bill will add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie posted on X.
Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, of Lexington, who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate next year, issued a statement saying, “This is the latest and greatest chapter of the Trump economic comeback — and the theme is promises made, promises kept.”
Barr echoed a familiar GOP talking point: “We achieved all of these goals while protecting and strengthening Medicaid for Kentuckians who truly need it — not ineligible recipients or illegal immigrants.”
Rogers, likewise, said: “The bill protects the longevity of Medicaid benefits for our most vulnerable population by slashing waste, fraud and abuse of the program. With 4.8 million able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, who choose not to work, the bill enforces a 20-hour weekly work requirement for those individuals who do not have small kids. Without question, we are adding integrity and strength to Medicaid and SNAP assistance for those who need it most in the years ahead.”
Rogers said the bill “reinvests in coal country, by expanding a tax credit that some coal mines will now be eligible for, including Eastern Kentucky.”

Democrat Morgan McGarvey of Louisville slammed the GOP budget bill’s priorities calling it “a slap in the face to Kentucky and all of rural America. It will kick millions of Americans off their health insurance, take food away from Kentucky families, kids, and seniors, and add trillions to the national debt. All so that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos pay even less in taxes. It is cruel and indefensible.
“I don’t want to hear any Republican who voted for this say they care about rural America or our national debt ever again,” McGarvey said.
Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been an outspoken critic of the measure, repeated his warnings that the changes will be “devastating” for Kentucky.
In an interview on MSNBC, Beshear said 200,000 Kentuckians stand to lose health care and states cannot possibly make up for the federal government’s retreat from funding social safety net programs.
“No state has the budget to fix what the federal government, that Donald Trump and the Republicans are about to break. No state can make up for hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicaid payments flowing through our economy. If you just look at the economy at large, health care is one of the fastest growing segments out there. And this is the Republicans just taking a hatchet to it. We’re going to see job losses across America.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2194945302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 19:03:56.653925

 The Senate version cuts nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over 10 years

The Senate version of the budget and tax cut bill is expected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by around $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 11.8 million over the next 10 years, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Erin Riley, outreach and engagement coordinator with the advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said the estimates in health care reductions are “conservative,” and many of the losses of coverage would be due to increased paperwork under new requirements in the bill. 
“In general, we might see people losing their Medicaid coverage because of eligibility, … but it’s a lot of paperwork,” Riley said. “It’s death by 1,000 cuts. So folks that would probably be eligible for traditional Medicaid, they might get caught up in that cycle of not being able to report that they are eligible. There’s just a lot of red tape.” 
Under the bill, able-bodied adults would be required to work or conduct “work-related activities” at least 80 hours a week and prove eligibility and compliance every six months. There would be exceptions for parents of children under the age of 14. 
Idaho is also pursuing its own work requirement through House Bill 345 for those who are insured through Medicaid expansion — a program approved by voters in 2018 to extend Medicaid eligibility to those who earned too much to qualify for traditional coverage but not enough to qualify for the premium tax credit to get health care coverage through the state marketplace. 
The state’s changes to Medicaid will need to be approved by federal authorities before going into effect.
 Sen. Crapo says bill protects Medicaid coverage for those it was intended for 

The broad-reaching bill extends tax cuts approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration, that mostly benefit wealthy people, critics and some experts say. The bill, among many provisions, also enhances funding for the military and immigration enforcement, ends renewable energy programs approved by the Biden administration, and reduces funding for some public assistance programs, such as Medicaid and food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

Crapo, who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that the bill would protect benefits “for whom Medicaid was intended,” including pregnant women, children, seniors and those with disabilities; Crapo didn’t include in his remarks low-income residents, who were eligible after states were able to expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 
He argued that programs that enroll healthy Americans and undocumented residents have been driving up the program’s costs. 
“This rate of expansion is unsustainable and puts the future of the program at risk,” Crapo said on the floor. 
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch’s office said in a press release that one of the achievements of the bill he supported was it preserved “Medicaid for vulnerable Americans by enacting common-sense reforms that prioritize resources for those who need care.”

Rep. Mike Simpson’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the Medicaid portion of the budget bill, but said in an emailed statement the bill “is the America-First policy agenda that Idahoans and Americans nationwide voted for in November.” 
U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher’s office also could not be immediately reached for comment. He said in a press release that he voted Thursday to “deliver what effectively will result in the single largest tax cut in American history for the American People, and to bolster border and military resources to keep our communities safe.”
In a statement, Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea sharply criticized the votes of Idaho’s congressmen.
“Idaho Democrats believe hard work should mean a roof over your head, food on the table, healthcare you can count on, and a fair shot for your kids. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher just voted to rip that away,” she said. “They backed a Republican budget that pushes the American Dream further out of reach for working people, while catering to billionaires with penthouses and private jets.”

The spending bill does not extend the enhanced premium tax credits, which were passed by Congress through the American Rescue Plan Act to reduce health care premiums through the marketplace established in the Affordable Care Act. The enhanced credits are slated to expire this year, and if Congress does not extend them, many people would see their premiums “skyrocket,” Riley said. 
On average, the tax credits have reduced premium payments by $705 a year, according to the health care policy organization KFF. 
Increases could be more significant for some groups. 
An estimate by Idaho Voices for Children shows an Idaho couple in their 60s, making $82,000 a year, would see their annual premiums rise from $6,970 to over $22,222. 
“With that high premium cost, we’re going to see people drop off because they’re just not going to be able to afford coverage,” Riley said.

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though obviously a fictional scenario, the Virginia planter’s will indicates he did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a country while enslaving people, according to historians. Signed six months before his death in 1799, it ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the general does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort-based theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes (music) lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
Founding Mothers’ Day recognizes SC women’s contributions to The Revolution

The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.

Jim Pillen on Thursday announced an interim director for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development: Maureen Larsen, who currently serves as the governor’s general counsel.
Larsen, who earned her law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law, also serves as Pillen’s deputy director of policy research. The policy division serves as the governor’s personal lobbying arm.
She is to transition from her current role July 21, replacing K.C. Belitz, whose resignation was announced suddenly last month after serving two years on the job. Belitz’s final day as DED director is July 18.
Larsen earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Vermont. 
The DED director has been a rather high-profile position, overseeing grants and funding for economic development ventures and attending related ribbon-cuttings for projects across the state.

Larsen’s general counsel and policy research position has been more behind the scenes. She was quoted in a 2023 Flatwater Free Press story about an apparent unprecedented move by the Pillen administration to shield the governor’s communications.
Larsen, in a response to the news outlet’s request for email, said certain communication of the governor was “protected by executive privilege” or “deliberative process privilege,” the FFP reported. 
Several former and current officials and advocates told the FFP they couldn’t recall any other Nebraska governors invoking that privilege to deny access to records.
Pillen’s media statement thanked Belitz for his service. It did not indicate when a permanent DED director might be named.

The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of […],"The Cole County Courthouse in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)A fight over wording for a proposal to reverse the abortion rights amendment Missouri voters added to the state Constitution in November will look very much like a similar fight in 2023.
The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County with two objectives: Keep the proposal designated as Amendment 3 off of the November 2026 ballot or, failing that, completely reword the ballot language crafted by lawmakers. The job of defending the proposal and the way it is written will fall to Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who is the lead defendant.
In 2023, the ACLU of Missouri also challenged ballot language, written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, but with the intent of getting a citizen initiative on the ballot.
“It certainly feels a lot like deja vu to go back into Cole County and argue again over a misleading and inaccurate ballot summary statement from a Missouri politician,” ACLU attorney Tori Schafer said in an interview with The Independent.
One of the main proponents of the legislative measure, Sam Lee of Campaign Life Missouri, said the lawsuit was expected. He said he doesn’t think the measure will be thrown off the ballot and said the ballot language is defensible and should stand.
“You get a dozen lawyers in a room, and they’ll write it 12 different ways,” Lee said. “And as long as it’s fair and impartial, there are a variety of ways of doing it.”
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law banning abortions in almost all instances. That led to an initiative campaign, which resulted in a 52% majority approving a constitutional amendment that made abortion legal up until the point of fetal viability.
But except for a short period, abortions have remained unavailable because the question of which of Missouri’s abortion regulations remain in force is tied up in court. Prior to the total ban, for example, Missouri required a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion, that a woman seeking an abortion be given a lengthy document about fetal development and that all abortions take place in specially licensed ambulatory surgical centers.
The lawsuit over those issues is being heard in Jackson County Circuit Court, where Judge Jerri Zhang could issue a decision at any time on a request for an injunction against the laws.
The proposal passed by lawmakers would repeal the voter-approved initiative in its entirety and replace it with language that would allow the ban to be reinstated. It would carve out limited exceptions, allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest, fetal anomaly or medical emergencies during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
The proposal would also ban gender transition surgeries or medications for people under 18, and require all lawsuits that raise questions about state laws on reproductive health care be filed in Cole County.
The ballot language written by lawmakers, and being challenged in the lawsuit, would state:
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and
Protect children from gender transition?”

In the lawsuit, the ACLU is arguing that the ballot language is unfair and misleading.
The “summary statement uses language which is intentionally argumentative and likely to create prejudice for the measure,” the petition states.
The most glaring omission is that it does not mention what it is replacing, the lawsuit states. 
“Among other things, the summary statement fails to advise voters that it will repeal a measure they just adopted in the last election cycle,” attorneys wrote.
The language should at least inform voters that there will be no protected right to obtain an abortion, Schafer said.
“The courts back in 2023 made sure we had a fair and accurate ballot summary statement and fair ballot language,” she said. “We know that they’ll do the same this year.”
The gender-affirming treatments language and the provision directing venue of reproductive health care cases to Cole County are impermissible, the lawsuit states. They violate the Constitution’s requirement that constitutional amendments address only one subject.
“We know that the reason that Missouri politicians put that piece about Cole County in there is because they don’t like the fact that we’ve been successful on the (legal challenges to restrictive laws) in Jackson County,” Schafer said. “It was a very politically motivated reason that they put that in.”
Lee said he thinks all the subjects relate to reproductive health care and will survive that part of the challenge.
“It’s a weak argument, because even supporters of what passed in November last year link reproductive health care with transgender care,” he said.
The return to court over ballot language on abortion rights is the latest round of a seemingly endless contest. 
Abortion rights supporters will never give up, Schafer said.
“I feel like what we’re asking for is a very simple thing, which is just get politicians out of health care and let people make their own health care decisions,” she said. “And so that is our stance on that.”
If the legislative measure makes it to the ballot and passes, Lee said, he expects a new initiative to reverse it. Lee has been an anti-abortion activist for decades, including many years as an influential lobbyist.
Asked when he expects the debate to end, Lee said:
“Not in my lifetime. I’m not saying that because of me personally. I’m just saying I don’t expect it to be settled anytime soon.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-03 21:41:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America,"Shalina Chatlani, Stateline and Kim Krisberg, Stateline",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/03/medicaid-cuts-mississippi-lousiana/,"""There's nowhere to go"": An inside look at how already struggling communities in Mississippi and Louisiana could be affected by the Medicaid cuts in the new federal tax and spending bill.","Note: This story first published in Stateline, which is part of States Newsroom, the nation’s largest state-focused nonprofit news organization.
LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.
This week, both chambers of Congress approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
Hard to thrive
Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”
The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
‘The tremble factors’
While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”
Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”

“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington said at the city’s airport commision meeting Wednesday.

A loose group of advocates is urging the panel that oversees operations at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to issue a statement describing — and, some said, condemning — how federal immigration agents have repeatedly used Vermont’s largest air hub to transport people detained in the state and possibly facing deportation to other parts of the country.
Speaking at the Burlington Airport Commission’s monthly meeting Wednesday evening, two advocates also presented data they said showed federal immigration agents are flying far more people out of the airport, which is run by the City of Burlington, than is widely known.
Leif Taranta of Burlington and Brian Clifford of Essex said their findings, which they’ve compiled into a public chart online, suggest at least 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through the Burlington airport since the start of January. That includes transfers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
VTDigger has not independently verified Taranta and Clifford’s work, though a representative from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, which is one of the state’s few networks offering pro bono legal aid to non-U.S. citizens, endorsed the advocates’ effort at Wednesday’s meeting.
“The airport, at a minimum, has a responsibility to let the public know what’s happening inside these walls, and on the tarmac,” Julie Macuga of Burlington, another advocate who spoke at the meeting, told the airport commissioners.
The panel did not develop a statement at its meeting, though the body’s chair, Tim George, said in an interview afterward that he and the other commissioners would continue to discuss the request, including what, specifically, his counterparts would be willing to say.
“I think we’ll have some conversations about that and see how we want to proceed,” he said.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Wednesday’s meeting comes as Vermont officials’ interactions with immigration authorities have drawn increased scrutiny following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk. Both students were in the country legally but have been targeted by President Donald Trump’s administration for deportation. Mahdawi is a Vermont resident, while Öztürk’s detention was challenged in federal court in Vermont.
Federal officials have shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the airport, which is in South Burlington, to facilitate deportations, VTDigger has reported. Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, including Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
Öztürk was shuttled from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to an ICE field office in St. Albans before being flown out of the Burlington airport early the following morning to Louisiana. She spent weeks in detention there before a judge in Vermont ordered her release. Meanwhile, agents attempted to fly Mahdawi out of the airport to Louisiana, as well, after he was arrested while attending a U.S. citizenship interview in Colchester, the student’s lawyers have said.
That a public body as minor as the airport commission — which is only advisory by design and consists of residents from Burlington, South Burlington and Winooski — was facing questions about the actions of federal immigration agents is evidence of just how focused public scrutiny of immigration enforcement in the state has become.

One commissioner, Helen Riehle, a former longtime state legislator from South Burlington, called the use of the airport for transporting ICE detainees “abhorrent.” 
Still, it’s not clear there is much — if anything — the commission, or the staff who run the day-to-day operations at the airport, could do to impact how the federal government chooses to use the facility to transport detainees, said Nic Longo, the airport’s director. He said the airport administration generally is not privy to information about immigration operations there.
“We don’t know when these are happening,” he said, referring to when people are transferred through the airport by federal immigration agents. “We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication.”
He added, too, that the airport could risk losing access to federal grants and other funding assurances by impeding or refusing to comply with immigration enforcement — a point U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made publicly earlier this year. (That threat has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge after a coalition of 20 states, including Vermont, sued to challenge its legality.)

There were several instances, Longo noted, in which ICE agents were parking their vehicles in areas where parking wasn’t allowed. The airport pushed back — in some cases, nearly towing the vehicles — and got the agents to park in spaces generally available to the public. The airport’s goal, he said, is to treat the agents as if they are any other law enforcement officials, or members of the public.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about its operations at the airport. 
Taranta, one of the activists, said the group collected data on those operations using U.S. Department of Justice press releases, the PACER system that tracks federal court cases, and a Vermont Department of Corrections website that provides access to a jail tracking system where people can find friends and family members in the state’s prisons. They also verified the data through news articles and direct observations at prisons and the Burlington airport, they said. 
The activists said the data they collected shows as many as 500 immigration detainees have likely been moved through Vermont between Jan. 1 and July 1. About 460 were highly likely to have been transferred through the Burlington airport, the citizen researchers believe, with many of them booked on early morning flights. 
“That’s a shocking number if true,” said Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, in an interview Wednesday. Stokes said he would be inclined to trust it unless proven otherwise, but he doesn’t believe it’s a statistic the federal government is required to track.
Activists shared that they were concerned people are being moved through the state without access to legal representation. 
A major concern expressed by those who spoke at the commission meeting was that people flown out of the airport — who were often unshackled, in plain clothes and accompanied by U.S. Marshals — did not have an opportunity to meet with an attorney before facing deportation proceedings outside of the state. The early hours of transport, which the activists have said their findings repeatedly show, also make it difficult for attorneys to connect with clients, they said.
“It’s become clear to us that the airport plays a large role in the region’s ICE operations and most people don’t know about this, including the airport commissions,” Taranta said in an interview. “I hope they’ll take some actions against it.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The number of Arkansas students participating in one of three summer nutrition programs offered in the state has already eclipsed last year’s count, officials said Thursday at a food distribution event in Sherwood.
The newest program, Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children, or Summer EBT, was created through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and modeled on a similar initiative created during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Each child enrolled in the Summer EBT program receives a debit card loaded with $120 for purchasing fresh meat, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, breads, snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. 
Arkansas, which has one of the nation’s worst rates of food insecurity, opted into the program last year even as many other Republican-led states did not — a trend that has continued in the second year of the program with 13 states choosing not to participate. Oklahoma has opted out of the program for the second straight year, but some tribal nations within the state are participating.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

This year, 325,000 students have been enrolled into Arkansas’ Summer EBT program so far, said Mary Franklin, director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services’ (DHS) Division of County Operations. DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick said the program, which “makes a lot of sense” for Arkansas, served 293,000 students in 2024. 
The department is accepting applications until Aug. 25.
Of the 325,000 current participants, the vast majority were automatically enrolled in the program because they met certain criteria, such as Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment or receiving free or reduced meals at their school. Only 7,000 participants were not automatically enrolled this year, Lesnick said.
“A lot of those children just automatically don’t have to do anything,” Lesnick said, “but if you aren’t in one of those buckets, you have to fill out an application.”
The one exception, he said, is for those at schools that automatically give all students free or reduced lunch. Those students still have to apply to receive the Summer EBT benefit. Lesnick and Franklin both emphasized that people should apply for the program even if they are unsure if they qualify.
“We’re thrilled [the Summer EBT program] is going well,” Lesnick said.
Patty Barker, the campaign director for No Kid Hungry Arkansas, which is part of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said the rollout of the Summer EBT program has gone much smoother in its second year. State officials highlighted how benefits for students who were enrolled in the program last year were loaded onto the cards they were given last summer instead of new ones. 
Barker said an enhanced focus on messaging, making sure parents and students knew about the program, and an earlier start date, have made the summer nutrition program more successful this year. The alliance worked with the state to get the word out, Barker said.
“The federal program was new last summer, and just the process, it didn’t get started until midsummer,” Barker said. “So this year we were ahead of the game and able to start announcing that the program was going to be offered in the spring before kids go home from school; getting schools on board to be able to make all the families aware. So that was a huge bonus.”
The Summer EBT program is administered by DHS with help from the state Department of Education. Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in an interview that his department coordinates with DHS to help it determine which students should be automatically enrolled in the program.
“We work with [DHS] to help find students and families that qualify, work with school districts that are willing to support…the program. We have a Food and Nutrition Division that helps share the word, communicate, collaborate with a lot of people who may not know that they’re eligible for extra support through the summer,” Oliva said.
Oliva, Franklin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders all emphasized the importance of addressing child hunger before assisting with a drive-up meal distribution outside Cato Elementary Thursday morning. Sanders specifically touted what she described as bipartisan efforts to provide free breakfast to every student in Arkansas regardless of their means, which she named as one of her biggest legislative priorities for the 2025 session.
“It’s one of the biggest challenges we have in our state,” Sanders said of the state’s food insecurity issue, “but it’s something that we are not going to ignore and refuse to take on and tackle. I know that we can move Arkansas from being at the bottom of this list by utilizing programs like this.”
The state offers other nutrition programs to feed students during the summer months. The two other initiatives, both offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state education department, are the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The meal distribution that Sanders and other officials participated in were part of the SFSP, which provides meals and snacks to students at approved sites such as schools. 
Franklin said that the programs were not either-or — students could participate in more than one at the same time.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3868-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

John Perkins.","Karah Spencer Perkins Potter died from the kind of pervasive gun violence her family has spent decades working to curb in Jackson.
At her funeral service Wednesday, family members, friends and others talked about the 23-year-old’s spirit, smile and servant’s heart — reminiscent of her grandfather, renowned civil rights and evangelical leader, the Rev. John Perkins, who advocated for development and racial reconciliation in west Jackson.  
While working at a summer camp run by her family’s nonprofit, the John and Vera Mae Perkins Foundation, Potter helped local kids, taking them for a haircut or out to eat. With her friends, she’d dream up ways to build back Jackson’s forgotten communities.
“She was right on the edge of everything opening up, and she was walking forward with flair,” Liz Perkins, Potter’s aunt, said during the service at New Horizon Church International. “She had a way of making people feel safe just by being with her.” 
But her family believes Potter’s desire to help and protect others may have led to her death in the early morning hours of June 22, 2025.
Potter and some friends had just come from a club when they stopped at a gas station on Northside Drive off I-55 at about 4:40 a.m. There, Potter’s friend and the friend’s boyfriend, Phillip Bullock, got into an argument, and Potter intervened.

An off-duty officer who witnessed the incident said he saw Potter and Bullock arguing with guns in their hands, and Potter fired her gun into the air, according to a redacted report from Capitol Police, the responding agency. The officer also saw Bullock shoot Potter, who fell to the ground, the report said.
After firing, Bullock drove away, and the off-duty officer shot at Bullock, according to the report. 
Officers did not find a weapon at the scene, according to the report. Capitol Police called Potter’s family soon after, and Perkins said they told her the gas station’s video showed Potter was tussling with Bullock when he grabbed her hand, pushed it down, pulled out his gun and shot her in the head. 
The officer also told Perkins that they were still looking for the gun Potter supposedly had. “If she shot the gun, where is the gun?” she asked.
But Bullock has not been charged with Potter’s killing. While the Capitol Police incident report listed his initial charge as aggravated assault, Bullock was charged with possession of a gun as a convicted felon, according to Hinds County Court records. A call to Bullock’s court-appointed public defender was not returned.
In 2017, he had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault against his sister-in-law in Holmes County as well as home invasion. The judge gave him seven years in prison.
Potter’s family is outraged.
“He got out Tuesday, the day after she was declared dead,” said Potter’s mother, Joanie. “He should be charged with murder.”
Perkins said Bullock, who lives just two doors down from the family in west Jackson, is now claiming self-defense, but her understanding is that Potter was trying to get her friend away from him. 
“We ain’t saying she was perfect,” Perkins said, “but Karah was a human being who didn’t need to be shot down like a dog.”
Potter’s parents say she was a charismatic young adult who was trying to figure out her future. After moving to Starkville to attend Mississippi State University, Potter decided not to enroll and moved back home to live with her parents while managing a soap store and studying for the real estate exam. 
“That was going to change her trajectory,” her mother said.
Potter had also recently started bartending at Babes, a local club. In the past month or so, Potter’s mother discovered a gun in her daughter’s drawer and questioned her, but Potter insisted she needed the gun for protection and that everyone at the club had one.
Her mother argued against it. “What about a man overpowering you and killing you with your gun?” her mother quoted herself as asking Potter.
At the service Wednesday, clergymen passed out tissues as gatherers watched videos of Potter laughing, blowing out birthday cake candles, playing with puppies and kittens, visiting Washington, D.C., and riding a horse.

When Potter’s father Ron Potter and his wife got the call from the Capitol Police, Ron said they feared that Potter had been in a car accident. The detective said no, Ron said, she was shot in the head. 
“I was faced with a critical question that I’ve wrestled with for years now,” he said. “That question takes on real flesh, and the question is, does the Christian faith have anything meaningful to say to the lived realities of injustice, terminal illness, sickness, death?” 
In search of answers, Ron said he was forced to take a look at what he called “signals of transcendence” that Potter possessed, or the ways in which God revealed himself through Potter, such as her appreciation for beauty, her desire to form relationships with others and her empathy. 
Those qualities were reflected in many of the other testimonies to Potter’s life. Several of her cousins spoke, and they all said she was like a sister to them. 
One cousin, Shelby Perkins, shared 23 memories for each year of Potter’s life: Her dimples, visiting Jamaica, dinner at the Mighty Crab, shucking peas in their grandma’s kitchen, riding home from the reservoir in the back of their uncle’s truck, holding each other tight as they walked up creaky stairs in their family home, and how the kids at the summer camp adored “Miss KK.” 
“I thank God for handpicking us to be cousins,” she said. 
Potter’s older sister Varah shared that the family adopted Potter, who was just 18 days old, because Varah wanted a little sister. Varah, who is seven years older, said the two did not always get along, though they’d grown closer in recent years. 
“We were like oil and water,” Varah said.

Then Varah read a poem inspired by the flowers that Potter loved. 
Potter’s hairstylist said she wanted to tell Potter’s mother that “she was a good soul and you raised her right.” Another friend said that the day Potter died, she had just left the doctor’s office and was planning to tell Potter that she was pregnant. 
“Now she knows, of course she knows, she’s everywhere now,” she said. 
To honor Potter, the Perkins family has set up the Sunshine Scholarship Fund at the Perkins Foundation to aid young people heading to college. Potter’s parents also say they also plan to work to dissuade young people from owning guns. 
Potter grew up in a family dedicated to community service. The Perkins Foundation, founded in 1983, focuses on “transforming lives, equipping leaders and restoring hope in communities.”
Catherine Cook, who went to high school with Potter at Saint Joseph Catholic School in Madison, said Potter wanted to follow in those footsteps, but the world can be a cruel place for people like Potter who have a big heart. 
“Still, she had a dream that life could be better,” she said. “We would drive around Jackson and point at a building and say this is the business that I want to put in this building or this is how I want to build up the community and I just, I would hate to see her dream never come true.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03160124/IMG_4314.jpg,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Utah Republican leaders celebrated the final passage of the “big, beautiful bill” on Thursday, one day before the self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to bring it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.
All members of the Utah congressional delegation voted in favor of the massive tax and spending bill that supports theTrump administration’s priorities. The bill was ultimately only opposed by two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate.
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Shortly after the House vote, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked the delegation for helping the bill get across the finish line in a social media post.
“Today’s passage of the budget bill is a win for Utah families: it delivers meaningful tax relief, invests in energy abundance,” Cox wrote. “And, thanks to bipartisan teamwork, preserves every state’s freedom to craft commonsense AI safeguards.”
The package passed in a tight 218-214 House vote after undergoing changes in the Senate earlier this week. 
The lengthy bill includes spending plans for border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education. 
It has, however, been heavily criticized for slashing Medicaid spending, effectively leaving millions of Americans without health care coverage.
Utah Democrats were dismayed at what they describe as “devastating” consequences for Utahns who rely on Medicaid, while funding “fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.”
“(Utah’s) Medicaid budget totals $5.5 billion through a combination of federal and state funding. Under this bill, nearly $1 billion, or approximately 20% of that funding, will be slashed,” Utah House Democrats said in a statement. “The consequences are undeniable: sick, low-income, and at-risk Utahns will lose access to critical healthcare. Programs will be gutted. The quality and availability of services will decline. And rural hospitals, who cover more than just Medicaid patients, will close.”
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King called the package “a betrayal of working people” because of its health care and food assistance cuts, among other concerns.

“Utah’s entire Congressional delegation voted yes. Every single one of them chose political survival over public service, cowering to pressure from party leaders, special interests, and the president’s threats,” King said in a statement.
However, Utah Republican Rep. Mike Kennedy, who is also a family doctor, defended the Medicaid provisions included in the bill. He said that as a health care provider, he recognizes how essential the program is, but he argued the government needs to “right-size” it.
“If we don’t take a different trajectory, these programs will collapse under the economic failures of prior administrations,” Kennedy said on the House floor. 
Rooting out fraud, waste and abuse would help preserve Medicaid, Kennedy said in a social media post.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill proves we don’t have to choose. We can protect those in need and stop the waste,” he said.
RECA expansion 
Buried at the end of the bill’s many provisions is an expansion to the Radiation Compensation Exposure Act, or RECA, which compensates people sickened by nuclear weapons development and testing.
That was one of the wins Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy celebrated Thursday.
“While no bill is perfect, the One Big, Beautiful Bill reflects the promises made and kept by President Trump and House Republicans,” Maloy said in a statement.
Called downwinders, people who got cancer or other diseases from above-ground nuclear tests were eligible for federal payments — but not everyone in Utah was covered, despite evidence showing nuclear fallout blanketed the state in the 1950s and 1960s.
All of Utah’s downwinders could be compensated under Senate’s ‘big, beautiful bill’

Now, under provisions included in the “big, beautiful bill,” anyone who lived in Utah and got sick from the tests will be eligible for compensation. The news was met with mixed reactions from advocates who generally opposed the “big beautiful bill,” but were happy to see RECA expanded.
“A bright spot in this otherwise terrible reconciliation bill is that it finally allows some of the people harmed by nuclear weapons testing and production to access a federal program from which they were unfairly excluded,” said Dr. Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That truly is a win for thousands of people across the country, including the people harmed by the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico.”
Mary Dickson, a Utah downwinder, said it was “bittersweet.” She’ll now be eligible for coverage, but told Utah News Dispatch she was disappointed that downwinders in Guam, Montana and parts of Nevada and Arizona were left out.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.” 
Environmental concerns
Environmental groups were quick to decry the bill’s passage on Thursday, criticizing the many provisions that phase out tax credits for renewable energy, require increased oil and gas lease sales, and cut royalties that oil producers were required to pay.
“If Republicans cared about clean air and water, wildlife, or a livable planet for current and future generations, this bill would be dead in the water. But their priorities are clear,” said Travis Hammill, Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
He noted that Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee’s proposal to require the sale of millions of acres of public lands was stripped out of the bill earlier this month after it received “widespread, bipartisan backlash.” 
Mike Lee drops national forests from proposed public land sale, makes several other changes

“While we’re glad to see schemes to sell off public lands stripped from the Budget Bill, we are clear-eyed about the impacts of the rest of the bill: gutting tax credits for clean energy, attacking the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and creating new handouts to extractive industries – all of which will devastate wild public lands for decades to come,”  Hammill said.
Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the public land advocacy group the Center for Western Priorities, called the bill a “handout to billionaires at the expense of working people.”
“It gives a multi-billion dollar tax cut to the oil and gas industry, which is already raking in sky-high profits, and adds billions to the federal debt,” Rokala said. ““This bill cuts the public out of public land management, making oil and gas drilling the dominant use of public land and removing avenues for public participation from the leasing process. The vast majority of Westerners want to see public lands managed for clean air and water, as well as wildlife habitat conservation and increased recreation access. This bill does the opposite.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 21:12:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford school board member to challenge Larson,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/john-larson-challenger-ruth-fortune/,"Ruth Fortune, a mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education, will be the first Democrat to challenge Larson’s U.S. House seat.","Ruth Fortune, a 37-year-old mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education who came to the U.S. from Haiti as a young undocumented immigrant, filed papers Wednesday declaring her intention to challenge U.S. Rep. John B. Larson for the Democratic nomination in 2026.
The first tentative steps by towards beginning a race — Fortune created a campaign committee with no public announcement or sign of private outreach to political players — might have gone unnoticed in other years, but Democrats are hypersensitive this cycle about potential intra-party challenges.
An immediate question Thursday from some Democrats, none of whom was willing to be quoted out of deference to Larson: Will the filing break the ice and prompt others to take a look at running against a long-serving incumbent who had a “complex partial seizure” during a speech in February and turns 77 this month?
Three of Connecticut’s five U.S. House members are 72 or older, age was a difficult and ultimately disqualifying issue for the octogenarian Joe Biden in 2024, and the Democratic Party is in the midst of an identity crisis after the loss of the White House to Donald J. Trump. 
Larson, a former state Senate leader first elected to Congress in 1998, is raising money for a run in 2026, when Democrats hope to recapture the closely divided House — a realistic goal that seems to be encouraging every member of the delegation to run at least once more.
In a telephone interview, Fortune offered no criticism of Larson and said her motive for running was not in reaction to anything the incumbent has said or done.
“My reasons for running are my reasons for running. I want to bring my voice, my lived experiences, my fierce advocacy, and really try to do as much as I can to support people as they try to aspire to whatever it is that their dream is and their goals are,” she said. “I thank Congressman Larson for his service.”
Fortune’s challenge to Larson came as a surprise to Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who appointed her to the school board a year ago, and the city’s Democratic chair, Marc DiBella.
“Somebody texted me about it,” Arulampalam said. “I was surprised. It was the first I heard.”
DiBella said by text he did not know Fortune and offered no further comment.
The 1st Congressional District represented by Larson is overwhelmingly Democratic, meaning the only threat to Larson would come in a primary. Larson, who is from East Hartford, has not had a primary since 1998, when the seat was open. He said his plans to run again are unchanged.
“In a democracy, anyone who desires to run is free to do so. I fully intend to announce my candidacy after the municipal elections this year,” Larson said in a texted statement. “I remain proud of the achievements for the 27 towns I represent and work with, especially the people my office has been able to help and serve.”
Fortune has a compelling personal story, but no experience as a candidate for elective office.
Testifying in favor of financial aid for undocumented students before the General Assembly in 2016, when she was a law student in her mid-twenties and about to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, Fortune offered herself as an example of what educational opportunity can mean to a young immigrant.
“My family left Haiti in 2000. We came to the U.S. as tourists and became undocumented immigrants in search of a better future,” Fortune told lawmakers. “When we first arrived, eight of us, including my parents and brother, shared one bedroom in my aunt’s house. But the house had indoor plumbing, running water and even more importantly, access to the U.S. school system.”
They settled in Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island. She said she graduated from Baruch College, which was relatively affordable, and lived in a sublet that cost $350 a month.
Fortune said Thursday that the Obama administration gave Haitians temporary protective status after an earthquake devastated Haiti, multiplying the island’s many miseries.
“I think at that point, to be honest, I realize how much good government can do, how much it is really a force for good, if it is used in that fashion. And shortly after that, I sort of figured, I want to go to law school. I want to understand more how the law works, why it is it can do these things that it does,” she said.
Fortune said she arrived in the U.S. as a tourist with her family. She was 12 and spent her first decade trying to live inconspicuously as she obtained an education.
To lawmakers in 2016, she said, “I made it through college because I was able to pay in-state tuition rate and frankly because I lucked out by getting a good waitressing job during college that allowed me to pay my $4,000 annual in-state tuition out-of-pocket.”
Fortune is a graduate of the University of Connecticut School of Law and an associate at Wiggin & Dana, specializing as a trust and estate lawyer. She is married, the mother of three and lives in the West End of Hartford. In her testimony, she described volunteering for Barack Obama in Iowa in 2012.
“The best training I received as a campaign staffer was on how to effectively tell my story and how to ask for what I want,” she said.
Larson, who has made stabilizing Social Security a personal crusade, said after joining other Democrats in voting against Trump’s bill that extends tax cuts at the expend of social safety net program, his focus remains the same. 
“My focus has been and continues to be protecting and enhancing Social Security,” Larson said. “Right now, we are in a battle with the Trump administration and fighting back against their direct attempts to privatize and cut Social Security as they continue to slash the nations’s number-one nutrition program, SNAP, and kick 17 million people off their health insurance.”
His seizure in February came during a speech in the House, when he froze and lost the ability to speak. A day later, he attributed the episode to a heart valve replacement 15 years ago.
“Sometimes, people with this condition can later develop symptoms such as the momentary change in speech or movement that was apparent yesterday,” Larson said.

A month later, a video of Larson passionately complaining about Elon Musk refusing to answer congressional questions regarding how Social Security factored into the Trump administration’s plans for cutbacks went viral, winning notice and applause from Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
“Where’s Elon Musk?” Larson thundered at a committee meeting. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated, but that does not put him above the law or the responsibility to come before this committee in this Congress. If he’s so great, if these plans and all the fraud and abuse that he found are so imminent, why isn’t he here explaining it? You know why? Because he’s out to privatize Social Security.”
Maddow approved.
“I’m happy to report that Congressman John Larson is definitely back and at full strength,” Maddow said. “He has been eating his proverbial Wheaties. He appears to be very hydrated, very energized, and, may I suggest, you get out of his way.”
Larson had a second, less dramatic episode in April, briefly pausing in mid-sentence at a Hartford press conference.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fortune_Ruth_square-scaled.jpg-1024x1024.avif,,,2025-07-03 18:07:35.127822

(Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
Judge gives administration until Tuesday to put birthright citizenship plans in writing

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Laura Kelly said she and former Topeka physician Ted Daughety, shown together during Kelly's inauguration ceremony in 2023, have been granted a divorce. They were married in 1983 and moved to Topeka in the late 1980s. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said Thursday that she and her husband of more than 40 years were granted a divorce.
She decided to speak publicly about the amicable end of her marriage because of inquiries about the status of her relationship with retired physician Ted Daughety.
Kelly, 75, said the pair remained on friendly terms before and after the divorce was finalized in October. They were married in 1983 and have two adult daughters.
“Throughout my time in public office, I’ve always guarded my family’s privacy. It’s been my policy to keep my personal life separate from my public one to the extent possible,” Kelly said.
She said it had “come to my attention that my marital status has become a topic of some speculation, so I will share that Ted and I divorced in October of 2024.”
“It was amicable and mutual, and we both continue to share in the lives of our family,” the governor said.
The Democratic governor’s brief statement was the first official confirmation of a split. The governor resides at the Topeka residence for Kansas governors known as Cedar Crest. Her family home in the Potwin neighborhood of central Topeka has been sold.
In a statement, Daughety said that “Laura and I made this decision together, based on what worked best for us and for our family.”
Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate to represent a Topeka-area district in 2005 and remained in that job for nearly 15 years. She was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022.
Daughety was a pulmonary and sleep disorder specialist who practiced medicine for decades in Kansas.
Divorce among sitting U.S. governors hasn’t been common, but Democrat John Carlin ended two marriages while serving as governor of Kansas.
Carlin took office in 1979 and received a divorce from Ramona Hawkinson in 1980. Carlin and his second wife, Karen Bigsby Hurley, were divorced in 1985 during his second term.

Michelle Lujan Grisham on July 3, 2025 said she may call a special legislative session to address fallout from the federal Republicans' budget bill. (Eddie Moore / Albuquerque Journal)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday she may need to call a special legislative session to address the impact to the state from the Congressional Republicans’ passage of their so-called “big beautiful bill.” The GOP’s tax and spending legislation includes cuts expected to cause millions of Americans to lose health care access through Medicaid; curtail food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and hurt rural hospitals, among other repercussions.
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

“The Republican budget bill is an abomination that abandons working families and threatens the health and well-being of New Mexicans,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “Their vote to slash funding for health care and child nutrition to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-rich isn’t just bad policy—it’s an outright betrayal.”
The bill, she added, “will hit New Mexico hard. From cuts to Medicaid funding that keeps our rural hospitals open, to reductions in food assistance for children, to threats against education programs that ensure our kids have a brighter future, this budget puts politics over people. It also amounts to an egregious tax hike on Americans who will pay higher prices for health care, electricity, and other services.” The governor noted she is “prepared to call a special session if necessary to protect New Mexicans from their fiscal assault.”
Earlier this week, New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told members of a newly established federal funding stabilization committee that as many as 88,530 New Mexicans will lose their Medicaid coverage due to provisions in the bill. The bill will also likely cause 58,180 New Mexicans to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said.
New Mexico House Democrats issued a statement shortly after federal passage of the bill saying that “out-of-touch” Republicans had passed “the most cruel and backwards bill we have seen in our lifetimes.” Republicans, the statement said, “are kicking folks off their healthcare, shuttering our rural hospitals, letting children and seniors go hungry, and raising costs for all working people, in order to please President Trump and line the pockets of his ultra wealthy donors. This legislation will have a devastating impact on families across our country and right here at home.”
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee also told lawmakers this week that New Mexico interest earning record oil and gas revenues will help buffer the state from some of the cuts, which House Democrats noted in their statement.
All three Democratic New Mexico members of the U.S. House of Representatives held a joint news conference shortly after the vote in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, referring to the tax and spending legislation as a “big, ugly abomination of a bill” and the “biggest rollback in American history, directly attacking our communities.”
Stansbury further cited the effects on New Mexicans’ health care, food security and education, saying the bill “is going to have truly catastrophic impacts for New Mexico.” Republicans, she added, are trying to downplay those impacts.

“And so our question is, then, ‘Why did they have to pass it in the dark of night in both the Senate and the House?’ It’s because they know millions of Americans are going to be hurt by it, but they don’t care. Their message to America today is: They won. America loses. They don’t care. You can lose your health care, you can lose your food assistance, you can lose your education. They don’t care.”
That being said, Stansbury added, “We don’t want New Mexicans to lose hope. We want them to use their understanding of what’s about to happen to fuel the fight. We have to take back the House.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who represents the southern portion of the state in the 2nd Congressional District, described himself as “furious.”
“This is the biggest tax giveaway to the richest people in this country, and it’s being paid for on the backs of working families,” Vasquez said. “And the saddest thing is, is that it’s taking health care away from those who need it the most.”
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández from the 3rd Congressional District, said she refers to the budget reconciliation bill as the “betrayed for billionaires” bill. Leger Fernández further contrasted and described the types of bills passed under federal Democratic leadership, such as the Affordable Health Care Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which helped insure all Americans, invested in renewable energy and stimulated the economy, respectively, she said.
“It shouldn’t be that just the wealthy get the good life,” she said. “We all want the good education, a good home, good health care, a beautiful planet to live on, right? That’s the good life. But Republicans are actually, instead of …waking up thinking about the American dream…we are waking up into the American nightmare because their big, ugly bill undoes all the progress that Democrats were making.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Unknown-1024x707.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

(Photo via Google Earth) An Iowa home-health agency accused of using falsified records and billing for care services that were never documented has engaged in “fraudulent practices,” a state board has concluded.
While the Iowa Board of Nursing recently cleared a Cedar Rapids nurse of any responsibility for some of the alleged issues, it did conclude records had been falsified by someone at Compassion North America, that Medicaid had been double-billed for some services, and that an unlicensed nurse was providing patient care for the company.
Joseph Lemor, the CEO of Compassion North America, said this week that testimony at the hearing was inaccurate and that the board’s conclusions were factually wrong and stemmed from a “witch hunt” by the board. He said the company plans to appeal the board’s decision to district court.
In July 2024, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Lemor’s wife, registered nurse M’balu Kebbie, with improper delegation of nursing services and falsifying records related to the nursing practice or knowingly permitting the use of falsified information in such records.
A hearing on the charges was held in April, and although it was closed to the public, the board’s findings from the testimony and the evidence presented during the hearing were recently made public.
According to the board, Kebbie was first licensed by the board in April 2007. At some point, she began working for Compassion North America, a home-health care agency that is based in Cedar Rapids and run by her husband. Kebbie was the company’s director of nursing and human resources, according to Compassion’s website.
In September 2022, the board alleges, it received a complaint from a patient, “G.F.,” who alleged Compassion had assigned unlicensed staff to perform skilled nursing care tasks, and that the staff failed to complete documentation of the care provided in his home.
G.F., who is a Medicaid beneficiary, had sustained a spinal cord injury in a 2018 car accident that resulted in quadriplegia, and he now uses a wheelchair for ambulation. He also has a tracheostomy — a surgically created opening in the throat to facilitate breathing — and uses a ventilator.
According to the board, G.F. was hospitalized for several days in June 2022 due to a severe infection. He was then discharged to his home, with a physician’s order for temporary, 24-hour, in-home skilled nursing care, seven days per week. The care was to include maintenance of his tracheostomy, wound care, intravenous catheter-line care and medication monitoring.
Compassion North America was approved by Iowa Medicaid’s managed care organization, Amerigroup, to provide the services from June 29, 2022, through Aug. 29, 2022.
In addition to Kebbie, the board alleges, Compassion employees Elizabeth Smith and Maudalyn Pierre provided most of the services — although G.F. later complained the company never provided the 24/7 level of staffing that was ordered and approved, and also claimed the staff behaved unprofessionally.
The board alleges that after becoming concerned with the professional qualifications of the staff, G.F. and his mother informed the state that they had not seen any of the staff take notes or complete any documentation while in their home.
They alleged that after they asked Compassion to provide them with copies of their nursing notes and other records, the company never complied. The board says that after G.F. relayed his concerns about Compassion to Amerigroup, the managed care company “then terminated its contract with Compassion” at the end of August 2022.
Board: Nurse was ‘unlicensed’ at the time
A state investigator allegedly reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees, which reportedly showed the company was not actually providing 24/7 care to G.F. as ordered.  The caregivers listed on the work schedule allegedly included four individuals, only two of whom — Kebbie and licensed practical nurse Elizabeth Smith — were licensed nurses.
However, Smith’s nursing license had expired in January 2021 and was not reactivated until 18 months later, on July 6, 2022.
The state investigator reviewed thousands of pages of records subpoenaed from Compassion, the board says, and concluded Smith was the only nurse to document any nursing care for G.F. from June 29, 2022, through July 1, 2022 – during which time Smith was unlicensed.
In addition, the records regarding G.F.’s care did not always identify who performed the tasks or what specific care was provided. A comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for skilled nursing services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care had ever been provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
Smith reportedly told the investigator Compassion never provided her with a functioning computer, so she completed her documentation in a notebook that was left at G.F.’s home. According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation – including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for services related to G.F.’s care.
Board records show Kebbie denied falsifying or fabricating records related to G.F.’s care, and explained that her husband was the sole person responsible for billing. As for her role as the director of nursing, Kebbie denied knowing Smith’s license had lapsed and denied she was responsible for supervising Smith’s work.
Board rules on ‘fraudulent practices’
With regard to the allegation that Kebbie had improperly delegated to Smith certain tasks that were outside the scope of Smith’s license, the board concluded the documents supporting that claim were most likely fabricated by Compassion after the fact — and so, the board reasoned, there was “insufficient evidence” to support the allegation.
As for the allegation that Kebbie had delegated nursing responsibilities to an individual she knew was not licensed at the time, the board concluded that while Smith was supervised by Kebbie, “there is simply not enough evidence to conclude she knew the LPN’s license was inactive when providing care to the patient.”
However, the board added, the evidence did suggest Kebbie failed to properly delegate G.F.’s care to Smith. As the supervising registered nurse, the board said, Kebbie was responsible for the implementation of care plans, the supervision of Smith and the accuracy of medical notes.
Kebbie, the board said, had admitted she had not reviewed Smith’s documentation of G.F.’s care. As such, the board concluded, Kebbie had violated state regulations related to unethical conduct.
With regard to the allegations of falsified records, the board dismissed that charge as it related to Kebbie while noting there was evidence “someone associated with Compassion” had falsified documents.
Had Kebbie “properly reviewed her subordinate’s records or otherwise given G.F.’s care plan the appropriate amount of attention, she would have known fraudulent practices had occurred,” the board said. “Nevertheless, there is not enough evidence in the record to support the conclusion that (Kebbie) knew the records were falsified.”
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation that will entail some level of supervision by a board-approved monitor.
However, state records show that in 2012 the board disciplined Kebbie for briefly working as a nurse while her license was inactive. In that case, the board agreed to a settlement that called for Kebbie to pay a $50 civil penalty.
CEO: Board is engaged in a ‘witch hunt’
Joseph Lemor, Kebbie’s husband and the CEO of Compassion North America, said the board’s written findings are replete with factual errors, adding that the board’s ruling will likely be appealed to district court. No sanctions have been imposed on Compassion North America by the nursing board, whose jurisdiction is limited to the employees engaged in nursing.
With regard to Smith’s lack of an active nursing license, he said that at some point in time — he said he was unsure as to when — he checked with the board and determined Smith was properly licensed. But, he said, it was Smith’s responsibility to make sure she was licensed at the time she was delivering care to Compassion North America’s patients.
“It’s the personal responsibility of the nurse to make sure they’re not working without a license,” he said. “She has to defend that herself.”
As for the board’s assertion that Amerigroup terminated its contract with Compassion North America, Lemor said, “That is false. Nothing like that happened.” He said the company is still an approved care provider that is reimbursed by Medicaid for the services it delivers to Iowans.
Lemor said the nursing board is engaged in a “witch hunt,” adding that he questions whether the patient, G.F., actually filed a complaint with the board due to what he sees as irregularities with the patient’s alleged signature on documents.
The board’s assertion that his wife admitted having failed to review Smith’s documentation, along with the board’s finding that records were falsified, are also untrue, he said.
“We did not do anything improper,” he said. “We have nothing to hide.”
He said he is currently disputing the amount of money Compassion North America collected for G.F.’s care, saying the company was “extremely underpaid.”

Speaking publicly for the first time, Allison Layton Statham called for Duncan to go free in a July 22 bail hearing. “This innocent man is on death row,” she told Mississippi Today. “Justice needs to be done.”
In April, a judge threw out Duncan’s conviction, questioning their conclusions and citing the failures of his court-appointed counsel.
Prosecutors have appealed the judge’s decision and are fighting his release on bail, saying Duncan poses both a flight risk and “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.”
Statham disagreed and said she wants all of the evidence, including a sealed video of a bite-mark expert examining her child’s body, made available so that everyone can know the truth. “Authorities are still wanting to bury the truth,” she said. “What they did was railroad him.”

For a long time, Haley’s paternal aunt, Jennifer Berry, awaited word of Duncan’s execution, she said. “We’ve mourned quite a few people in our family, and we have never mourned like we mourned when that child died.”

Since talking with a documentary filmmaker in February and digging into the case, she believes he should go free. “I’ve been in turmoil since realizing this,” she said. “He’s a young man who was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
She has petitioned prosecutors, the attorney general and the governor for a meeting but has yet to receive a reply.
The judge’s dismissal marks at least 10 wrongful convictions involving pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, who has since died, or bite-mark expert Michael West, who once claimed he matched a suspect’s teeth to a half-eaten bologna sandwich. Eight of these wrongful convictions happened in Mississippi.
In 1994, the American Board of Forensic Odontology suspended West for a year for overstating credentials and misidentifying bite marks, and a dozen years later, he was forced to resign from the American Board of Forensic Pathology.
In 2008, the state of Mississippi barred Hayne from doing autopsies. He once wrote in his autopsy report about removing and examining a victim’s ovaries. The problem? The victim was male.
That same year, Levon Brooks and Kennedy Brewer were exonerated after spending a combined 30 years in prison. West’s bite-mark testimony helped convict Brooks of the rape-murder of a 3-year-old girl in Noxubee County. When another 3-year-old girl was raped and killed, West gave bite-mark testimony that helped lead to a death sentence for Brewer.
DNA discovered the truth: a serial killer had raped and murdered both girls. He confessed to his crimes, and Brooks and Brewer were freed.
It remains unknown how many other wrongful convictions these experts may have played a role in. Hayne once said he conducted up to 30,000 autopsies in Mississippi. West has said he analyzed more than 300 bite marks and investigated more than 5,000 deaths. He no longer believes bite marks should be used in court and did not respond to requests for comment on the dismissal of Duncan’s conviction.
Berry felt compelled to come forward now and call for a review of each case in Louisiana and Mississippi involving these discredited experts, she said. “Every case they put their fingers on needs to be reopened and examined.”
‘I wasn’t going to lie for them’
On the morning of Dec. 18, 1993, Statham said as she left for work Oliveaux was bouncing on her bed, tossing her “moo cow” in the air. She said she left her daughter in the care of the 25-year-old Duncan, whom she loved and had been living with for several months.
Duncan, who has maintained his innocence for more than three decades, told police he made Oliveaux oatmeal for breakfast and put her in the bathtub, where the water measured less than 3.5 inches. While doing dishes, he said he heard a noise and found her face down in the water. He said he grabbed her out of the tub and ran next door. The neighbors, paramedics and doctors were unable to save the life of Oliveaux, who had suffered recent seizures.

Haley Oliveaux
When Statham said she arrived at the emergency room, Duncan was distraught, apologizing over and over. Police charged Duncan with negligent homicide.
At the hospital, when West Monroe Police Detective Chris Sasser examined the body and saw the girl’s anus dilated and “laying open,” he concluded she “had been sodomized,” according to the police report. “It was a horrible sight.”
Rather than use a nearby pathologist, then-District Attorney Jerry Jones had the girl’s body transported two hours away to Mississippi for Hayne to do the autopsy. After the pathologist examined Oliveaux, he called in West to examine suspected bite marks.
Video captures West’s initial examination, starting at 9:35 p.m. He mentions a bruise on her left elbow, possible abrasions and contusions, and visible diaper rash. No mark can be seen on her cheek, and West makes no mention of one.
Twenty minutes later, Hayne telephoned Detective Sasser and said at about the time of the child’s death, she suffered lacerations and penetration to the anus, which the pathologist attributed to sexual assault, as well as multiple contusions to multiple surfaces on the body and lacerations and contusions to the scalp, according to the police report.
Hayne also said there were adult bite marks on the child made at or about the time of death and asked for the suspect’s dental molds.
After receiving this information, Sasser contacted a prosecutor, and the charge was upgraded to first-degree murder, which can carry a death penalty in Louisiana.

After the molds arrived the next day, the video resumed. West can be seen jamming a mold of Duncan’s teeth into the child’s cheek. West identified these as bite marks belonging to the suspect.
Hayne did the autopsy. He concluded that Haley’s death was a homicide, that her injuries suggested she had been sexually assaulted at or about the time of her death and that she had been forcibly drowned.
Other pathologists questioned Hayne’s conclusions. A rape kit came back negative. The Louisiana State Crime Lab tested Duncan’s clothing, the child’s clothing and her bath toys for any seminal fluid. There was none.
In the days following her daughter’s death, Statham said prosecutors called her into their office. She said they asked her if her daughter ever said or implied that Duncan wanted her to suck his penis like a baby bottle.
She told Mississippi Today that her toddler daughter could hardly speak. “She could say, ‘I want burgers,’ or ‘I want M&Ms,’” she said.
After she told them no, she said they replied, “If you don’t tell the truth, you could be implicated.”
She was 21 at the time. “My baby died, and the man I loved had been hauled off,” she said. “It was very intimidating. I was scared. But I wasn’t going to lie for them.”
Months later, police got a statement from jail inmate Michael Cruse. He quoted Duncan as saying the baby pointed at his penis and he said “something about a bottle or bobble.” Cruse later testified that Duncan said he blacked out and when he came to, he was trying to have sex with the baby and killed her because he “couldn’t get the baby to be quiet.”
To demonstrate his innocence, Duncan took a polygraph test. He reportedly showed no deception when he said he didn’t kill the child or hold her head underwater. Jurors never heard this, because polygraphs are inadmissible as evidence.
By the time the trial began in 1998, much of the important physical evidence was gone. The rape kit had been lost. So had Hayne’s autopsy slides. Samples of her blood that no one had tested for toxicology — a standard practice for autopsies — had been destroyed. So had Hayne’s detailed reports on his slides.
All that experts had available to examine were Hayne’s autopsy report and a few photos of the child’s body and injuries.
In his opening remarks at the 1998 murder trial, the district attorney said Duncan “rode that baby like a bull” and “in a sexual frenzy … bit her behind the ear … bit her elbow … She screamed, and she died in a bathtub full of water so bloody you couldn’t see the bottom.”
With West’s credentials now under question, prosecutors relied on another expert, who looked at West’s photos and identified Duncan as the one who made bite marks on the child. That expert didn’t see West’s video. Neither did the defense experts. Neither did the jury.

Hayne backed up the prosecution theory that Duncan drowned the child to cover up his sexual assault. He told jurors the bruise on her head was “consistent with a digit, such as a thumb or finger, pressing down on the back of the head.”
Asked if the child could have suffered a seizure, Hayne said no because “the brain showed no sign of seizure activity.”
Hayne testified that the child wouldn’t have survived her anal injuries, and another doctor told jurors there would have been so much blood, it would be like someone having their head cut off.
But police never found a drop of blood anywhere in the house, never found any evidence of cleaning. The detective later said if there had been any blood or semen at the scene, they would have discovered it.
Hayne testified that fragmented tomato, pickle and onion were in the child’s stomach, but no oatmeal — a detail prosecutors seized on as proof that Duncan concocted this cover story to conceal his horrific crime.
When police arrived, they found oatmeal in the kitchen, in the bathtub and on Duncan’s clothing. The neighbor saw uncooked oatmeal when he cleared Oliveaux’s throat before performing CPR.
The prosecutors told jurors the uncooked oatmeal was proof he planted it.
The jury convicted Duncan and sentenced him to death.
‘Bad medicine, bad science and bad lawyering’
Tucker Carrington, who wrote a book on Hayne and West with journalist Radley Balko, “The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist,” said the Louisiana case bears similarities to the case of Jeffrey Havard, convicted of capital murder for allegedly raping and killing an infant in Natchez in 2002, thanks to Hayne’s testimony.
Havard has said he was bathing his girlfriend’s 6-month-old baby, Chloe Britt, when she slipped from his hands and hit her head on the toilet.
But as in Duncan’s case, law enforcement officers thought the baby had been sexually assaulted. At trial, a parade of doctors and nurses testified about anal rips and tears they saw, describing the worst anal trauma they had seen, and prosecutors called Havard a monster.
The autopsy report, however, showed no such damage, only anal dilation and a small contusion. The rape kit came back negative.
Despite that, Hayne’s testimony backed the prosecution’s theory of sexual assault, and Havard was sentenced to Mississippi’s death row.
After examining the case, renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden concluded that Britt’s injuries were consistent with her being accidentally dropped and that she wasn’t sexually assaulted. “Dilation of the anus occurs normally in children when they die as muscles relax and when seen by a casual observer can be misinterpreted as evidence of perimortem penetration,” he said.
Other pathologists agreed with Baden that the anal dilation had been misread as abuse, and in 2014, Hayne told a reporter he didn’t believe a rape took place. He said the anal contusion could have resulted from a bowel movement.
He originally testified that the baby had died from shaken baby syndrome. Now he said he didn’t believe that was true because science had since determined such conclusions were flawed.
At least 34 people have been exonerated in shaken baby cases after being wrongly imprisoned, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Graham Carner of Jackson, Jeffrey Havard’s current attorney, said his client’s case is filled with “bad medicine, bad science and, frankly, bad lawyering.”

After a three-day hearing where the defense called Hayne to testify, the trial judge reduced Havard’s sentence from death to life. His appeal for freedom is now pending in U.S. District Court.

Havard’s lawyer, Graham Carner of Jackson, said the case is filled with “bad medicine, bad science and, frankly, bad lawyering.”
After a three-day hearing where the defense called Hayne to testify, the trial judge reduced Havard’s sentence from death to life. His appeal for freedom is now pending in U.S. District Court.
“Innocence is different than not guilty, and innocence is different than you didn’t get a fair trial,” Carner said, “but I believed as soon as I dug into Jeffrey’s case that he was an innocent man and I believe that to this day.”
‘Science, like law, evolves over time’
The damage that Hayne and West have done to Mississippi is immense, said former state Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr., and he is stunned the state has never reviewed their cases for possible wrongful convictions.
“They operated in Mississippi for years unchecked,” he said. “Mississippi used Hayne as the state medical examiner, even though he did not meet the statutory qualifications.”
Hayne’s testimony helped convict Tyler Edmonds, who was just 13 when he falsely confessed that he and his half-sister had both killed her husband. He said she had told him she would “fry,” but he would go unpunished.
At trial, Hayne testified that the fatal wound was consistent with two people pulling the trigger, saying, “I can’t exclude one [shooter], but I think that would be less likely.”
The Mississippi Court of Appeals concluded such testimony was scientifically unfounded: “You cannot look at a bullet wound and tell whether it was made by a bullet fired by one person pulling the trigger or by two persons pulling the trigger simultaneously.”

Diaz said Hayne’s testimony prompted him to dig deeper. “Two hands on a trigger? You don’t have to do any research to know that’s ridiculous,” he said. “That’s what led me to look at Hayne closer.”
What he found was disturbing. He didn’t realize Hayne was essentially acting as state medical examiner, but he wasn’t a board-certified pathologist.
Diaz wound up writing a scathing dissent centered on the pathologist that prompted other justices to change their minds, he said. “As science, like the law, evolves over time, one generation’s expert is another’s quack.”
He now regrets the first vote he cast on the high court, a death penalty case that relied on the words of Hayne and West, he said. “Based upon their testimony, my first Supreme Court vote was to execute an innocent man, Kennedy Brewer.”
He and other justices later supported the dismissal of Brewer’s conviction, and his last opinion called for the end of the death penalty. “It’s not a workable system when errors like this can take place,” he said. “No matter how careful we are, we’re going to vote to execute innocent people.”
What the jury never heard
In November 1993, Statham brought her daughter twice to the hospital for seizures after she stopped breathing. One doctor suggested she could be suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, often to medication, that can cause lesions in the mouth and the genital area. The disease can also cause seizures.
Nearly three weeks before her death, a chest of drawers fell on Haley, who suffered three skull fractures and a subdural hematoma that caused her to spend six days in the hospital. Duncan and Statham told child social services that she had been climbing to reach her piggy bank.
But the jury never heard about this serious injury because of a deal that Duncan’s original lawyers made with prosecutors.
Pathologists say it’s critical to know everything possible about a person’s medical history before drawing conclusions about a death. Testimony shows police knew Oliveaux’s medical history, but it remains unclear if Hayne knew that history before concluding she had been raped and killed.
In a six-day hearing last September, two pathologists called Hayne’s conclusions unfounded, said they saw no evidence of a rape or homicide, and believed Haley drowned accidentally, perhaps after suffering a seizure.
In one sworn statement, former jail inmate Michael Lucas said he heard Duncan tell Cruse that he didn’t kill the toddler. An investigator testified that Cruse now admits he lied at the 1998 trial because he wanted leniency for the felony he was facing.
Duncan’s lawyers told those at the hearing that they planned to show West’s video involving Haley, warning that it was graphic and disturbing. An excerpt of that video had first surfaced in 2009 when the Reason website published it. The video appalled many in the legal and forensic science communities.
The video showed West jamming, dragging and scraping Duncan’s dental mold across the child’s body dozens of times. Some of those in the courtroom gasped, some covered their eyes, and others, including Duncan, wiped away tears.
After seeing the video, Lowell Levine, past president of the American Board of Forensic Odontology, called what West did “fraud.”
In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences concluded there was no basis in science for forensic odontologists to conclude a person is “the biter” to the exclusion of all other suspects. 
Adam Freeman, past president of the American Board of Forensic Odontology, testified that the bite marks identified on Haley weren’t bite marks at all. He called these determinations “junk science” that can’t be defended scientifically.
In 2015, he helped conduct a study on the reliability of bite marks. In all but a few cases, board-certified dentists couldn’t even agree if they were looking at a bite mark. As a result, he resigned from leadership in protest and stopped doing any bite-mark analysis.
Nationwide, at least 34 wrongful convictions have occurred since 1989 because of bite marks, six of them in Mississippi that all involve West, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Dr. Robert Bux, who served as chief medical examiner for the El Paso County Coroner’s Office in Colorado Springs, questioned how Hayne could say the child’s injuries matched shoving her face underwater.
If that were so, “I’d expect to see injuries on the front part of her body, particularly on her forehead or nose, cheeks, anterior parts of shoulders, anterior parts of the knees,” said Bux, who helped investigate Pat Tillman’s death in Afghanistan.
The autopsy showed lacerations to the anus. Bux said these could have been caused by an infection, a diaper rash, a hard stool or vigorous washing. “There’s no way to know. You have to look at it microscopically, and it wasn’t looked at,” he said.
Up until 2007 or so, people believed anal dilation proved sexual abuse, he said. “A dilated anus means nothing. We saw it all the time in adults and children.”
The lack of blood at the scene suggests something other than a violent assault, he said. “It’s absolutely bloodless. I mean where is the blood in the sink? Where’s the blood on the victim?”
He rejected the claim by Hayne that the child stopped bleeding because she was dead. Blood gives way to gravity, he said. “It’ll come out drip, drip, drip, so, you’re going to see it, and you’re going to see it for hours, and you’re going to see it for days. I don’t think you can just wash that off because it’s going to continue to ooze after she’s dead.”
Her death appears to be “a tragic accident of drowning,” he said. “I don’t see any evidence to me that would support that it was forced.”
She drowned, possibly because she suffered another seizure, he said, “but I can’t prove that because Hayne didn’t do any investigation that would help us on that.”
Hayne’s lack of research and examination prompted Duncan’s lawyers to twice ask for the exhumation of Oliveaux’s body before the 1998 trial. The judge denied the requests.
Her mother said if her daughter’s body needs to be exhumed to answer any questions, she supports that. “It might give us some answers to what happened then,” Statham said.
If prosecutors win their appeal, Duncan would remain on death row and face execution. ProPublica and Verite News reported that Duncan’s bid for freedom has become more urgent with Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry pushing for executions. In March, Louisiana held its first execution in 15 years, using nitrogen oxide to put Jessie Hoffman Jr. to death.
If Duncan faced another trial, jurors would hear a much different story, his lawyers said. “Rather than the State’s sensational story of pure horror — including rape, biting, blackouts, a panicked forcible drowning, and a cover-up involving massive quantities of blood that Mr. Duncan, cold and calculating, cleaned up before seeking help for the child — the jury would instead hear the true story: Haley tragically but accidentally drowned in the bathtub.”
After the 1998 trial, Statham spiraled downward. She could have survived her daughter’s death, but surviving this horror story proved nearly impossible, she said.
Duncan’s conviction didn’t just destroy his life, she said. “All of our families were destroyed by this. We’re still collateral damage in this.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday mustered a mostly party-line 218-214 vote to approve President Donald Trump’s signature federal tax and spending bill, which will head to his desk for a signature on Friday, July 4.
The bill’s passage marked a major victory for U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) after weeks of dissension and some initial defections. The bill includes a wide swath of tax and spending cuts that some have warned would kick millions off Medicaid and force states to take up the bulk of costs on key social programs.
While Democrats in Michigan castigated the bill’s passage as doing real harm to the most vulnerable, GOP members of Congress cheered the action, saying it delivers on Trump’s various campaign promises.
Each member of Michigan’s Republican congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill, including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, who has previously declared his intention to seek the Michigan GOP nomination for governor in 2026.
“We’re cutting taxes on tips and overtime, protecting Social Security, rebuilding American manufacturing, and putting an end to handouts for illegal immigrants and able-bodied adults who won’t work,” James wrote in a statement shared on X. “This bill secures our border, strengthens our economy, and keeps our word to the American people.”
U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), the House Republican Caucus chairwoman, told ABC News that “people in my district” wanted Medicaid dollars only going to the most vulnerable, and not undocumented immigrants or others that Republicans have deemed ineligible to receive those funds with new work requirements.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We know that Medicaid isn’t exactly on solid ground, so we really need to make sure that when we put a dollar into that Medicaid program, that it is going to the most vulnerable,” McClain said. “That’s what Republicans have done. They have shored up Medicaid, making sure that the most vulnerable get those benefits that they deserve, and that they get them for the future to come.”
She called Democratic Party efforts to stall, upend or warn people about the consequences of the bill “fear mongering” and equated it to gaslighting the American people.
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), who is a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, posted on X that he was attending the enrollment session for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” with Johnson, noting that it would be sent to Trump to sign on Friday.
Huizenga called the process “a long, but very important journey for the future of America.”
U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) said in a statement released by the U.S. House Education & Workforce Committee, of which Walberg chairs, that Congress took decisive action to bring cost downs for Americans – a claim that will be watched closely by critics of the bill.
“This bill puts forward the first set of significant conservative reforms to the higher education landscape in two decades,” Walberg said. “And thanks to the Committee and House Republicans’ initiative and hard work, the One Big Beautiful Bill will help maintain America’s world-class higher education system.”
U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in a statement said he believed the bill would “prevent the largest tax hike in American history, lower energy costs, and permanently secure our border – all while protecting the integrity of Medicaid and SNAP for those who need them most.” 
“This legislation will create thousands of good-paying jobs to boost our economy, ensure the middle class keeps more money in their pockets, and invest in a brighter future for America,” Barrett said. “It also delivers on promises made to hardworking families and businesses in Michigan: no tax on tips or overtime, permanent tax relief, an expanded Child Tax Credit, and more.”
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) called the budget bill “one more huge win for Michigan thanks to President Trump.”
“Under this plan, working families will get to keep more of their paychecks,” Hall said in a statement. “Our border will be far more secure and criminal illegal aliens will be removed from our communities. The American military will be even stronger. And taxpayers will finally see better value for their dollars as wasteful programs and fraud are cut out of the budget. This is exactly what Americans voted for, and this is what Michigan needs to be successful.”
Democrats decry bill’s passage as a ‘fail’ for Michigan
Meanwhile, Michigan Democrats sharply criticized the bill, calling out its impacts on vital programs like Medicaid and food assistance while noting the plan largely benefits the richest in our country.
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) reiterated her “no” vote in a statement, saying the bill would make life more expensive for Michigan residents, who are already facing high costs.
“Working families will lose their health care, children will go hungry, and our seniors will lose access to long-term care, all to pay for massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. Everybody will see daily costs go up like health care, utility bills, and food to help Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos make more money,” McDonald Rivet said. 
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) called the bill “an act of violence against our communities,” marking the largest cut to Medicaid in history. 
“Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for saying the people losing their health care will just ‘get over it’ because ‘we’re all going to die.’ They are responsible for the over 50,000 people who will die unnecessarily every year because of this deadly budget,” Tlaib said. 
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) highlighted how the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would harm his constituents, calling it a betrayal of the working class.
“My district has the fourth highest SNAP participation rate in the country at 29%, and 47% of our district relies on Medicaid to get the healthcare they need to survive. My decision to vote no on this bill was the easiest I’ve had as an elected official, as these cuts will deeply harm every single person in my congressional district,” Thanedar said. 
In addition to raising concerns on the bill’s impacts on healthcare and food assistance, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) noted the package would eliminate investments into manufacturing and place rural hospitals at risk of closure as a result of its cuts to medicaid. 
“This bill will benefit the millionaires and billionaires like Donald Trump at the expense of Michiganders. I will continue to stand up to this Administration every single day, until we finally see a deal that works for Michigan and the people I care so deeply about,” Stevens pledged. 
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), similarly committed to working for her constituents, after citing the 218-214 margin on which the bill passed as evidence that it will have disastrous consequences. 
“Our work is not over. Today is a disappointing day for our nation, but we will continue to work towards the future that West Michigan deserves,” Scholten said in a social media post. 
Also in a social media post, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) called the bill one of the most consequential, devastating, dangerous bills Congress had passed in recent history, questioning why anyone would vote in support of the policy. 
“This bill is a complete and total failure. The American people overwhelmingly disagree with it, and will not forget those who chose to vote for this cruelty,” she said. 
Curtis Hertel Jr., chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, slammed Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation for their support of the bill, honing his criticism on members sitting in vulnerable Congressional districts. 
 “Congressmen James, Barrett, and Huizenga are betraying the very Michiganders they promised to serve when they chose Donald Trump’s reckless agenda over parents with cancer and hungry children,” Hertel said, noting “Michiganders will not forget what they’ve done when November comes.”
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee similarly honed its criticism on Barrett and Huizenga, with Chair Suzan DelBene calling their support for the bill “the latest and loudest declaration of the fact that they will always prioritize serving Republicans’ billionaire campaign donors at the expense of the children, families, and workers they’re supposed to represent.”
“The DCCC will make sure every battleground voter knows how vulnerable House Republicans — including Barrett and Huizenga — abandoned them by passing the most unpopular piece of legislation in modern American history, and we’re going to take back the House majority because of it,” DelBene said. 
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lambasted James, Barrett and Huizenga, while applauding her Democratic colleagues for opposing the bill. 
“I stand with them and remain committed to doing everything in my power to defend Michiganders. It’s time to stop playing politics with people’s lives and get to work on real, commonsense solutions that improve people’s lives.” 
With James running as one of the Republican hopefuls in Michigan’s 2026 gubernatorial election, the Democratic Governors Association laid into the representative as a key vote on the tax and spending bill. 

The DGA similarly criticized former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard for his support of the plan, while calling on Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) and Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox – other high profile Republicans seeking the governorship – to “be clear about whether they, like their competitors, support taking away Michiganders’ health care all to pay for big tax cuts for the wealthy.”
Groups continue to ring alarms over Medicaid cuts
Various political advocacy groups also sounded off in statements released Thursday, mostly calling out the bill and those who voted for it.
“We will not forget when you put the pocketbooks of billionaires and your own greedy political ambitions above the health of your people,” said Monique Stanton, CEO of the Michigan League of Public Policy. “And when health clinics and hospitals close and the stories of loss begin to spread, these same lawmakers will try to place blame on the states. When Michiganders lose their lifesaving coverage over unnecessary additional bureaucratic hurdles, these same lawmakers will claim they are preventing fraud, waste and abuse, of which there is no evidence.”
The result of cutting Medicaid funds could be devastating to Michigan’s health care infrastructure, costing Michigan hospitals more than $6 billion over the next decade as facilities attempt to maintain the same level of care, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association, in a statement.
About 70% of Medicaid, for which 1 in 4 Michiganders is a recipient, is federally funded while the state funds the other 30%. As states navigate how to continue health care coverage for millions of residents, Michigan hospitals may have to eliminate service lines or close down entire facilities, Peters said.
“This bill is an attack on Medicaid, expanded health insurance coverage and healthcare access. We are extremely disappointed with the actions taken by Congress. Today is an extremely large step backwards for making and keeping our communities healthier,” Peters said.
The bill’s one-year ban on state Medicaid funds for certain health care nonprofits that provide abortions could force Planned Parenthood to shut down nearly 200 health centers across the country, eliminating another sector of Michigan’s public health care system Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan said in a statement earlier this week.
The bill aims to effectively shutdown Planned Parenthood health clinics and impose an abortion ban even in states like Michigan where abortion rights are law, Phenicie said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mikejohnsonjulyshutt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

Big changes could be coming to the fairgrounds, which state officials hope to develop to benefit the nearby International District and address the state's housing shortage. (Photo courtesy NM State Fair)A board the New Mexico Legislature created earlier this year took its first steps Thursday toward what could be a $500 million investment in a long-struggling neighborhood in the heart of Albuquerque, a process that could also result in the relocation of the New Mexico State Fair. 
At the New Mexico State Fair Tax District Board’s first meeting, members committed to statewide standards around open meetings and procurement; announced the hiring of a design firm tasked with creating a master plan for the fairgrounds; and outlined how the New Mexico State Fair Commission will employ eminent domain to buy out business owners in one corner of the fairgrounds. 
Members include New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), along with other state, county and city leaders. 
The board is empowered to raise property taxes and issue up to $500 million in bonds to fund the development. The bonds are backed primarily by future gaming revenue taxes generated at the Downs casino and racino, which holds a multi-decade lease on property within the fairgrounds perimeter. 
Based on expected taxes and current interest rates, the board could quickly raise up to $170 million in bonds to finance the project, according to a report from the Legislative Finance Committee.
Lawmakers early this year passed Senate Bill 481, which established the new special tax district and board membership. The board also announced Thursday that Stantec, an international design firm, had won a competitive bid awarding it $850,000 to come up with a master plan for the fairgrounds. 
Stantec also developed the master plan for Netflix’s Mesa del Sol campus south of Albuquerque, along with mixed-use developments in Denver and El Paso. 
Lujan Grisham, Stewart and others have touted the potential dramatic change at the fairgrounds as a way to rescue the adjacent International District, which has long been plagued with high poverty and crime rates. The governor deployed National Guard Some neighborhood advocates have raised concerns about who will benefit from the investment and whether it will gentrify a working-class neighborhood.

While no decisions have been made about whether the re-envisioning of the Expo New Mexico property will mean the relocation of the fairgrounds, Lujan Grisham said Thursday that Stantec will be giving serious consideration to that possibility as it completes options for the master plan. 
The fair has been held at Expo New Mexico since 1938. 
Redeveloping the area could also allow the state to build more housing units in a state and city with a severe housing shortage, advocates have said. “This state land in the heart of New Mexico’s largest city presents a unique opportunity to create badly needed new housing for the workforce, while spurring massive private investment,” Lujan Grisham said in a December news release touting the plan. 
Martin Chavez, the former Albuquerque mayor, is spearheading the project as the governor’s senior adviser. He told Source New Mexico after the meeting that while the project has never been intended as an affordable housing development, that new mixed-income housing is a key component of the new master plan Stantec is working on. 
That said, there is no minimum number of housing units that the firm is required to develop a plan around, he said. 
The board has much else to iron out for the development to occur, including Expo New Mexico’s forced acquisition of a handful of businesses, including restaurants and a tire shop, on the southwest corner of the property near Central Avenue and San Pedro Avenue. 
Ricky Serna, the state Transportation Department secretary, said his agency will support Expo New Mexico as it handles the eminent domain process and outlined next steps at the Thursday meeting. 
State officials said they will soon approach business owners in the area with offers to buy their properties, offers that contemplate the value of the businesses, costs to relocate and the property themselves. 
Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa raised concerns about whether the business owners would be fairly compensated and whether buying them out would just result in more vacant buildings in a neighborhood with a lot of them. She pointed out that the nearby Wal-mart and two national pharmacy chains across the street have left.
Lujan Grisham responded the state would own the buildings and would manage them as productively as possible during the “parallel planning” regarding the redevelopment that is occurring at the same time the state is acquiring the buildings. 
Keller, attending the meeting remotely, said he’s seen repeated state efforts to redevelop the fairgrounds and invest in the International District that have dissipated without action. The passage of Senate Bill 481 and the meeting Thursday were already more action than he’s seen in years, he said. 
“This is real, and that’s good,” he said. “So I just want to appreciate a little bit of bias towards action, so that’s what we need, and I’m confident that we’ll do it in a fair and appropriate way.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2849216211_b3194b76c6_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

Florida is moving to solidify its renaming of the training airport where the 3,000-person capacity detention center in the Everglades is located to “Alligator Alcatraz.”
Workers covered the sign at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport Wednesday night with a replacement bearing the moniker Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier publicly rolled out two weeks ago, when he announced plans for the facility, according to a photo published in the Miami Herald. Uthemeier announced Wednesday that hundreds of immigrants were set to arrive that night.
“It’s definitely our official title,” said Bryan Griffin, the governor’s communications director, to reporters on Wednesday morning. But immigrant and environmental advocates and indigenous leaders have criticized the name.
During President Donald Trump’s visit to the detention center on Tuesday, Uthmeier told the president he’d been inspired by his quest to reopen California’s Alcatraz Island, which served as a maximum-security prison from 1934 to 1963 and is now a public historical landmark.
Trump applauded the name when he visited the detention center on Tuesday, and the press release announcing the presidential tour had “Alligator Alcatraz” in the dateline.
“It’s known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is very appropriate because I looked outside, and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon,” Trump said. “But very soon, this facility will house some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.”
Feds tell court they’re not in charge of Everglades detention center after migrants arrive

While the identities of those who arrived at the detention center Wednesday night is not yet known, approximately 71% of immigrants detained nationwide have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
The rebranding of the airport prompted the Republican Party of Florida to sell shirts, beverage coolers, hats, and mugs, and the official U.S. Department of Homeland Security and White House X accounts have posted AI-generated images of alligators wearing “ICE” hats.
Both the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida have denounced the opening of the detention center. William “Popeye” Osceola, secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe, said he considered the portrayal of alligators and pythons as guards to the detention center as contradictory to the environmental harms.
“It’s just, again, not an accurate framing of the actual issues out there, and, you know, adding more stress to this ecology that’s not gonna help anything when we still need a lot more resources to address what’s going on out there,” he said. “People aren’t gonna be aware of that because they’re gonna be focused on this idea of like, ‘Oh Alligator Alcatraz, what a fun name.'”
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, called the merch ugly and criticized the media’s adoption of the DeSantis administration-given name.
“It’s like a cartoonish name that’s supposed to sort of normalize the center, diminish it’s negative impact in the minds of the public while also associating immigrants with crime through the name Alcatraz — which in Americana and history is associated with one of the most nefarious prisons in American history,” Kennedy said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“So, I do think the name is regrettable, and so many people just kind of regurgitate it.”
Responding to a suit filed in federal court to halt the detention center, the federal government tried to distance itself and referred to the site as the temporary detention center or TNT Detention Facility.
Elise Bennett an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups suing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, said her group opposes the harm to the environment in the Big Cypress National Preserve.
“The name itself really shows that this is a political stunt,” she told the Phoenix.

(Getty Images)A New Jersey appellate panel dismissed a personal injury suit Thursday against homeowners in Morristown, reaffirming that residential property owners are not liable for sidewalk injuries unless they actively worsen hazardous conditions.
The case was brought in February 2021, after plaintiff, Debra Gottsleben, went on a morning walk and slipped on ice outside of a home owned by Christopher and Maureen Annese.
The couple purchased the home in October 2020 but left it vacant during renovations that lasted until August 2021, according to the ruling.
Gottsleben slipped on their sidewalk one snowy morning in February 2021 and immediately sought medical attention for multiple fractures in her left ankle, which required surgery, the ruling states. 
Gottsleben argued that the Anneses’ should be held liable, saying the home should be treated as a commercial property because it was under renovation. She also argued that the Anneses worsened the sidewalk’s icy condition by negligently clearing the snow or failing to do so. 
The lawsuit also sought damages for her injuries.
New Jersey follows a bright-line rule for sidewalk liability, which says that commercial property owners are liable for failing to maintain sidewalks. Residential property owners are generally not liable for this, unless they worsen the natural condition and create a hazard, as Gottsleben argued.
The Anneses countered that they did not worsen the condition of the sidewalk. The day of the fall, over three inches of snow fell, according to Gottsleben’s own weather expert. 
Gottsleben’s husband had taken pictures of the scene, but not until after snow had covered the sidewalk.
A panel of three judges unanimously ruled that the Anneses cannot be held liable for the injury, rejecting Gottsleben’s claims.
“It is not our role to create new exceptions to the sidewalk liability principles that have been repeatedly enunciated and modified by the Supreme Court,” Judge Jack Sabatino wrote.
The judges agreed that the home was always intended for personal use, not commercial use, and did not bear the same liability as a commercial property. Photos of the sidewalk did not represent conditions at the time of her fall, because most of the snowfall occurred after her fall, they said.
“If a jury were permitted to impose liability in these circumstances based on contradictory evidence and speculation, the policy consequences for homeowners could be detrimental,” Sabatino wrote.
The decision maintains the current precedent, that residential property owners in New Jersey are not liable for failing to remove snow or ice from sidewalks unless their actions exacerbate sidewalk dangers. 
The court also acknowledged that expanding liability to unoccupied homes under renovation might improve safety for pedestrians but would require further legislative action.

However, that law does not protect people convicted of serious crimes.","In summary
The Trump administration faults California’s sanctuary state law for allowing what it describes as violent criminals to remain in the country. However, that law does not protect people convicted of serious crimes.


After launching immigration sweeps that sparked weeks of protests in Los Angeles, the Trump administration faulted California policies for protecting those they described as “the worst of the worst,” meaning immigrants convicted of violent crimes.
“Why do Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass care more about violent murderers and sex offenders than they do about protecting their own citizens?” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a news release announcing a group of LA detentions.
However, records and a CalMatters analysis show the state had previously coordinated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempting to hand over two of the agency’s top targets in LA:  Roland E. Veneracion-Enriquez and Cuong Chanh Phan, both of whom had served time in state prisons for violent offenses.
That cooperation undercuts the Trump administration’s characterization of why it launched a massive immigration crackdown in the nation’s second-largest city. 
Chanh Phan, who had served time after being convicted of murder, was released directly to ICE in 2022, records show. 
As for Veneracion, state prison officials in May told ICE about the prisoner’s upcoming release, but the feds did not pick him up. Instead, the convicted sex offender was released, and ICE trumpeted his arrest in Los Angeles two weeks later.
California’s so-called sanctuary law does not apply to unauthorized immigrants convicted of serious crimes, and state prisons have handed over more than 9,000 people with those backgrounds to ICE since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, state data show. The same rules apply to county jails, where sheriffs sometimes complain that ICE fails to pick up people who they believe should be deported in compliance with the sanctuary law.
In those cases, prison or jail employees communicate with federal immigration authorities before someone’s release.
Four others on the “worst of the worst” list had served time in Los Angeles and Orange County jails, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Officials at those jails said they did not know whether sheriff’s deputies had been in communication with ICE about those men prior to their release.
Top Trump officials have repeatedly said they’re targeting “criminal illegal aliens,” but immigrant and civil rights groups allege federal authorities have launched an indiscriminate enforcement blitz that’s mostly netted day laborers and workers from Latino communities who are not threats to public safety.
Between June 6 and June 22, immigration enforcement teams arrested 1,618 immigrants for deportation in Los Angeles and surrounding regions of Southern California, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to CalMatters last week. During that time, masked agents have arrested car wash employees, farmworkers, U.S. citizens, and people attending their immigration court hearings. 
Federal data obtained by the Cato Institute shows 65% of the people booked into ICE detention since October 2024 have no criminal convictions. More than 93% of those booked were never convicted of violent offenses, according to the libertarian research center. Data shows immigrants — including those who are undocumented — commit crimes at much lower rates than U.S.-born citizens do.
Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to emailed questions from CalMatters about the arrests of Veneracion and Chanh Phan. 
How ICE detainers work
An ICE detainer – or an “immigration hold” – is a written request between a jail or prison and federal immigration authorities to coordinate the prisoner’s release directly to immigration authorities, typically to start the process for deportation. 
ICE holds or detainers are the primary method immigration authorities use to find people for deportation. Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national nonprofit that provides legal training and does pro-immigrant policy work in California and Texas, estimated in January that 70 to 75% of ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. were historically handoffs from another law enforcement agency, such as local jails or state or federal prisons. 
When a person enters the state prison system, the corrections department is required to identify people who may be subject to deportation within 90 days and send an initial inquiry to ICE. Typically, ICE will respond about whether the person can be deported and, if so, issue a detainer. The detainer means ICE will take custody of the person upon their release. 
Shortly before an individual is released, state prison employees again contact ICE and let them know the person’s release date is approaching. ICE then decides whether or not they will pick the person up. 
So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 587 people of 11,231 inmates released from the state prison system. They pick up about 87% of the people whom they’ve placed detainers on, state data shows.  
What we know about former prisoners detained in LA
Veneracion-Enriquez, 55, was released from a California state prison in May after spending 28 years in prison for rape, according to the California Department of Justice’s sex offender database and the corrections department. The corrections department was ready to hand him over to ICE, but a day before his release, ICE cancelled his detainer, state officials confirmed in response to questions from CalMatters. 
That month, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation contacted ICE about Veneracion’s pending release, as required by law. Emails show that they notified ICE that Veneracion was going to be released within 15 days. Typically, the federal immigration agency prefers to apprehend criminals in a controlled location directly outside a state prison.  But on May 19, ICE cancelled the hold, according to state officials. He was released a day later.
Veneracion was released and given an ankle monitor to wear that broadcast his location to law enforcement authorities. His address was included in the sex offender registry. According to state records, his last registered address was at an apartment complex in Long Beach. 
Immigration authorities then arrested Veneracion, a citizen of the Philippines, on June 7 during his regularly scheduled ICE check-in at the Los Angeles ICE office. It’s unclear if he’s been deported.  
Chanh Phan, the other former state prisoner highlighted on the Homeland Security Department’s “worst of the worst” list, was released directly into ICE’s custody in August 2022 during the Biden administration, according to corrections department records.  He was on parole until Aug. 14, 2024. 
“Criminal Illegal Alien Arrested during Los Angeles ICE Operation Committed Notorious Gang-Affiliated Murder of Two Teenagers at a Graduation Party” is the headline on the press release the Department of Homeland Security sent out to publicize its arrest of Chanh Phan, a 49-year-old from Vietnam. He had spent 24 years in prison for second-degree murder.
“This criminal illegal alien is who Governor Newsom, Mayor Bass, and the rioters in Los Angeles are trying to protect over U.S. citizens,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the press release. 
It is unclear what happened after California released him to ICE, such as whether Chanh Phan remained in ICE detention or whether he was released by ICE into Los Angeles and then re-arrested last month. CalMatters does not have details about where or how Chanh Phan was arrested by ICE earlier this month.

Newsom vetoed bills to expand sanctuary law
California adopted its sanctuary law during the first Trump administration. It’s meant to shield unauthorized immigrants accused of minor infractions from facing deportation. 
The law allows state corrections officials to continue working with federal immigration agencies regarding individuals in state custody who are facing deportation after serving their sentences. It also allows local law enforcement officials to work with the feds for individuals convicted of serious or violent felonies, such as assaults, child abuse, felony DUI, and other crimes.
At the local level, at least one sheriff wishes ICE would pick up more people. 
In March, the Orange County sheriff made headlines for complaining that ICE wasn’t picking up all of the people it could. Sheriff Don Barnes told the Orange County Board of Supervisors that out of 48,000 suspects booked into jail in 2024, 733 were deportable, but the state’s sanctuary law prevented deputies from alerting ICE about 456 inmates. Of the remaining 277, 49 were not picked up by federal authorities, Barnes told the board.  
“Those who are not picked up by ICE continue to victimize our community and consume law enforcement resources,” he told the county board. 
State lawmakers have tried expanding the sanctuary protections to people in prison. In 2019 and 2023, Newsom vetoed two bills that would have restricted the corrections department’s cooperation with ICE.
In the most recent veto, he said that the current law  “strikes the right balance.”
Newsom has long positioned California as a bastion of immigrant rights, often clashing publicly with federal officials over deportation policy. But under his watch, the state has facilitated thousands of transfers from prison to ICE – a point he recently emphasized in a back-and-forth on social media with Trump Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. 
“Yes, we seek sanctuary from your stupidity,” Newsom’s press office recently posted, responding to criticism from a former Trump aide in April. “P.S. Voldermort, you should know the state has coordinated 10,588+ times with ICE to remove dangerous criminals from the state since Governor Newsom took office.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 17:07:53.537385

(U.S. House of Representatives screenshot)West Virginia House of Representative members Carol Miller and Riley Moore, both Republicans, praised the House’s passage of a massive tax credit and spending bill Thursday.
The House signed off on the Senate’s changes to the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill Act” with a 218 to 214 vote Thursday afternoon, in time for President Donald Trump to sign the legislation by his Independence Day deadline.
Miller spoke in support of the legislation from the House floor. 
“This is a big win for our West Virginia businesses,” she said. “It provides relief to gig workers by ending the Democrats’ absurd $600 1099K reporting threshold and reverts back to the time-tested standard of $20,000 and 200 transactions. It will provide economic relief, secure our borders, and ensure American energy dominance,” she said. 
“This legislation will make the life of the average American better, and I support getting it to President Trump’s desk. I urge all my colleagues to do the same,” Miller said.
  West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore
In a statement, Moore said the bill fulfills a mandate the American people gave Trump to secure the nation’s borders, lower costs, and return to commonsense. 
“This bill provides the largest border security investment in America’s history — $175 billion to finish the wall, hire thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents, and conduct mass deportations — giving the president every tool he needs to restore our national sovereignty,” Moore said. “We also provide the largest tax cut in American history — no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and 88% of seniors will pay no taxes on Social Security.  
The legislation will extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by slashing Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. It will shift some of the costs of a federal food assistance program to the states for the first time. 
In West Virginia, where about 500,000 people get their health care from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, about 82,000 people are expected to lose coverage as a result of changes in the bill, according to a news release from West Virginians for Affordable Health Care.
Nationally, about one million people will lose their health care, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill will increase health insurance premiums for about 67,000 West Virginians by eliminating tax credits for plans through the Affordable Care Act that made them affordable. 
In a statement, Ellen Allen, executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Care, said the state’s congressional delegation betrayed it by supporting the bill. 
“West Virginia’s congressional delegation now has the disgraceful distinction of voting for and helping pass the largest cuts to Medicaid in history,” she said. “In addition to historic coverage losses, ten West Virginia hospitals and three nursing homes could be forced to shut down, resulting in layoffs and hurting local economies. 
“West Virginia’s congressional had the power to vote this devastating bill down and protect working West Virginians and their health care, but instead, they chose to line the pockets of billionaires with even more tax breaks,” Allen said. 
Allen said besides the health care tax credits that expire at the end of the year, the “true pain” of the bill likely will not be felt right away. 
“The worst of this legislation will be felt in 2027 when people lose Medicaid, when hospitals aren’t reimbursed, when people are having trouble verifying work requirements even though they’re working,” Allen said. “So that will snowball into hospitals.”
The bill sets up a $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals, but won’t not enough to cover the people coming to the hospitals with no health insurance, she said. 
“I just can’t see how anybody thought this was a good idea,” Allen said. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party also condemned the bill’s passage. 
“This budget is Robin Hood in reverse,” Democrat Party Chair Del. Mike Pushkin said in a statement. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies are robbing the poor to enrich the wealthy. Over half a million West Virginians — including kids, veterans, seniors, and people with disabilities — just got told they don’t matter.”

State schedules vaccination clinics as measles cases rise to four

People who are not immune to measles should contact their health care provider to discuss protective options, the Health Department said, including vaccination or immune globulin, depending on eligibility and timing. People considered immune to measles include those who:

Were born before 1957.
Received one dose of measles vaccine (MMR) as an adult or from 12 months to pre-school age.
Received two doses of measles vaccine (MMR) as a school-aged child or as an adult at higher risk of infection.
Have a presence of measles antibodies shown by a lab test.
Had a previous measles infection shown by a lab test.

The public alert comes as the in-state number of reported measles cases has remained at four for two weeks. The super-contagious disease is nearing a six-year record as outbreaks spread across the United States. According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update Tuesday, there are 1,267 confirmed cases affecting 34 states.
In response to cases appearing in South Dakota, the state Health Department is holding vaccination clinics across the state through July 10. 
Measles symptoms appear in two stages, first with a runny nose, cough and slight fever. Second, occurring on the third to seventh day of the illness, a red blotchy rash appears and lasts for up to a week. The rash usually begins on the face. The person’s temperature also rises to 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit.

Article Summary

The U.S. House gave final passage Thursday to a bill that will cut federal Medicaid spending in Illinois by an estimated 20%, or $48 billion, over 10 years.
Medicaid pays for about 40% of all childbirths in Illinois as well as 69% of all nursing home care, according to an independent analysis.
State officials estimate 330,000 Illinoisans could lose Medicaid coverage if President Donald Trump signs the bill into law.
The Illinois Department of Public Health said nine rural hospitals in Illinois would face closure or severe service reductions due to the cuts.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — The U.S. House gave final passage Thursday to a budget bill that will cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years.

All three Republican members of the Illinois congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill, despite a last-minute plea from Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker who warned the bill will result more than 330,000 Illinoisans losing Medicaid coverage and have a devastating effect on some rural hospitals.

“As those who are entrusted with protecting the health of all your constituents, I urge you to oppose these harmful Medicaid provisions and work to protect healthcare access for rural Illinois families, workers, and veterans,” Pritzker wrote in the letter addressed to GOP Reps. Mike Bost, Darin LaHood and Mary Miller.

The cuts would translate to about $48 billion in Illinois over that period, or about 20% of what the state would otherwise receive, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.

That would be one of the largest percentage reductions in any state in the nation, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. Louisiana and Virginia would each see cuts of about 21%, KFF said.

The state-level analysis is based largely on Congressional Budget Office estimates showing the bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion nationwide over the next decade.

The KFF analysis does not include estimates of the number of people who would lose Medicaid coverage under the bill, noting how that will depend on how individual states respond to the policy changes contained in the bill. But overall, it estimates the number of uninsured Americans will grow by 11.8 million.

The bill, which includes many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities – including tax cuts and increased spending on border security – passed the Senate on Tuesday by a vote of 51-50, with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Both senators from Illinois, Democrats Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, voted no.

The final vote in the House was 218-214.

“The One Big, Beautiful Bill is a once-in-a-generation victory for the American people,” Miller said in a statement after the House vote. “It delivers on President Trump’s America First agenda with bold, decisive, and immediate action. This is the most pro-worker, pro-family, pro-America legislation I have voted for during my time in Congress, and I was proud to help get it across the finish line for the hardworking Americans across my district.”

Medicaid and the health care marketplace

Medicaid, which is jointly funded by states and the federal government, provides health coverage for lower-income individuals and families. It was established in 1965 alongside Medicare, the federally funded health coverage program for people over 65.

Today, according to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the program covers about 3.4 million people in Illinois, or a fourth of the state’s population. At a total cost of $33.7 billion a year, it is one of the largest single categories of expenditures in the state’s budget. It pays for about 40% of all childbirths in the state, according to KFF, as well as 69% of all nursing home care.

But questions about its future loomed over the Illinois General Assembly during the just-completed legislative session as both Congress and the General Assembly were crafting their respective budgets for their upcoming fiscal years.

“This was a difficult year because of the unprecedented changes and cuts that are looming on the horizon in Washington,” state Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, said on the floor of the Illinois House during debate over a Medicaid bill on the final day of the session.

Speaking with reporters at an unrelated event Tuesday, Pritzker predicted “hundreds of thousands” of people in Illinois will lose Medicaid coverage if the Senate bill is signed into law.

“This is shameful, if you ask me, and it’s going to be very hard to recover,” Pritzker said. “The state of Illinois can’t cover the cost – no state in the country can cover the cost of reinstating that health insurance that is today paid for mostly by the federal government, partly by state government.”

Policy changes under the bill

According to KFF, most of the reductions in Medicaid spending would result from just a few policy changes contained in the bill

Those include imposing a work requirement on adults enrolled in Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.” That law expanded eligibility for Medicaid to working-age adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. About 772,000 people in Illinois are enrolled under that program.

The bill also calls for requiring people enrolled through the ACA expansion to verify their continued eligibility for Medicaid twice a year instead of annually. That is expected to filter out enrollees whose incomes rise above the eligibility limit as well as those who simply fail to complete the verification process.

Another provision would limit the ability of states to finance their share of the cost of Medicaid by levying taxes on health care providers. Illinois imposes such taxes on hospitals, nursing facilities and managed care organizations that administer the program. Revenue from those taxes is used to draw down federal matching funds that are then used to fund higher reimbursement rates to health care providers.

The final version of the bill does not, however, include a provision penalizing states like Illinois that also provide state-funded health care to noncitizens who do not have lawful status to be in the United States. That provision, which was included in the earlier House version, was not included in the Senate bill, according to KFF.

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates released last week, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
In South Carolina, where the entire population is growing, residents 65 and older represented 19.7% of the population, while children 18 and younger represented 21% in July 2024. That compares to 18% and 22%, respectively, four years earlier, according to the estimates.
States such as SC with more affordable housing dominated post-pandemic jobs boom

The national trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.
The median age of South Carolinians in 2024 was 40.5, according to census estimates.

McGeehan told the radio show on Wednesday that he found the individual who actually left the comment — a friend of Masters’ late brother — and he was “very sick,” “basically homeless” and living with substance use disorder after a recent extended hospital stay where he woke up from an almost two-month-long coma. Masters, McGeehan said, had given the man an old iPhone in 2024 that had his personal Instagram account, as well as other social media, still logged in.
On Thursday, Masters further explained the incident and asserted again that he did not leave the comment. 
“I can unequivocally tell you I did not author that comment,” Masters said.
Masters has denied making the comment since it was first reported by West Virginia Watch on June 24. In an interview that day, he said he did not have “any active Instagram account” and did not acknowledge an affiliation with the account’s handle, @NoQuarterMasters. When the comment was made, the account still used Masters’ full name and was previously tagged and featured in photos of Masters posted by other public Instagram pages.
He said Thursday that he didn’t take ownership of the account during his interview with West Virginia Watch because he “wasn’t about to hand over any personal information” to a reporter he didn’t know. Masters did not respond to a phone call for this story.
Masters’ explanation of how the comment was left by someone else through his account largely echoed what McGeehan shared. The person who left the comment, Masters said, was someone he had “known for a long while and cared about and was trying to help.”
“[I] provided them with an older phone [and] some money to try to get back on their feet … It was an older phone my kids had messed around with, but it was ostensibly supposed to be to fill out job applications or reach family or whatever,” Masters said. “I provided that to this person, and I do care about the person — even in light of this — it’s somebody that had been around me during the loss of my brother, somebody who had been very close to my brother and an individual I was trying to help.”
McGeehan said that the person responsible was “probably going to eventually die in the near future” due to either his illness or from overdose. Masters said he learned through McGeehan’s interview that the person “was in an even worse place than [he] was aware.”
“I hope this individual is not that sick, I didn’t know that,” Masters said.
Because this was someone he cared for, Masters said he didn’t at this time want to release their name, but he was “contemplating” doing so.
Masters said he’s working to get information from Meta, which owns Instagram, about the login locations for the account so he can show definitively that it wasn’t him, but he hasn’t gotten that yet.
He also said he’s “been in discussion” with law enforcement regarding the incident.
“I don’t know at present if this circumstance of me leaving a device logged in and a person using that meets that criminal side of things,” said Masters, who is a lawyer by trade. “There’s a lot that I’m trying to process and understand here.”
The profile picture on Masters’ Instagram account — which he said he’s regained control of and has logged out of it on devices he no longer owns — shows a letter addressed to him and partially covered by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. The letter, Masters said, was from his brother, who died by suicide in 2014 and the picture is of a “memorial wall” in his home honoring him.
Several of the runes on the pendants show symbols classified by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping antisemitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols commonly used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals.
Masters said, however, that the symbols have been taken out of context and were meant only to honor his brother, who loved Vikings and read a lot of Norse mythology. 
“It’s a sad aspect of our discourse — in the way that everything has been twisted — that this is somehow this Nazi imagery,” Masters said.
One of the pendants shows a carving of a wolf under a horizontal Wolfsangel. Masters said this pendant was an homage to one of his brother’s favorite songs, “Keep The Wolves Away.” 
The Wolfsangel symbol was appropriated by Nazi Germany as the divisional insignia for several Waffen-SS units and, more modernly, is used in the logo for the Aryan Nations in the U.S. and Europe. Unlike the other symbols, per the ADL, it’s not one that is still associated with other religions or cultures outside of these beliefs.
Last week, the state Democratic Party called for a “legitimate” investigation into not just the comment left by Masters’ account, but into the imagery used in the profile picture.
The party, led by Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, outlined several steps that House leadership should take to clear Masters of charges, including performing a “full forensic investigation” of his devices, social media accounts and email and seeking an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it, among other things.
McGeehan has classified the request from state Democrats as being politically motivated. He called out Pushkin and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish people in the state Legislature — by name, saying they were “not interested in the truth” about who really left the antisemitic comment and were making “deceptive accusations because they desire power and social status.”
The investigation, McGeehan told WRNR, is “over.”
“I’ve done due diligence … It’s over,” McGeehan said. “As far as I’m concerned, this is a witch hunt. That’s it.”

Janet Mills gives State of the State address at the Maine State House in Augusta on Jan. 30, 2024. (Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)After the U.S. House of Representatives finally overcame conservative pushback and passed the massive budget reconciliation package on Thursday, Maine leaders and organizations condemned the spending bill they say will harm Maine people for years to come. 
Gov. Janet Mills decried its passage, calling it an “ugly, purely partisan bill.”
“There is certainly nothing pretty about denying food to hungry children, preventing Maine people from seeing their doctor, or preventing a doctor from being paid,” she said in a statement after the vote. 
Mills said Maine can’t absorb the costs the bill will foist onto the state after slashing federal funding for food assistance and health coverage, among other programs. Her administration will review the final language of the bill in the coming weeks to determine the full impact to the state’s budget. 
The bill’s significant cuts to Medicaid are just one of the areas where the state will be forced to cover costs or risk residents losing access.
An analysis of the package by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid in Maine by at least $3 billion over the next ten years.
With a final vote of 218-214, both of Maine’s two Democratic U.S. representatives, Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, joined their caucus in voting against the measure. With U.S. Sen. Susan Collins as the lone Republican to oppose the bill in the final Senate vote, Maine’s entire delegation ended up rejecting the budget that makes significant reductions to the social safety net to pay for an extension of the tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term as well as $170 billion in immigration enforcement and border-related measures. The bill will also add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
In a statement after the vote, Pingree called the bill “the most harmful, heartless and regressive bill” she has seen in her time in Congress. 
“The impact of this legislation here in Maine will be devastating,” she continued, adding that tens of thousands could lose access to health care and food assistance. 
“It’s an assault on the working class, a gift to the ultra-wealthy, a climate disaster, and a ticking time bomb for the economy.”
Golden said in a statement Thursday afternoon that it could close rural hospitals and “blow up the national debt.”
“This year, we had a real opportunity to pass a budget that put the middle class first,” Golden said. “Instead, from the very beginning, this GOP majority has used a broken, partisan process where the only choices put on the floor seemed to be ‘bad’ or ‘worse.’” 
Collins also cited the threat to rural hospitals as her primary reason for opposing the bill. In a statement after the Senate vote, she said her decision “stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.” 
The left-leaning Maine Center for Economic Policy said congressional Republicans passed “a shell game into federal law—and working-class Americans are the marks.”
“Any child can tell you that $4 trillion is not the same thing as zero, and yet that’s the math Republicans have used to justify their reckless, debt-exploding plan,” said President and CEO Garrett Martin in a statement. 
The bill also includes a provision barring Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion health services provided by Planned Parenthood, which the organization has described as a “backdoor abortion ban.” Maine’s reproductive health providers have warned for months that passage of the bill would dramatically impact their ability to stay open, particularly in rural areas, and continue providing essential care.
“Our patients’ lives matter and the politicians who voted in support of taking away health care to give billionaires tax cuts will have to answer to them,” said Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)Nearly six years after Sioux Falls officials filed a federal lawsuit against chemical manufacturers for pollution discovered in the city’s groundwater, the city received its first installment of settlement money this June: $37.2 million.
Dave Pfeifle, city attorney, said in an emailed statement that the funds will be reserved to “replenish, protect, and secure source water” for the city. Vanessa Gomez, the mayor’s chief of staff, added that the city is in the process of determining the “best course of action” to place the settlement funds into a “restricted and committed” fund to achieve that goal.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, including in modern products such as nonstick cookware and water-resistant clothing, and don’t break down easily in the environment or in the human body. Research indicates PFAS exposure may be linked to negative developmental and reproductive effects, and an increased risk of some cancers.
“PFAS have become a widespread, environmental issue that affects not only Sioux Falls, but the nation, and impacts people’s lives through the everyday products they use,” Pfeifle said. “The City’s proactive response and pursuit of litigation is a testament to our commitment and responsibility to supply safe and reliable drinking water to our community.”
South Dakota government, university plan to start in-state ‘forever chemical’ testing labs

Sioux Falls was one of thousands of plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against manufacturers of firefighting foam that contained PFAS. The settlement agreement was approved by a U.S. District Court in South Carolina last year. The full amount that the city will receive is unknown, Pfeifle said. The city did not respond to a follow up question seeking an explanation.
Sioux Falls alleged that chemical-makers tested for and were aware of health risks of compounds used in a firefighting foam that for decades was tested and stored at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. Investigators for the Air National Guard — which is co-located at the airport — tested the soil and groundwater near the airport beginning in 2013, finding high amounts of PFAS.
Health advisories from the EPA set a safety limit of 70 parts-per-trillion for drinking water at the time. Groundwater and soil near the airport was contaminated at a rate of 255,100 parts-per-trillion, according to analysis of military records by Northeastern University and advocates with the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.
PFAS mitigation, testing and planning efforts
Sioux Falls officials shuttered 21 of the city’s 64 wells “out of an abundance of caution” once the contamination was identified, Pfeifle said, “which significantly impacted the city’s ability to harvest water and severely limited its water supply.”
The Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulating PFAS levels in drinking water at a stricter 4 parts per trillion in 2023, which experts projected would cost South Dakota water systems hundreds of millions of dollars to test and treat. Water providers throughout South Dakota have since been testing drinking water to ensure compliance once the limits are in place, including federal testing of private wells. Initial tests of Mount Rushmore’s drinking water exceeded the new limit in 2024.
The EPA under the Trump administration is planning to delay enforcement of some PFAS drinking water limits until 2031 and reconsidering rules for other types of PFAS.
Sioux Falls plans to follow PFAS guidance from the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said Sioux Falls Public Works Director Mark Cotter. It’ll continue its monthly PFAS testing, Cotter added in an email, “which shows Sioux Falls’ drinking water is well within all health-based limits” set at the state and federal level.
The city expects to receive several more payments over the next decade from the 3M settlement, as well as chemical manufacturers DuPont, Tyco and BASF. The payments will be listed in the city’s monthly financial reports.

The state of South Dakota plans to open its own drinking water testing laboratory, and South Dakota State University researchers plan to test surface water and environmental samples, including animal tissue and plant material, to understand how the chemicals work their way through the food chain. The state is currently sampling South Dakota surface waters for PFAS, after the East Dakota Water Development District and South Dakota Mines found PFAS along the Big Sioux River watershed in the eastern part of the state last year. It is also offering free PFAS cleanup to local fire departments and schools throughout the state.
The Sioux Falls Regional Airport Authority also sued companies behind the firefighting foam in 2019, seeking damages for the cost of investigating and addressing the contamination. Dan Letellier, executive director, said the airport is part of a group of property and landowners set to go to trial or potentially settle.
Ellsworth, Box Elder continue investigation and mitigation of PFAS contamination
Other South Dakota communities have experienced PFAS contamination, including Box Elder near Ellsworth Air Force Base and wells at National Guard facilities near Custer and in Rapid City.
Ellsworth is one of many military installations throughout the country with PFAS contamination, South Dakota Ellsworth Development Authority Business Operations Manager Howie Aubertin told South Dakota Searchlight.
Groundwater and soil at Ellsworth Air Force Base were contaminated at a rate of up to 551,000 parts-per-trillion as of 2016, according to analysis of military records by Northeastern University and the Environmental Working Group.

The contamination affected dozens of families living near the base and on the western edge of Box Elder city limits. The property owners were provided bottled water, treatment systems for private wells or were hooked up to a waterline from the base.
Box Elder, Ellsworth Development Authority and Rapid City partnered to build a pipeline to transport water from Rapid City to about 35 impacted properties. Construction on the $12.5 million project, funded by the U.S. Air Force, began last year and is expected to finish by the end of the year, Aubertin said. The Air Force provided additional funding to widen the system and provide for the base’s future growth.
The base is still studying the extent of PFAS in non-drinking water sources around and near the base with plans to remedy the contamination. 
“The issue of PFAS at Ellsworth is not solved, and the Air Force recognizes that,” Aubertin said. “It is still in its investigative and exploratory phase.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/firefighting-foam-FEMA-photo-1024x512-1-e1682111382938.jpg,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

Jef Landry and state lawmakers are tearing down government ethics enforcement,"A longtime member of the Louisiana Board of Ethics accuess Gov. Jeff Landry and lawmakers of trying to dismantle ethics enforcement. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)The immediate past chairman of the Louisiana Board of Ethics said Gov. Jef Landry and state lawmakers are tearing down government ethics enforcement with the massive overhaul of ethics and campaign finance laws they enacted last month. 

“With these new changes, we are not slowly – we are expeditiously – veering into an arena into which we are being made nonessential,” said La Koshia Roberts, an attorney from Lake Charles who has served on the board since 2018 and is its longest-serving member. 
“They are hamstringing us,” she said in an interview following the board’s meeting Tuesday. “They are essentially dismantling the Board of Ethics starting with this legislation.” 

At the urging of Landry, state lawmakers passed sweeping changes to ethics and campaign finance laws last month that loosen dozens of existing restrictions on public servants, diminish government transparency and create new ways for people accused of government misconduct to push back on charges they face for allegedly breaking the law. 

The ethics board enforces statutes that are meant to protect the public against misconduct, inappropriate influence and favoritism in government. It oversees the conduct of elected officials, public employees, public contractors and lobbyists in state and local government. Everyone from the governor and state lawmakers to trash collectors and public school teachers are subject to its scrutiny. 

Roberts, who was appointed by the Louisiana House of Representatives, said the governor and legislators rewrote the ethics laws to benefit themselves. She said some adjustments had been made so that people who were not complying with the law will not be forced to do so. 
“They’ve done exactly what I thought they were going to do. They were going to carve out a law that was going to accommodate and satisfy certain people across the street,” who work in the Louisiana Capitol, Roberts said. 

In an interview after the meeting, Roberts said she was specifically referring to the governor and Louisiana Legislature when she mentioned “people across the street.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

She contends the law changes created a new hierarchy for ethics enforcement, in which the governor and legislators were entitled to flexibility that wasn’t afforded to public employees with less power.

“I know we don’t write the law, but it’s our job to apply the law which we’ve done for years now, but apparently, until just recently, certain people felt like they didn’t have to follow it and we should not apply it,” she said during the meeting. 
To what extent the governor or legislators have been investigated and reprimanded by the board is difficult to discern. It’s also hard to tell what laws changes might be in response to previous or ongoing investigations. 
The board’s deliberations only become public when it files charges or issues a fine. But it’s common for the board to drop an investigation or run out of time before completing it, which keeps the matter confidential. The board can also take other types of actions to reprimand someone that are secret, such as issuing a written warning.  

Board members and staff can face criminal charges for sharing information about ethics investigations considered privileged. 
Landry has had several run-ins with the board that have become public however. The board has repeatedly fined him for filing his campaign finance reports late, according to documents obtained through a public records request, and asked him to stop using his political funds to pay off his personal car loan. 

In the most high-profile incident, the board charged the governor two years ago, when he was still the state attorney general, with violating a government transparency law. Landry did not disclose to the ethics board that he had taken a flight to and from an attorneys general conference in Hawaii on a political donor’s private plane. 
His case has not been closed yet because the board and Landry are still negotiating over what the consequences should be for the violation. 
Landry’s attorneys have said the new ethics law will not impact his case. The portion of the law which he failed to follow aremained untouched in the recent law changes. 

Roberts  also accused legislators of attempting to intimidate the board last fall when a few attended a board executive session, which is not open to the public, in person. She said one of the lawmakers who came was Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, who is chairman of a legislative committee that handles ethics laws. 
At the time, the board and legislators were in a dispute over when the board should hire a new state ethics administrator, who serves the board’s attorney and who oversees ethics investigations. 
“It was only during that time that members of the legislature found it necessary to come in and sit in on our executive session,” she said. “And in my opinion, it was a way to try to bully this board to not conduct our business the way it should be conducted.”

The ethics board ended up hiring David Bordelon for the job on an interim basis in December, but only after legislators unsuccessfully sued to stop the selection process. 
The lawmakers were attempting to stall the hiring of a new administrator until at least January, when the makeup of the board changed with new appointees from Landry and the state lawmakers.

Colorado’s four Democratic representatives, Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood, voted against the bill. The four Republicans, Reps. Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction, Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton, voted for it. Colorado’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, voted against the bill when it was in the Senate on Tuesday.


Here is how members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted on Trump’s tax break and spending cut package:

Lauren Boebert (R): Yes
Jeff Crank (R): Yes
Jason Crow (D): No
Diana DeGette (D): No
Gave Evans (R): Yes
Jeff Hurd (R): Yes
Joe Neguse (D): No
Brittany Pettersen (D): No



“It’s deeply disappointing that all the Republican members of our delegation voted for this bill, despite being warned repeatedly of the damage it will cause for their constituents and our state,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement following the final vote. “Colorado Republicans and Trump now own the devastating impacts, cost increases, and chaos this bill will impose on hardworking Coloradans and Americans.”
Estimates suggest the measure could cause well over 100,000 Coloradans to lose Medicaid coverage. Tens of thousands of Coloradans could lose food assistance.
In his own statement, Evans called the bill a “bold, commonsense blueprint for how to secure the border, lower costs for families, crack down on dangerous illegal immigrants, and give local law enforcement the tools needed to keep our communities safe.”
Boebert said she took a cue from residents she represents.
“After listening to constituents and community leaders from across the 4th District and securing wins for Colorado, I am proud to vote YES on President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” she said in a statement.
The bill extends tax cuts established during Trump’s first term in 2017, boosts spending for defense and border security and creates new tax breaks on tips and overtime. It makes cuts to Medicaid spending, funding for nutritional assistance programs and eliminates some clean energy tax incentives created during the Biden administration.
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Colorado Democrats have repeatedly condemned the bill as it inched through the legislative process, claiming it will endanger the health care coverage of a huge swath of Coloradans, destroy clean and renewable energy projects, jeopardize food assistance for low-income families and blow a massive hole into an already tight state budget. State economists estimate the bill could decrease state revenues by as much as $500 million and increase costs to the state by around $500 million.
“The cruelty behind this bill is simply staggering, and it is all to appease the ego of Donald Trump and further his extreme and hateful agenda of mass deportations and his dangerous America Alone foreign policy,” DeGette said in a statement. “Our country is watching, and those who supported this horrific bill must justify taking Medicaid away from children, the disabled, our veterans, and senior citizens so that billionaires can get even more money in their pockets.”
State Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Democrat who chairs the state Joint Budget Committee, said in a statement that the bill will “almost certainly” force the Legislature into a special session to make further cuts to Colorado’s budget.
“Those cuts rest entirely at the feet of Gabe Evans, Jeff Hurd, and Donald Trump,” he said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Amid allegations of “gamesmanship” and forum shopping, a federal judge has blocked, at least for now, President Donald Trump’s attempt to move his lawsuit against the Des Moines Register and its pollster out of federal court and into state court.
Noting that Trump recently filed an appeal on one specific issue within the federal lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger found that because the president’s appeal had conferred jurisdiction of the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, he must first dismiss that appeal before voluntarily dismissing the underlying lawsuit.
For now, that means the president and his lawyers are pursuing the same legal case against the newspaper and pollster Ann Selzer in both state court and federal court.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was initiated in December 2024 when Trump sued the Register, its parent company, Gannett, and the Register’s former pollster, J. Ann Selzer, in Polk County District Court. The president alleged the newspaper’s Iowa Poll, which was published shortly before the Nov. 5 election, deliberately overstated support for the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, by 16 percentage points.
Trump argued the poll amounted to “brazen election interference” and violated Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act — claims the defendants have denied.
Attorneys for the president later expanded the lawsuit, adding claims by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican who narrowly won reelection in the state’s 1st Congressional District, and by Brad Zaun, a former Republican state senator from Urbandale, who lost his bid for reelection.
At the defendants’ request, the case was transferred to federal court. However, a legal dispute soon arose over whether federal court was the proper forum for the case given the fact that Miller-Meeks and Zaun, like the defendants, are based in Iowa.
On May 23, 2025, a federal judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court. In that decision, the court allowed the president to file an appeal on the issue but also ordered Trump to file an amended complaint removing Miller-Meeks and Zaun from the case, eliminating any claims that were exclusive to the two Iowa-resident plaintiffs.
Allegations of ‘gamesmanship’ and forum shopping
On May 23, 2025, the judge denied Trump’s motion to remand the case to state court. On June 2, 2025, lawyers for the president filed a petition for permission to appeal that decision, and the appeal itself was docketed that same day, according to court records.
Four weeks later, on June 30, 2025, Trump’s attorneys filed notice with the court that they were seeking to dismiss their federal lawsuit and, that day, they refiled the case in state court.
Lawyers for the Register objected, arguing that long-standing law bars litigants from dismissing a case they initiated “simply to avoid an adverse decision or seek a more favorable forum.”
The newspaper’s lawyers noted that in the federal case, Trump has lost his bid to have the case remanded to state court, lost his motion to stay the case, and been ordered to file a revised and amended complaint that conforms to the court’s orders.
The Register’s lawyers also argued the timing of the new state court lawsuit is “significant” in that it was filed just one day before Iowa’s Uniform Public Expression Protection Act, commonly known as an “anti-SLAPP law” that shields newspapers from baseless or frivolous claims, went into effect.
“This new legislation would apply to President Trump’s lawsuit,” the Register’s lawyers argued, calling the president’s actions an attempt to “escape the jurisdiction of the federal courts in time to restate his claims in Iowa’s state court without being subject to Iowa’s anti-SLAPP law.”
In response, lawyers for the president argued the “accusation of gamesmanship rings hollow” given the fact that the president first filed his case in state court only to see it see it moved to federal court at the newspaper’s urging. They also said the anti-SLAPP law isn’t applicable to their newly filed state case since it is based entirely on the lawsuit initially filed last December.
In ruling against the president on the dismissal of his federal case, Judge Ebinger noted that because Trump had not yet filed a motion to dismiss his June 2 appeal to the Eighth Circuit, she could “take no action that would affect the pending matter before the Eighth Circuit.” She stated that allowing the president to dismiss the underlying federal case would, for all practical purposes, “result in a dismissal of Trump’s appeal — which is procedurally improper.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-07-03 19:24:21+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Advocates say New Jersey budget falls short of affordable housing needs,Morgan Leason,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/07/03/advocates-say-new-jersey-budget-falls-short-of-affordable-housing-needs/,Advocates are sounding the alarm over the new state budget they say undercuts funding for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.,"Advocates say the budget state lawmakers approved Monday undercuts funding for affordable housing. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Advocates accused New Jersey lawmakers this week of underfunding affordable housing in the $58.8 billion annual budget they approved Monday.
The budget diverts money from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which supports the construction and preservation of housing for people earning at or below 80% of an area’s median income.
State officials anticipate collecting $130 million during the current fiscal year for the fund, but under the new budget will divert $125 million from affordable housing development and rehabilitation. That leaves just $5 million, which can only subsidize around 40 homes, according to the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.
The diverted funds will instead be used for programs that help first-generation home buyers and rental assistance, which were separate budget items in previous years, according to the Fair Share Housing Center.
Staci Berger, the network’s president and CEO, said the diversion contradicts years of coordinated planning with developers and investment in housing projects.
“It is tone-deaf and irresponsible to use this money for anything other than its intended purpose,” Berger told the New Jersey Monitor. 
A Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in May found that New Jersey residents support using the trust fund for its original purpose and enacting legislation to lower housing costs. More than half of New Jerseyans said their housing costs aren’t affordable and are getting worse, the poll found.
Jag Davies is a spokesman for the Fair Share Housing Center.
“Affordable housing benefits everyone in New Jersey, not just the residents, and addresses so many other social and economic problems at the root,” Davies said.
The disinvestment comes at a critical time, as July 1 marked the start of New Jersey’s fourth round of affordable housing obligations that go through 2035, Davies noted. By law, every municipality must submit a plan for how it will meet its affordable housing obligations. 
New Jersey has an affordable housing shortage of nearly 290,000 fewer affordable homes, according to the network. 
People of color are disproportionately impacted, Berger said. New Jersey’s persistent racial wealth gap is nearly double its pre-pandemic levels, the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice found in an April report.
“White folks have just significantly more wealth due to the equity in their homes, and unless we change the homeownership dynamic and undo 400-plus years of systemic and institutional racism that has permeated our lending market and our housing system, we aren’t really going to tackle that wealth gap in a meaningful way,” Berger said.
Still, the final budget was not without wins for people who need affordable housing. 
Lawmakers passed legislation in both houses allowing the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to distribute up to $100 million each year in tax credits to support the development or rehabilitation of affordable housing over coming years. The program does not replace the trust fund but will help, advocates say.

Advocates urged policymakers to support other proposals, some of which already are in the Statehouse pipeline, including: 

Raising the eviction filing fee as a deterrent for landlords and a revenue source to fund eviction prevention programs, such as emergency rental assistance.
Adding a surcharge on the sale of luxury homes.
Adding a luxury landlord fee that can be forgiven if the landlord provides affordable units with inclusionary zoning or caps rent increases.

“Legislators need to urgently prioritize protecting vulnerable tenants and facilitating affordable housing development,” Davies said. “Without enhanced tenant protections, New Jersey and other states around the country are going to see a massive wave of evictions in the coming months and years.”

[…]","Republican Rep. Tim Fleming of Covington has become the first candidate to launch a bid for Georgia secretary of state in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderState Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, has become the first candidate to launch a bid for secretary of state, seeking to replace Brad Raffensperger as Georgia’s top election official.
“Yesterday, I took the necessary steps to formally begin preparing a campaign for Georgia Secretary of State,” Fleming wrote in a post on Facebook Thursday.
“An official announcement will be made at the appropriate time, but in the meantime, I look forward to continuing meaningful conversations with Georgians across this great state about the challenges we face and the future we can build together with strong conservative leadership,” he added.
The secretary of state is responsible for overseeing elections across the state, granting business licenses for a variety of professions, and managing Georgia’s securities market. The role soared to new prominence after the 2020 presidential election, when Raffensperger, a Republican, resisted pressure from President Donald Trump to overturn Georgia’s election results in his favor. 
In the years since, the Republican-controlled state Legislature and State Election Board have sought to strip power from the office, removing Raffensperger from his former position as chair of the State Election Board before ousting him from the board altogether. The Georgia GOP has also imposed sanctions on Raffensperger, passing a resolution to ban him from qualifying as a Republican in future elections.

Raffensperger, who first became secretary of state in 2019, has not announced whether he intends to run again for the seat in 2026. But Fleming, a business owner and outspoken supporter of the president, may be positioning himself to be a more Trump-aligned alternative. Raffensperger beat a Trump-backed challenger in 2022. 
First elected to represent Georgia House District 114 in 2022, Fleming previously worked as Gov. Brian Kemp’s chief of staff. According to his campaign website, he also served as deputy secretary of state under Kemp, who was Georgia’s top election official from 2010 until 2018. 
Fleming has helped shape election policy in his brief time in the General Assembly. During his first term in the Legislature, he successfully passed House Bill 1207, a bill initially aimed at revising ballot proofing procedures for local superintendents. However, it was later amended to include language from Senate Bill 221, a controversial elections bill that failed to pass during the 2023 legislative session. Among other changes, the legislation required all election workers to be U.S. citizens, outlined protections for poll watchers and eliminated the requirement for polling places to maintain a ratio of one voting machine for every 250 voters. The governor signed HB 1207 into law in May 2024.
Earlier this year, Fleming also introduced a controversial election bill that would prohibit Georgia from sharing voter information with third-party groups like the Electronic Registration Information Center, limit voters’ ability to drop off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day and expand poll-watching areas, among other provisions. The bill successfully passed through both chambers, but failed to gain final passage before the Legislature adjourned.
He was also appointed to lead this year’s House Blue-Ribbon Study Committee on Election Procedures, which is expected to evaluate Georgia’s current election policies and provide recommendations for new election laws ahead of Georgia’s 2026 legislative session. The study committee will hold its first meeting in Atlanta on July 15.

Don Bacon ultimately followed along.","There was no political surprise from the all-Republican Nebraska federal delegationLINCOLN — Republican leadership on the Hill successfully wrangled enough Senate and House Republicans, including the Nebraska federal delegation, into supporting President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.” 
The bill passed the U.S. House along party lines, 218-214, and will now be sent to the president to be signed into law. There was no political surprise from the all-Republican Nebraska federal delegation, who spent the week defending the GOP mega bill through national interviews on the Hill.
“We’re delivering on President Trump’s growth agenda,” Rep. Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, told Fox Business. “This is about growth.” 
The only two House Republicans to vote against the bill were Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.
Earlier this week, the GOP mega bill passed the Senate after an overnight session, with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance. U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts have been interviewed about what they said is the importance of preserving Trump’s tax cuts. In a trend, Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Rep. Don Bacon vocally pushed back, expressing concerns about the Senate version of the bill’s proposed cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that he had received reassurances the bill would not degrade the quality of healthcare for people covered by Medicaid. 
He even said he won’t support the Senate’s reconciliation bill if it cut the Medicaid provider tax rate. 
But in the end, he voted for it. Bacon defended his vote, like the rest of the delegation, by emphasizing the preservation of the Trump tax cuts. 
“I wish they had done the house … version,” Bacon told CNN, “But I have an opportunity to protect taxpayers … from a 20% tax increase.” 
BREAKING: US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said on the House floor, “We’re stopping a tax increase on the average middle class household.” 
Trump and Republican leadership in Congress successfully made their self-imposed deadline of July 4 to get the “big beautiful bill” to the president’s desk. Now the delegation will try to sell the bill to Nebraskans, as multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it.
The bill would make tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, boosts funding for immigration enforcement, starts funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplishes other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda.
To offset the cost of the mega bill, the plan is to reduce spending on the social safety net by adding work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, and would lower provider taxes, a tax nearly every state uses to help fund Medicaid programs. 
Congressional experts have estimated that the package would add $3.253 trillion to the debt during the next decade. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also estimates that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage due to the stricter requirements, which are expected to save the federal government $280 billion over the next six years. 
The bill would require able-bodied people and working-aged individuals to show the government proof of employment to remain on the program every six months. For months, state lawmakers, left-leaning political advocacy organizations, medical professionals, activists and some everyday Nebraskans have expressed concerns about the “disastrous” consequences of the mega bill’s Medicaid cuts for healthcare access and to rural hospitals.
Trump’s mega bill includes $50 billion for rural hospitals as an attempt to offset Medicaid cuts, but according to KFF, a health research organization, analysis, those cuts could decrease Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over the next decade.  
In Nebraska, it’s estimated that the state would lose between $3 billion and $5 billion in Medicaid federal funding over the next 10 years, according to KKF. The director of the Nebraska Rural Health Association stated that six rural Nebraska hospitals would likely close as a result. 
A rural hospital in southwest Nebraska, Curtis Medical Center, has already announced plans to close in the coming months because of the anticipated Medicaid cuts. 
“Unfortunately, the current financial environment, driven by anticipated federal budget cuts to Medicaid, has made it impossible for us to continue operating all of our services, many of which have faced significant financial challenges for years,” Troy Bruntz, president and CEO of Community Hospital, said in a news release.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers this week renewed state funding to protect access to reproductive health services in New Jersey, while private fundraising for abortion has soared — both trends abortion-rights advocates here hope will offset federal funding cuts Congress approved.
Legislators in Trenton passed a $58.8 billion budget Monday that contained $22.3 million for family planning care; staff recruitment, retention and training for reproductive health care providers; and security improvements and technology upgrades for abortion clinics, among other reproductive health care services.
While the budget contained other cuts and diversions that drove advocates and even some members of Gov. Phil Murphy’s cabinet to protest, lawmakers maintained the same level of state funding for reproductive health care as they’ve allocated in recent years, said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey.
She applauded the support, calling reproductive health care “a fundamental right and a critical component of both public health and the state’s economic vitality.”
“With mounting attacks from a president and Congress who are hostile toward reproductive rights, threatening access to reproductive health care including abortion, we urge New Jersey elected officials to continue to prioritize reproductive health by working to offset future funding shortfalls resulting from federal attacks and by continuing to implement policies and programs that overcome barriers to accessing care,” Wojtowicz said.
The federal budget bill passed by the Senate Tuesday and the House Thursday prohibits federal Medicaid funding from going to large health care clinics that provide abortions, effectively defunding Planned Parenthood clinics.
The Hyde Amendment bars the use of federal funds for abortion with a few exceptions, but Planned Parenthood clinics rely heavily on Medicaid funding, not for abortions, but instead to provide standard reproductive health care at low to no cost, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings.
The cuts, consequently, could jeopardize health care for 1.1 million patients and drive almost 200 Planned Parenthood clinics to close nationally, Wojtowicz said.
In New Jersey, Planned Parenthood staff see about 133,000 patients a year, and a third of them rely on Medicaid, she added.
“There will definitely be an impact in New Jersey,” she said.
The bill will “gut access to reproductive health care,” agreed Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.
“Medicaid is not a luxury — it’s a lifeline,” Baden said in a statement. “It ensures access to essential care, including sexual and reproductive health services, for millions of people. Slashing this program to finance tax cuts for the wealthy is not just wrong — it’s cruel.”
New Jersey’s Congressional delegation split on the bill along party lines, with Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and the eight Democratic Congress members voting against it and Republican Reps. Jeff Van Drew, Tom Kean Jr., and Chris Smith voting in favor.
The bill now goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.
 Private funding up 
As threats to public funding for reproductive health care have grown, private fundraising for reproductive health services has risen.
The New Jersey Abortion Access Fund, a volunteer-run nonprofit that pays for abortions for women who can’t afford them, has seen its donations jump 61% in the past year, said Quadira Coles, the fund’s board president.
Donations have soared more than 900% since 2022, Coles added. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion in a landmark ruling known as Dobbs, clearing the way for states to restrict or ban the procedure.
The fund gave out $39,000 to 145 patients in 2021, and by 2024, it helped 1,140 patients by funding $427,954 in care, Coles said.
Planned Parenthood also privately fundraises and has similarly seen a spike in support, Wotjowicz said.
“After Dobbs, there were a lot of supporters, volunteers, and donors who wanted to help, and one of the ways that the affiliates have been trying to funnel that energy is to patient assistance — helping patients get to New Jersey, providing them lodging when they’re here, or helping them have a hot meal while they’re traveling from Alabama or Louisiana,” Wotjowicz said.
In other states where abortion is restricted, some donors have stopped or scaled back their giving, fearing they could be held criminally or civilly liable for aiding and abetting abortion, Coles said.
That hasn’t happened in New Jersey — yet, she said.
New Jersey policymakers passed a law in 2022 barring the extradition of people involved in reproductive health services to other states that have restricted or criminalized abortion.
But abortion foes “are getting more creative” in their fight, Coles said.
“The more we do good, the more they find ways to attack our work,” she said.
Uncertainty persists because of the coming general election too, she added.
New Jersey voters will pick a new governor to replace Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who has codified abortion rights statewide. U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who supports abortion rights, and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican, are running to replace him. Ciattarelli has said he is “pro-choice … up to 20 weeks,” but Sherrill last week warned that Ciattarelli is a “Trump lackey” who would threaten women’s rights on multiple fronts.
“Whoever becomes the governor next could really change the abortion-access landscape here,” Coles said.

The Mississippi Department of Education on Tuesday disbanded the Mississippi Achievement School District, which consolidated the struggling school districts in 2019 into a single one under direct state supervision. 
The Legislature created the Mississippi Achievement School District in 2016 to target the lowest-performing schools in the state. Yazoo City and Humphreys County, both majority-Black and low-income areas, were the district’s inaugural school systems. 
But House Bill 1696 passed in 2024 — co-authored by Democratic Rep. Timaka James-Jones, who represents Humphreys — dissolved the Mississippi Achievement School District starting July 1, 2025. 

State Rep. Timaka James-Jones speaks during a press conference  at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson, Miss., on Monday, April 14, 2025. Credit: Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today
Republican Rep. Kent McCarty of Lamar County, who authored the bill as vice-chair of the House Education Committee, said the legislation was aimed at giving districts more control.
“I hope the extra flexibility allows them to move toward more independence,” McCarty said Thursday. “Eventually, we’d love to see every district function independently without oversight from the department and make the improvements they need to be high-performing districts.”
But that doesn’t mean the districts are fully back to local control. They’ve just separated and become “districts of transformation” — a different, more widespread framework for low-performing schools to improve their student achievement. 
School systems can become districts of transformation if they consistently receive failing grades in the state’s accountability report card. Under that model, those districts have to develop and implement improvement plans. They get support from the state education department and are closely overseen by the agency. State takeovers can mean more teaching observations and frequent classroom visits from administrators. 
Since 1996, school districts have been taken over using the “district of transformation” model 23 times. Four districts currently operate under the model: Holmes, Noxubee, Humphreys County and Yazoo City.
Earl Watkins, who previously managed the Humphreys County and Yazoo City schools as superintendent of the achievement district, will take the helm of the Yazoo City school district, while Stanley Ellis will lead the Humphrey County district. 
The two superintendents will still answer directly to the state Board of Education.
That’ll be the case for at least one more year — both Yazoo City and Humphreys County received “C” marks on their state report card this past school year, so if they receive “C” grades this year, they still need one more consecutive year of that grade or higher to regain local control. 
“With the scores we have, we’re well on the way to the next steps,” James-Jones said. “It really does boost the pride of our community and we have this united goal now. We’re looking forward to our students getting everything that they need to be successful.”
Humphreys, which received a “D” rating during the 2023-2024 school year, made a “C” by two points.
The growth was largely due to higher scores among the bottom 25% of 3rd to 8th grade students in math and English. Both English and math test scores are given extra weight along with any improvements made by students in the bottom 25%.
Yazoo City raised its grade from an “F” through similar means, with math students in the bottom 25% showing more growth from last year. 
Tenashe White, who teaches 8th grade math in Humphreys, gives credit foremost to her students. But she also acknowledges the help of educational consultants and her fellow teachers who helped plan activities that helped students master math standards through play.
“We threw math bowls, science bowls, spelling competitions to kind of open it up more so they can have some fun but also perform on the tests,” White said. “We had different incentives like ice cream socials.”
Ellis started as the Humphreys superintendent Tuesday. He said anyone who’s not focused on teaching and learning will find themselves “out of place” at the district. 
“Our motto is, ‘New day, new direction,’” he said. “This is our opportunity to get a new start.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03134307/IMG_6508.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

They were married in 1979 and moved to Topeka in the 1980s. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly confirmed that she and her husband of more than 40 years were granted a divorce.
She decided to speak publicly about the amicable end of her marriage because of inquiries about the status of her relationship with retired physician Ted Daughety.
Kelly, 75, said the pair remained on friendly terms before and after the divorce was finalized in October. They were married in 1979 and have two adult daughters.
“Throughout my time in public office, I’ve always guarded my family’s privacy. It’s been my policy to keep my personal life separate from my public one to the extent possible,” Kelly said.
She said it had “come to my attention that my marital status has become a topic of some speculation, so I will share that Ted and I divorced in October of 2024.”
“It was amicable and mutual, and we both continue to share in the lives of our family,” the governor said.
The Democratic governor’s brief statement Thursday was the first official confirmation of a split. The governor resides at the Topeka residence for Kansas governors known as Cedar Crest. Her family home in the Potwin neighborhood of central Topeka has been sold.
In a statement, Daughety said that “Laura and I made this decision together, based on what worked best for us and for our family.”
Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate to represent a Topeka-area district in 2005 and remained in that job for nearly 15 years. She was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022.
Daughety was a pulmonary and sleep disorder specialist who practiced medicine for decades in Kansas.
Divorce among sitting U.S. governors hasn’t been common, but Democrat John Carlin ended two marriages while serving as governor of Kansas.
Carlin took office in 1979 and received a divorce from Ramona Hawkinson in 1980. Carlin and his second wife, Karen Bigsby Hurley, were divorced in 1985 during his second term.

Jahana Hayes argued provisions in the bill are ‘direct attacks on our youngest generation’ based on implications for education and SNAP.,"Connecticut Democrats once again voted against President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” as Republicans took their final step Thursday afternoon to pass much of his second-term agenda. The vote came after significant delays and the arm-twisting of holdouts, but Republicans got it done before their self-imposed deadline of July 4.
The House voted 218-214 largely along party lines, with only two Republicans opposed and all five Democratic members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation voting against it. Major divisions held up the bill Wednesday, with a bloc of Republicans raising concerns about the changes made by the Senate and wanting it to look like the original House bill. Leadership held a procedural vote open for multiple hours as they worked to get enough support, making it the longest vote in the history of the lower chamber.
A subsequent procedural vote to move to final passage also stalled late Wednesday and into the early morning. But Congress finished the monthslong process of crafting and passing a bill through budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on votes from Democrats. And Republicans ultimately met their goal of getting a bill to Trump’s desk before the holiday.
“Some of us have literally been up for days now, but this day is a hugely important one in the history of our nation,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said just before the final vote.
“Today for us was about results. Democrats deliver performances and Republicans deliver results,” he added, referencing the House Democratic leader’s speech railing against the bill that broke the record for longest floor speech. “We’re going to deliver what we were sent here to do and every American will benefit from it.” 
Trump is expected to sign the bill on Friday.
The House initially passed its own version of the sweeping bill in late May, but it inevitably faced major changes as it made its way over to the Senate. On Tuesday, the Senate narrowly advanced its own legislation, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie and casting the deciding vote. The House needed to take another vote on the Senate-amended version before it fully cleared Congress and could get signed into law.
With Republicans in full control of Congress and the White House, Democrats were left out of the mix and with no negotiating power. But they sought to delay procedural votes on the bill, a symbolic move to show their support for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
And as they were winding down Thursday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., spoke for nearly nine hours before the final vote and read stories of people across the U.S. who rely on different government services that are at risk. That delayed the vote until midafternoon.
And on Wednesday, more than 100 members — including U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District — spent nearly an hour making unanimous consent requests to amend the rule on the bill.
“Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to make an order the amendment at the desk that protects against any cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Hayes and other lawmakers said as they went one by one to make the request on the House floor. Republicans objected to each request.
States and their finances will likely take some of the biggest hits as they account for new changes and shifts in funding for social services. That could end up having a ripple effect on how their residents qualify for certain programs like Medicaid and SNAP or reduce benefits.
“This bill is going to have devastating impacts on millions of Americans for years to come and was passed for the sole purpose of giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,” said Gov. Ned Lamont, in a statement. “It will amount to a massive income transfer from the poorest and most vulnerable Americans to the wealthiest. Not only does this plan bankrupt the federal government, but it slashes critical safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and SNAP, that so many hard-working American families need for their health and survival.”
Connecticut officials said they are monitoring what the federal bill means for the state and the services it provides, particularly surrounding health care.
“I’d like [Connecticut residents] to know that we are incredibly vigilant around this,” Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror Thursday.
“Many of us doing this work are not sleeping because we’re extraordinarily concerned about people falling off the rolls and being without health care,” she added. The state is “trying to do all that we can to try to preserve as much coverage under the new federal rules as we possibly can and we will help them navigate the changes.”
Lamont said his administration is “dedicated to doing what we can do mitigate some of the impact of what this bill will cause, but with a federal administration insistent on eliminating critical safety nets it is going to be nearly impossible for any state to backfill the billions in federal cuts we are going to face.”
He said he would be meeting with state lawmakers to analyze the bill and determine its impact on the state budget.
Democrats argue the bill will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services. And they have been highlighting the painstakingly long votes and tight margins in both chambers to show that even some Republicans are skeptical about the bill.

At a Congressional Black Caucus press conference Wednesday, Hayes argued the provisions in the bill are “direct attacks on our youngest generation” based on the implications it has on education and SNAP.
And she said it could further hurt communities that are disproportionately affected by food insecurity. She noted that nearly 27% of Black families are SNAP recipients.
Cuts to SNAP could also have additional implications for kids beyond the home. She said that if children no longer get SNAP benefits, that could also result in them losing access to free or reduced-price lunches at school since schools get reimbursed for serving meals to eligible students. Kids on SNAP automatically qualify for such meals.
“We can afford to feed children in the United States of America and even more, we can afford to educate children in the United States of America,” Hayes said. “Republicans are not just cutting budgets, they’re cutting futures.”
The bill seeks to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during Trump’s first term and will expire at the end of the year. It would also steer billions of dollars in immigration funding, including money for a border wall and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And it would phase out clean energy tax credits passed during the Biden administration related to electric vehicles and consumer tax credits.
The legislation would make many of the tax breaks permanent from 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including lower income tax rates. A number of tax provisions were amended or narrowed in the Senate bill.
The bill raises the $10,000 threshold on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. It raises the cap through 2029, which would return to the current threshold after that.
If the cap increases, it would be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut. In 2022, state taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
Other tax provisions would permanently raise the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 starting in 2026, with one parent who needs to have a Social Security number to claim it. Some workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax, but those tax breaks would expire at the end of 2028. And seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes would be able to make an additional $6,000 deduction for the next few years.
To pay for these tax provisions, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs and state finances.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult between 19 and 64, a recipient would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month, though there are some exemptions. States will need to check on eligibility more often.
Work requirements will also apply to adults with children who are 14 years and older. It also adds a provision that blocks Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Federal law already prohibits funding going toward abortions with a few exceptions, but it could threaten other services those clinics provide like cancer screenings, birth control and other types of routine care.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal legislation, estimated that about 138,000 people could lose Medicaid coverage in Connecticut, with the higher end of enrollment loss up to 172,000. That estimate is based off of the House version of the bill.
On SNAP benefits, more older Americans will need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. It also changes the age of a dependent regarding SNAP. Now, able-bodied adults with children 14 and older will fall under the new work requirement.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history as well as take on more of the administrative costs. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts if states cannot fill in the gap.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.Nurses in the Twin Cities said Thursday they called off a strike planned for next week after reaching a tentative deal with hospitals over accusations of unfair labor practices, including hospitals allegedly failing to negotiate in good faith.
But nurses and other health care providers in the Duluth area still plan to go on strike starting Tuesday, according to the Minnesota Nurses Association. 
Union leaders have said since bargaining began in March that increasing nurse staffing levels statewide was their No. 1 priority. They said this would ensure better care for patients, decrease burnout, and lessen violence against health care workers.
Striking, the union said, was the tool to force hospitals to negotiate in good faith. The Minnesota Nurses Association said in a press release Thursday that nurses resolved the unfair labor practice as part of the agreement they reached. 
“Nurses have always said this fight isn’t just about contracts, it’s about safe care,” association President Chris Rubesch said in the release. “We’ve been fighting an uphill battle. The campaign may be over for now in the Metro, but the fight for safe staffing and patient care is far from over.”
Nurses and employers in the Twin Cities were negotiating into the early hours of the morning Thursday, the union said. The agreement they reached includes a 10% raise over three years, language to put Minnesota’s break law into place and provisions on workplace violence. 
The hospital systems that reached a tentative agreement include Allina Health, Children’s Minnesota, M Health Fairview, Health Partners and North Memorial Health, according to the union. 
The Twin Cities Hospitals Group and Minnesota Hospital Association, which include hospitals involved in negotiations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The negotiations come as Congress debates the GOP budget bill that would significantly cut Medicaid, a joint federal and state-funded program that pays medical providers for their care. 
Over 1.2 million Minnesotans receive health care through Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance in Minnesota, and the congressional cuts would impact people’s health care coverage or their ability to access care. Many of Minnesota’s rural hospitals see a high rate of Medicaid patients, and their costs could increase if they don’t receive government compensation for the care they offer.
Although Twin Cities nurses have reached a tentative agreement, members will still need to vote on their final contract. Nurses and advanced practice providers in Duluth are set to move forward with their unfair labor practices strike on July 8 and July 10, respectively.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/P1094691-copy-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

(Courtesy New Mexico Department of Game and Fish)A bill introduced Monday, proposing to strip endangered species protections from Mexican gray wolves would mean “unrecoverable losses” for the Southwestern wolves, wildlife advocates said.
Arizona Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar’s bill, “Enhancing Safety for Animals Act,” would remove the wolf from the federal list of endangered species and end U.S. population restoration efforts in Mexico. Gosar’s office issued a news release saying “significant attacks by wolves on cattle, elk, moose, and sheep have occurred and have negatively impacted hunters and ranchers throughout Arizona.”
Delisting would also end federal investigation into wolf predation on livestock and reduce federal funding for livestock losses, Michelle Lute, executive director for Wildlife for All, told Source NM, and would further erode recovery programs.
“Stripping federal protections for Mexican gray wolves would invite another extinction,” Lute said. “This is not alarmist, this is what we’re already seeing.”
Mexican gray wolves once lived throughout the mountains and deserts of New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico, but were driven to near-extinction by the 1970s due to years of eradication to keep them from preying on cattle.
Outlook for Mexican gray wolf still positive, despite recent death

Two years after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, U.S. Fish and Wildlife added the Mexican gray wolf to the list, garnering federal protections. Officials captured the seven remaining wild wolves, and bred them back from extinction. Federal wildlife officials reintroduced the wolves in Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. Today, the national wild population is 286 animals. Reintroduction in Mexico occurred in 2011.
Tensions over the wolf introduction program have escalated in New Mexico, culminating in Catron and Sierra county boards issuing disaster declarations in resolutions earlier this year and asking state officials to step in, end federal wolf releases into the wild and kill wolves that prey on livestock.
Federal delisting would remove federal prohibitions on killing wolves, said Michael Robinson, senior conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“Bypassing the Endangered Species Act to strip all protections from beleaguered Mexican gray wolves and leave them vulnerable to Arizona’s shoot-on-sight laws would cause a massacre,” Robinson said in a statement. “The Southwest’s ecology would suffer, and we’d be left with a sadder, drabber landscape if Gosar and the livestock industry’s cruel vision for wolf extermination becomes law.”

,DC,2025-07-03 18:47:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"How the megabill allows Trump to expand mass deportations, curb immigrant benefits",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-megabill-allows-trump-expand-mass-deportations-curb-immigrant-benefits,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill cleared early Thursday has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown, helping fulfill the president’s 2024 campaign promise of mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.The measure, passed by the House 218-214, would fulfil several of Trump’s key immigration priorities, such as bolstering border security, increasing immigration detention capacity and adding fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.While most of the immigration-related provisions in the massive bill would vastly expand immigration enforcement, it also aims to limit benefits currently extended to some immigrants with legal status.Immigrants with a lawful status, including asylum, under the bill would be ineligible to receive food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Immigrants without legal status or authorization to be in the country are already ineligible for SNAP benefits, which roughly 42 million people rely on.The bill could also cut off tax benefits from mixed-status families, in which family members have different immigration statuses.For example, while Republicans would raise the child tax credit to $2,200 per eligible child, the bill would exclude that benefit to U.S. citizen children who are born to immigrant parents without legal status. The proposal would require that the parent applying for the child tax credit also have a Social Security number.The 870-page megabill was passed by the Senate 51-50 on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote.Here’s an overview of what else the bill will do:Immigration enforcementThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.Those funds would go toward hiring 10,000 ICE officers within five years. The money would also pay for retention bonuses, transportation of immigrants, upgrades of ICE facilities, detainment of families, and the hiring of ICE immigration lawyers for enforcement and removal proceedings in immigration court.An ICE signing bonus would be given to those hired after the bill is signed into law, and as a retention bonus if an ICE agent has five years of service specifically dealing with immigration enforcement. The bill does not specify how much a signing bonus or retention bonus should be.The Senate’s version provides ICE with added flexibility in which areas to allocate the nearly $30 billion.DOD fundingSeparately from ICE, the bill would include $1 billion for the Department of Defense to deploy military personnel for border-related operations, construction and temporary detention on military installations.Trump in April directed several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border as he continues to intertwine the U.S. military with his administration’s immigration crackdown.Created was a military buffer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, California and New Mexico. It means that any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, and therefore allows active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.National and military experts have raised concerns that militarizing that strip of land could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement.Additionally, the Trump administration last month deployed 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, amid major protests that arose after immigration agents began targeting day laborers at Home Depots for immigration enforcement.DetentionThe bill sets aside $45 billion for building new centers to detain immigrants, from single individuals to families. It’s a more than 300% increase from ICE’s fiscal year 2024 budget for detaining immigrants, which was about $9 billion. Building new detention centers takes time, so private prison companies such as CoreCivic and GEO Group are likely to enter into more contracts with ICE.Those companies have begun expanding detention capacity. CoreCivic last month acquired a 736-bed facility in Virginia and GEO this month purchased a 770-bed facility in western California.Border securityThe bill would allocate $46.6 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to construct a wall along the U.S. Mexico border, as well as make any repairs. That would be more than three times what the first Trump administration spent on barriers at the southern border, at roughly $15 billion.Some of the technology that would be added on the border includes cameras, lights, sensors, and other detection improvements. The funds would be used beginning in fiscal year 2025 until Sept. 30, 2029.Another $4.1 billion would go toward hiring CBP personnel, until the end of September 2029. Another $2 billion would go toward retention and bonuses for CBP personnel.The bill would also set aside $855 million for the repair of vehicles that CBP officers use. Republicans included $5 billion for upgrades and repairs at CBP facilities.Additionally, $6.1 billion would go toward buying nonintrusive equipment to detect illicit narcotics at ports of entry along the southwest, northern and maritime borders.Also, any immigrant without legal authorization and who is apprehended at a port of entry would be subject to a $5,000 fine.There is currently a civil fine ranging from $50 to $250. Asylum-seekers typically surrender themselves at ports of entry.Legal immigration pathways, application feesThe bill would give the Department of Justice roughly $3.3 billion for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to prosecute immigration matters, such as noncitizen voting – something that is extremely rare – and violations of the Alien Registration Act.In April, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that immigrants in the country without legal authorization were required to register with the agency or face jail time and a fine of up to $5,000.The bill would also provide funding for the hiring of immigration judges, but will cap the number of judges at 800. There are roughly 700 now, amid a 3.5 million case backlog in immigration court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.The bill would also overhaul immigration fees and application fees for immigrants seeking legal pathways, both permanent and temporary.For the first time, there would be a fee to apply for asylum, set at $100. There are no fee waivers for nearly every new fee set or increased by the bill, except for applications dealing with unaccompanied minors. All fees would also be subject to adjustment for inflation. Asylum-seekers who want to apply for initial work permits would also have to pay another fee of $550, something that is currently free.For an asylum applicant wanting to renew work permits, the bill would lower the cost to $275, where it is currently $470 to renew online and $520 to mail in the paperwork.For immigrants on Temporary Protected Status, meaning the DHS secretary has deemed the immigrant's home country too dangerous to return to, the fee to apply would be $500. It’s currently $50.The fee to apply for humanitarian relief would increase to $1,000, where it is currently $630.The bill would slightly increase the initial work application fee for TPS holders and those with humanitarian status to $550, up from a $470 fee for submitting online and $520 to mail in the paperwork.To renew those work permits, the bill would lower the cost to $275, down from $470 for online and $520 for mail.The nonimmigrant visa, which is currently free and handled by the State Department, would now cost $250 under the bill. This visa is typically used for international students, agricultural workers and other special skilled immigrant labor.Unaccompanied immigrant childrenSome of the $2 billion in funding for DHS would go toward removing unaccompanied children under certain circumstances. That includes if the child is found by a port of entry, is not a victim of human trafficking, and does not fear returning to their home country.The bill would also provide a $300 million fund for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which handles unaccompanied children, to conduct background checks and home studies on any potential sponsor of an unaccompanied child.There would also be funding to check children in ORR custody for their potential criminal and gang history. Those 12 and older would be subject to examinations “for gang-related tattoos and other gang-related markings,” according to the bill.The special juvenile immigrant visa, which is for immigrant children who are either abandoned or abused by a parent, and allows them to apply for lawful permanent resident status, would now cost $250 under the bill, but the fee could be waived. It’s currently free.State grants, World Cup and OlympicsThe bill would also give some states $450 million for the Operation Stonegarden Grant Program, which gives funding to states and local governments that participate in border enforcement.The bill would help states that are hosting major sporting events such as the World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028.The bill allocates $625 million for security and other costs related to the FIFA World Cup and $1 billion for security and planning costs for the Olympics, which Los Angeles is hosting in 2028.",,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

Leading the appointments as the city’s interim chief administrative officer, Pieter Teeuwissen, a former Hinds County Court Judge who served as city attorney under former mayors Harvey Johnson and Frank Melton. 
The chief administrative officer is a vital position in Jackson City Hall as Teeuwissen will essentially serve as the deputy mayor, with most of the city’s departments reporting to him. So far, Teeuwissen said the job has mostly entailed a lot of reading in preparation for the city’s intensive budget process. 
“How do we craft a budget with audits that are now three years old?” Teeuwissen said, referring to the city’s failure to complete timely audits in recent years. “That would be the issue, and if you ask me next Monday, that’s gonna be the issue. Next Tuesday, next Wednesday, until we get a budget done.”
Willie Bozeman, Horhn’s campaign manager, will serve as interim chief of staff. Horhn’s appointments can serve in an interim capacity for 90 days, and Horhn must put their name on the agenda to be confirmed by the Jackson City Council before that time period is up.

Other new faces in the administration include: 

ReSean Thomas, a former leader of the firefighters union who helped secure pay raises in recent years, will serve as interim fire chief;
Von Anderson, who oversaw communications for Horhn’s transition team after serving as the chief commercial officer for the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, will be the interim director of planning and development;
Grace Fisher, a former communications director at the Mississippi Department of Corrections and editor at the Clarion Ledger, will serve as interim communications director;
Pearlean Campbell, former victim services director at MDOC, will serve as interim constituent services director;
Nathan Slater, a local technology consultant, will oversee the IT department;
and Jamal Sibley, a staff on the Horhn campaign, will serve as interim special assistant to the mayor. 

Slater has already started working on the city’s website and said he hopes to roll out a new one within 30 days. 
Of the directors Horhn has retained from former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s leadership team, the most notable is Fidelis Malembeka, the chief financial officer. 
Other holdovers include City Attorney Drew Martin, Municipal Clerk Angela Harris, Police Chief Joe Wade, and Director of Human Resources, Toya Martin.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices. 
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday. 
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.” 
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank. 
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time. 
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.” 
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Laura Kelly said states cannot make up the financial losses from the “disastrous budget” in H.R. 1, which the president refers to as “one, big beautiful bill.” The House passed the measure on Thursday, sending it to the president for his signature.
“While Washington Republicans continue to talk about ‘cost shifts,’ Democratic governors have been clear that it will be impossible for states to respond to such massive cuts by backfilling with state resources,” Kelly said. “We cannot gut health care or let children go hungry in the name of giving tax breaks to the wealthy.”
The bill was passed by the Senate on Wednesday, with Kansas Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran voting in favor.
In the House, Kansas Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, was the sole vote from the Sunflower State against the bill, with Republican Reps. Tracey Mann, Ron Estes and Derek Schmidt voting to pass.
Kansas stands to see costs for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program increase by at least $15 million, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
That’s what it will cost Kansas to make up its share of administrative costs. The match is currently 50/50 and the bill increases that to a 75/25 split, La Row said. In federal fiscal year 2025, Kansas paid just more than $30 million for its share, and that would increase to about $45 million.
Kansas would take an even larger financial hit in the state-federal cost share for SNAP benefits.
The bill penalizes states that have larger than acceptable error rates in processing SNAP benefits. Kansas had an error rate in 2023 of 12%. La Row said its 2024 rate dropped to 9.98%, which puts the state in a category to cost-share 10% of the $413 million in SNAP benefits that were issued.
“The state would have to cost share just over $41 million (10%) under the Senate version,” La Row said in an email. “These changes would become effective Oct. 1, 2027.”
If Kansas lowers its error rate to 5% or less, the bill drops cost-sharing to zero. 
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins said in a news release that Gov. Laura Kelly was “fearmongering” about possible budget effects. He referred to the 2023 error rate of 12% as the highest in the region and said Kelly and DCF failed to comply with federal demands to improve efficiency.
“If Governor Kelly truly wants to avoid a hole in the state budget, she needs to stop pointing fingers at the Trump Administration and focus on her own Administration’s repeated failure to effectively manage the SNAP program,” Hawkins said. “A 12% error rate is unacceptable. Hard stop.”
The solution is to drop the error rate to 5% or below, he said, and the state budget won’t be affected.
 
Medicaid costs
Kansans also can expect to see Medicaid cuts that will jeopardize Kansas hospitals and nursing homes, according to reports by the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and the REACH Healthcare Foundation. 
Kansas stands to lose nearly $3.9 billion in Medicaid funding, with Kansas hospitals standing to lose as much as $2.65 billion in funding over 10 years, the two organizations said in a news release.
A report from the National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, released Tuesday, found that rural hospitals will lose 21 cents out of every dollar they receive for funding Medicaid, the joint state and federal public health insurance program that serves more than 360,000 Kansans.
Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, said Medicaid covers nearly one-third of all births in Kansas and cares for nearly two-thirds of all nursing home residents statewide.
“Kansas hospitals rely on Medicaid reimbursement, which accounts for 15% of inpatient days on average,” she said. “Most Medicaid spending in Kansas supports the elderly and disabled, meaning cuts would impact those who need care the most.”
Reduced Medicaid funding translates to uninsured Kansans, which Samuelson said would drive up costs of uncompensated care, which shifts those costs to businesses and private insurance payers. Sixty-seven percent of Kansas hospitals are operating in the red, she said.
In a nod to the impact Medicaid cuts would have on rural hospitals, the Senate included a $50 billion rural hospital fund in its bill, but that’s not enough, said David Jordan, president and CEO of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. In a research brief, Jordan’s organization said Kansas rural hospitals would receive about $811 million from that fund.
“It will not offset the billions of dollars that Kansas and Kansas hospitals lose from the bill,” he said. “As you know, Kansas has more financially vulnerable hospitals than any other state in the country and the average hospital in Kansas is operating with a -9.9% average. Our hospitals cannot afford to absorb billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts without cutting services and/or possibly closing their doors.”
 
No ‘common sense’
Statements about the spending bill flowed throughout the week, challenging House representatives to make changes, which didn’t happen.
“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, they just voted on a bill that, along with the tariffs, will make things even worse by stoking inflation and raising interest rates,” said Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, who is running for governor, after the Senate vote. “Nothing about this bill says ‘common sense,’ and everything about it says ‘extremism.’ ”
Julie Govert Walter, executive director of the North Central-Flint Hills Area Agency on Aging, last week listed seven concerns in a letter to the editor about the bill’s effects on older adults, caregivers and people with disabilities.
“These proposed large cuts to the Medicaid program will have a significant impact on our state’s ability to continue these essential (home and community-based) services over time,” she said. “You cannot bleed a system this significantly and expect all of it to remain healthy.”
Among the seven issues she addressed was expected closures of rural hospitals and clinics as a result of funding cuts to Medicaid. 
“Not having available health care will speed the economic deterioration of vulnerable Kansas communities and adversely affect the tax bases of counties and cities dependent on a stable population,” Govert Walter said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/protestersjuly22025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-03 15:10:25.957849

If voters oppose Republicans at the ballot box in return, it could mean the GOP loses the House during next year’s midterm elections.In the end just two Republicans in the House and three in the Senate opposed the measure, which the Senate approved earlier in the week with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.Trump posted on social media numerous times in the days leading up to the vote, thanking supportive Republicans who were praising the bill during interviews and threatening to back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who stood in the way of passage.“Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,” Trump posted just after midnight when it wasn’t yet clear the bill would pass. “What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”Johnson said during a floor speech the legislation is a direct result of the November elections, when voters gave the GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House.“That election was decisive. It was a bellwether. It was a time for choosing,” Johnson said. “And I tell you what — the American people chose, overwhelmingly, they chose the Republican Party.”

The package, he said, would make the country “stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”“We've had spirited debates, we've had months of deliberation and now we are finally ready to fulfill our promise to the American people,” Johnson said.Republicans were spurred to write the tax provisions in the legislation to avoid a cliff at the end of the year, created by the party’s 2017 tax law. But the legislation holds dozens of other provisions as well, spanning border security, defense, energy production, health care and higher education aid.The bill raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a staggering figure that many fiscal hawks would have once balked at, but is enough to get Republicans past the midterm elections before they’ll have to negotiate another deal to raise the country’s borrowing limit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s latest analysis of the measure projects it would add $3.4 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.Jeffries: “It guts Medicaid’House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the health care provisions “reckless” during a speech that lasted nearly nine hours, forcing the vote to take place in the afternoon rather than early morning, and said the “bill represents the largest cut to health care in American history.”

“Almost $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid,” Jeffries said. “This runs directly contrary to what President Trump indicated in January, which was that he was going to love and cherish Medicaid. Nothing about this bill loves and cherishes Medicaid. It guts Medicaid.”The speech broke the eight-hour-and-32-minute record that then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., set in 2021 when he sought to delay Democrats from passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. House leaders are allowed to exceed normal speaking limits through a privilege called the “magic minute.”The nonpartisan health research organization KFF’s analysis of the package shows it would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion during the next decade and lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured.Republicans made numerous changes to the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, including a requirement that some enrollees work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.Medicaid patients will no longer be able to have their care covered at Planned Parenthood for routine appointments, like annual physicals and cancer screenings, for one year. Congress has barred federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortions with limited exceptions for decades, but the new provision will block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, likely leading some of its clinics to close.Overnight dramaHouse passage followed several frenzied days on Capitol Hill as congressional leaders and Trump sought to sway holdouts to their side ahead of a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.The Senate, and then later the House, held overnight sessions followed by dramatic votes where several Republicans, who said publicly they didn’t actually like the bill, voted to approve it anyway. GOP leaders didn’t have much room for error amid a narrow 53-seat Senate majority and a 220-212 advantage in the House. That delicate balance hovered in the background during the last several months, as talks over dozens of policy changes and spending cuts in the bill appeared deadlocked.Any modifications meant to bring on board far-right members of the party had to be weighed against the policy goals of centrist lawmakers, who are most at risk of losing their seats during next year’s elections.The House passed its first version of the bill following a 215-214 vote in May, sending the legislation to the Senate, where Republicans in that chamber spent several weeks deciding which policies they could support and which they wanted to remove or rework.The measure changed substantially to comply with the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill through the upper chamber. GOP leaders chose to use that process, instead of moving the package through the regular legislative pathway, to avoid having to negotiate with Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.In the end nearly every one of the 273 Republicans in Congress approved the behemoth 870-page bill.Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Rand Paul and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis voted against it in the Senate and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie opposed passage in the House.Fitzpatrick wrote in a statement that while he voted to approve the House's original version of the bill, he couldn't support changes made in the Senate.""I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military.” Fitzpatrick wrote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.”Massie posted on social media that he couldn’t vote for the measure because it would exacerbate the country’s annual deficit.“Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,” Massie wrote. GOP holdouts delay passageFloor debate on the bill in the House, which began around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Thursday and lasted 11 hours, was along party lines, with Democrats voicing strong opposition to changes in the package and GOP lawmakers arguing it puts the country on a better path.GOP leaders didn’t originally plan to begin debate in the middle of the night while most of the country slept, but were forced to after holdouts refused to give their votes to a procedural step.When the House did finally adopt the rule, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick was the sole member of his party to vote against moving onto floor debate and a final passage vote.Fitzpatrick had posted on social media earlier in the day that he wanted Trump “to address my serious concern regarding reports the United States is withholding critical defense material pledged to Ukraine.”“Ukrainian forces are not only safeguarding their homeland—they are holding the front line of freedom itself,” he wrote. “There can be no half-measures in the defense of liberty. We must, as we always have, stand for peace through strength.”Tax breaks and so much moreHouse Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., made significant promises to middle-class Americans during floor debate about the tax provisions in the bill that many voters will be watching for in the months ahead. “Households making under $100,000 will see a 12% tax cut compared to what they pay today. The average family of four will see nearly 11,000 more in their pockets each year,” Smith said. “Real wages for workers will rise by as much as $7,200 a year. A waitress working for tips will keep an extra $1,300, a lineman working overtime after a storm will keep an extra $1,400.”Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, ranking member on the tax writing panel, said the legislation’s benefits skew largely toward the very wealthy.“If you made a million dollars last year, you're going to make a plus of $96,000 in the next tax filing season,” Neal said. “If you made under $50,000 last year, you're going to get 68 cents a day in terms of your tax relief.”The extension of the 2017 tax law would predominantly benefit high-income earners. The top 1% would receive a tax cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Some other tax incentives that critics say skew toward wealthier families include a $1,000 deposit from the federal government for babies born between 2024 and 2028, known as a “Trump account.” The program would track a stock index and gain interest accordingly and families with disposable income could contribute additional funding.And while Republicans included an extension of the child tax credit to $2,200 per child, it requires the parents to have a Social Security number to claim the tax credit.The bill will give the president more than $170 billion to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations of people in the country without permanent legal status. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Food aid, higher educationThe legislation will overhaul federal loans for higher education and how states pay for food assistance that roughly 42 million low-income people rely on, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The bill would cap federal graduate loans to $100,000 per borrower and $200,000 per borrower who is attending law school or medical school. It would also cap the ParentPLUS loans to $65,000.Under the SNAP changes, the package would require states to shoulder more of the burden in food assistance. Currently, the federal government covers 100% of the cost. The legislation tightens eligibility for SNAP, requiring parents with children aged 6 and older to meet the work requirements when they were previously exempt.The SNAP changes would reduce federal spending on the program by $230 billion over 10 years.The GOP megabill cuts clean energy tax credits and claws back some of the funding in former president Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.Some of those cuts to clean energy tax credits include terminating at the end of September a nearly $8,000 rebate for the purchase of an electric vehicle, ending a tax credit by December for energy efficient home upgrades such as solar roof panels and heat pumps.The package rescinds funds to help local governments and states adopt zero emission standards, and eliminates environmental justice block grants that communities used to address health impacts due to environmental pollution, among other things.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-03 16:10:47.138746

(Getty image)Rhode Island has joined at least eight other blue states that have taken steps against library censorship after Gov. Dan McKee signed the Freedom to Read Act into law Wednesday.
The legislation introduced by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, and Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, protects libraries and their patrons from book-banning efforts and affirms the free speech rights of authors, publishers and readers in the state.
“We can decide what books we want to check out from the library, and we can decide what our own children read or don’t read. But what we can’t do is decide what everyone else gets to read or what other people’s children get to read or not read,” McKenney said in a statement. “Reading is a gift, and it is so important that we stay protective of the gift of reading and that when someone wants to take it away, whether by banning books directly or by launching lawsuits attempting to intimidate libraries, schools and librarians because of a book they have on their shelves, we fight.”
Connecticut, Oregon, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington have all passed laws in the past two years protecting access to reading materials on racial and sexual themes, including the LGBTQ+ issues. The push has come in response to efforts by conservative groups to ban books in school libraries across the country, as well as laws enacted in some red states that threaten criminal penalties against librarians.
“The passage of the Freedom to Read Act is a powerful victory for democracy, education, and the fundamental right to access knowledge,” Morales said. “After years of advocacy from librarians, educators, parents, students and community leaders, we’ve made it clear that no one should be able to censor books or intimidate those who share them. This law protects the freedom to explore, learn and grow. Most of all, this ensures our libraries remain inclusive spaces for all.”
The American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom in 2024 recorded 821 attempts across the country to censor library books and materials, down from 1,247 attempts reported in 2023, but still the third-highest number of book challenges.
Under Rhode Island’s new law, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, in collaboration with the chief of library services, is responsible for developing policies for public and school libraries on standards for the selection and curation of library material, criteria for removing school library materials and protections against attempts to censor library material. 
Policies should support the freedom to read as a human right, encourage and protect the freedom of public libraries to acquire books and other materials without external limitations and ensure materials won’t be banned, removed, censored or have access to them restricted due to doctrinal or partisan disapproval.
The law allows any librarian subjected to discipline, termination or threats of discipline or termination for refusing to censor library materials in violation of policies established according to this legislation, to seek injunctive relief in court.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S.District Court in Greenbelt in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order,”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.
The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

Judges in New York and Pennsylvania disagree. Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide. (Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether NJ Transit can be held responsible for accidents or if it has sovereign immunity from lawsuits as an arm of the state.
The nation’s top court agreed Thursday to hear arguments on two conflicting state rulings over NJ Transit’s liability in bus crashes that left two men injured.
In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court determined the transit agency is an arm of the state and consequently dismissed a lawsuit filed by Cedric Galette, who was a passenger in a car that collided with a NJ Transit bus in August 2018 in Philadelphia.
In New York, courts came to the opposite conclusion and found the agency operates independently from the state, so allowed a lawsuit over a Manhattan collision to proceed. In that case, Jeffrey Colt was injured after a NJ Transit bus hit him in February 2017.
A spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin declined to comment Thursday, and an NJ Transit spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
But Platkin filed a brief in April welcoming the U.S. Supreme Court’s review, calling the conflicting rulings an “untenable split in which New Jersey finds itself.”
“When an NJ Transit train leaves Morrisville, Pennsylvania, bound for New York City, its sovereign immunity toggles on and off at different points along the route,” Platkin’s brief says. “If NJ Transit is sued for conduct in Morrisville, in Pennsylvania state court, it enjoys sovereign immunity. But if NJ Transit faces suit for the same conduct in New York City, in New York state court, its sovereign status suddenly evaporates. Same public service, same day, same train — yet a different answer on the same state entity’s immunity.”
A ruling promises to have a huge financial impact on the state, whichever way it goes.
Public transit typically fuels the most lawsuits against the state, with officials paying out millions every year to resolve them.
Lawsuits have been filed on behalf of passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists injured or killed in bus and rail accidents, as well as workers hurt, harassed, or discriminated against on the job.
Some have resulted in seven-figure payouts, or more.
The state paid $10 million in 2022 to end a lawsuit filed by Xuefang Zhong, a bus passenger who was retrieving her luggage from an under-carriage compartment when the bus drove away and dragged her with it in New York City. She was injured so severely she needed a leg amputation and multiple surgeries. The family of Siham Hajbi got almost $1.8 million in 2023 to settle a wrongful death lawsuit they filed after a NJ Transit bus turned a corner and hit Hajbi as she walked in a Haledon crosswalk.
Lawsuit payouts in 2021 included $2 million to a pedestrian, Kiliek Anthony, who suffered a traumatic brain injury after he was hit by a NJ Transit bus in December 2015 in Irvington, and $7.4 million in three separate settlements to people injured when an empty NJ Transit bus ran a red light in August 2016 and collided with another NJ Transit bus in Newark, killing the bus driver and a passenger and injuring a dozen other passengers.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Over the last five years, while local jails in the United States have been holding fewer people, New Mexico’s largest jail has been detaining nearly one-third more people while they await their day in court.
That’s according to a recent study of the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), located just outside Albuquerque in Bernalillo County.
Even though MDC hasn’t been as crowded in the last 10 years as it was historically, it’s been slowly holding more and more people, said Paul Guerin, director of the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico Institute for Social Research, which has studied the jail’s population since the 1990s.
Between 2019 and 2024, jail populations in the U.S. decreased by 15.3%, while the MDC’s population has grown by 30.3%, the report states.
Police-reported crime peaked in the U.S. in the 1990s and has generally decreased since, according to the report. While trends in police-reported crime in New Mexico, Bernalillo County and Albuquerque have always exceeded national trends, they have also gone down overall, the report states.
Over the last 10 years, local and state policymakers have affected how many people are booked into MDC and how long they stay there, according to the report. State policies and laws that have reduced these figures include voters’ approval of bail reform in 2016; the state Supreme Court’s case management order in 2015; and the statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020 that slowed the spread of COVID-19, according to the report.
On the other hand, policies that have packed more people into the jail have included New Mexico State Police “surges” in Bernalillo County in 2019 and 2021, and NMSP’s “North Star” operations with the Albuquerque Police Department, the report states.
Local prosecutors seek lawmakers’ help in lifting court deadlines

On any given day last October, MDC held an average of 1,803 people, the highest figure since December 2014, the report states.
While the MDC was designed to hold as many as 2,236 people, it’s not allowed to exceed a cap of 1,950 people under a 2017 settlement agreement between the City of Albuquerque and people incarcerated in the jail who sued more than two decades earlier.
However, the report states that MDC “is closer to the McClendon Cap than ever in the last eight years.”
Guerin told Source NM in an interview that authorities are holding more people in MDC because they’re booking more people into the jail, and holding them there for longer periods of time under more serious charges.
Guerin said people in MDC should primarily be there under lower-level charges because those who are charged with more serious crimes are out of their communities for longer periods of time, so they have fewer chances of returning to jail.
In a given year, approximately 40% of the people held in MDC are there two or more times under less serious charges, the report states.
“The jail is consistently receiving people who are cycling in and out of jail,” Guerin said.
A prior report on pretrial detention found that more than 40% of people who are held in jail while facing felony charges stay in the jail for 120 days on average, only to have their cases dismissed, Guerin said.
The problem, Guerin said, is that these are people the system believes are the most serious offenders, and more than 40% of them don’t receive a conviction, for various reasons, good and bad.
This results in not only wasted money holding people in MDC, but also social costs like people being away from their families and losing their jobs, Guerin said.
The report suggests that policymakers consider whether people in MDC should be there or not.
“We should be more efficient in prosecuting cases if we think they’re guilty,” Guerin said. “I don’t know why we don’t.”
Guerin and co-author Senior Research Scientist Elise Ferguson published the report in June, and it has received disappointingly few reactions, he said.
“We and others who produce information that’s useful for policymakers, often that information is not used,” he said.
Guerin said he thinks what is driving policy instead are people’s impressions, anecdotal stories, politics and sensationalized media coverage.
“Information should drive policy,” he said. “My hope is that information would just inform policy, but I don’t even think we see that oftentimes.”

Steve Erdman of Bayard leads a news conference at the Nebraska State Capitol on his EPIC Option tax proposals at the Nebraska State Capitol. May 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The petition campaign to eliminate Nebraska taxes on property, income, inheritances and corporations is returning for the 2026 election, hoping to capitalize on recent legislative failures and rising property valuations.
The “EPIC Option” group is back with what supporters are calling “EPIC Option 2.0” to ban state or local governments from collecting property, income and inheritance taxes after Jan. 1, 2028. Rather than proposing a broad consumption tax as replacement revenue, the Legislature would need to come up with a fix on its own.
“It’s time for the people to be in control of this situation, and the only way we can do that is when the people vote,” former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, a spokesperson for the campaign, said this week.
The ballot measure would add to the Nebraska Constitution: “No governmental entity in the state of Nebraska shall collect property tax, income tax or inheritance tax beginning January 1, 2028.”
In the hands of the people
Erdman said the EPIC team had been considering what to do after falling short of securing the necessary signatures to reach the ballot in 2024.

There were hopes the Legislature or Gov. Jim Pillen could do more than “incremental changes” for property tax relief, said Erdman, who was term-limited in January after eight years. But he said the 2024 special session dedicated to property taxes retroactively raised taxes because of the so-called “missing year” of income tax credits for property taxes paid. Then, lawmakers failed again in 2025. Erdman tried many times to legislatively pass the EPIC Option.
“Even when we try to do incremental changes, sometimes it winds up coming and biting us in the butt,” Erdman said.
State Sens. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area are continuing work on their own constitutional amendment to tackle rising property taxes and valuations. Kauth’s Legislative Resolution 12CA stalled in the Legislature’s Revenue Committee this spring.
Erdman said he and others can’t think of any other option than EPIC and that voters have reached a similar “tipping point” as in 1966. That’s when the Legislature sought to create and use state income and sales taxes to lower state property taxes. In response, voters in 1966 also successfully led a campaign to abolish state property taxes.
“I have spoken with people who circulated that petition in ‘66 and asked what their plan was to replace the revenue. And they said the outcry of how high taxes were, there was no plan,” Erdman said. “They said, ‘We are tired of paying these taxes.’”
‘The revolt is becoming more sustained’
Sixty years later, the EPIC approach would be slightly different, providing approximately a one-year window for the state to find a solution if EPIC is advanced to and passed on the ballot.

The 2024 EPIC Option team faced resistance from a counter movement named “No New Taxes Nebraska,” an organization that included former State Sens. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha and Dan Hughes of Venango, former colleagues of Erdman, as well as the League of Nebraska Municipalities, Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, Nebraska Hospital Association, Nebraska Realtors and Nebraska Health Care Association.
The EPIC Option ballot question committee has raised about $175,000 and spent $140,000 since 2023, according to filings with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission.
The No New Taxes group, formed in February 2024, raised and spent $58,165 last year. The group filed in February to dissolve its committee with the NADC.
Erdman said his group was continually “chastised” for pushing a consumption tax plan, criticisms he says were incorrect, so advocates are now looking to force the Legislature to act.
“The revolt is becoming more sustained and longer and, right now, because the valuation hearings protests are going on at the local courthouse, these people are fired up,” Erdman said. “And rightfully so, because this Legislature, nor any since 1967, has not had the intestinal fortitude to make changes to a broken system to make it fair for the taxpayer.”
The campaign would need valid signatures from 10% of Nebraska voters, including from 5% of voters in at least 38 of the state’s 93 counties, by July 2026 to reach the November 2026 ballot.

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Bad blood between Windsor Park residents, whose homes have been sinking for 35 years, and North Las Vegas, the city that residents say has turned a blind eye to their plight, surfaced Wednesday as the City Council approved a zoning change that will allow the neighborhood to relocate to homes built on solid ground.
State Sen. Dina Neal, the driving force behind the effort to relocate some 93 families from Windsor Park, called out the North Las Vegas City Council for its inaction on behalf of their constituents and for its alleged attempts to discredit her.
“I want to thank you for every low down action you took, because I found deeper courage to stand up for what I believe in and continue to fight for these families,” Neal said during public comment. “I want to thank the city for fighting with me because you enlarged my capacity. I want to thank you for lying on me because you increased my faith. I want to thank you for using your city emails last year to talk about how you were going to conspire, collude and plan against me during my campaign. I thank you because it made me believe deeper in my purpose.”
 History seeped in neglect

Windsor Park, built during the segregation era of the 1960s as a premier neighborhood primarily for Black residents, is today a patchwork of vacant lots and dilapidated structures. Its residents pay taxes, but don’t enjoy the benefits afforded others in North Las Vegas. Street lights are in disrepair. Stop signs are faded. Weeds grow through the cracked sidewalks.

More than half of the homes in the neighborhood, which was built on a depleting aquifer, have been demolished in the decades since the earth beneath them began to crumble. 
In 1994, North Las Vegas received $14.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to relocate homeowners. About half, including some who spent decades paying off mortgages, took the city up on the relocation offer, and got $50,000 for their trouble.     
But in recent years, the city has used federal money to attract new buyers, who were unaware they were purchasing worthless properties.  
Laquanna Sonnier, a single mother of three, obtained down payment assistance from the city to purchase her Windsor Park home in 2021 for $230,000. She didn’t know the home, which she thought was merely a fixer upper, was sinking until she was contacted by the Nevada Current in 2023.
Sonnier was shocked to learn the city, since 1991, has prohibited Windsor Park homeowners from remodeling or adding on to their properties, yet took no action to notify potential buyers or lenders of the subsidence. 
“I felt like my world was falling apart, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to even fix things around my house that needed to be fixed, especially with young children,” Sonnier, accompanied by her children, told the council.
“Explain to me how I was able to buy this home that’s sinking in 2019, when it’s been going on for how long?” homeowner Eli Valdez asked the council. 
“I can’t explain, nor will I try to explain why you all had to live in houses like that, whether it be in North Las Vegas or anywhere else. I think it’s abominable,” Councilman Richard Cherchio said, adding “nothing compares to what you had to endure all of these years. I could say for myself, I apologize for that as a council member now.”
Councilman Isaac Barron attempted to minimize the city’s role in Windsor Park’s tortured history, casting the city as a bit player.
“The state has taken the project out of the hands of the City of North Las Vegas. Is that not correct?” he asked city management, referring to state legislation sponsored by Neal in 2023 to relocate the residents en masse to a new neighborhood. The effort relies on $25 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, and a $12 million contribution from the state.
 Shaky ground

Had North Las Vegas forced residents from their homes it would have been on the hook for eminent domain awards, likely resulting in residents receiving higher than market value for their properties. Instead, homeowners allege, the city has engaged in a sort of reverse condemnation, by neglecting the neighborhood.
In 2019, Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown, then a councilwoman representing the ward that includes Windsor Park, claimed ignorance during a council meeting when asked by a resident why the city has failed to maintain the neighborhood for decades. 
“That’s a good question,” Goynes-Brown said at the time. “The last thing I want to do is not take care of Windsor Park. That is a priority. It also takes a partnership.” 
Without the ability to make improvements, residents say they’ve done the best they could.    
Windsor Park resident Pamela Neal (no relation to the state senator) said during public comment Wednesday that Goynes-Brown “knows the story as well as anyone” but failed to assist her constituents.
“Ms. Goynes, thank you. Finally,” Pamela Neal said after the first of two votes Wednesday to amend zoning to make way for a new Windsor Park to be constructed at Carey and West streets.
“It’s Ms. Goynes-Brown,” the mayor retorted.
Goynes-Brown, who once championed building warehouses that would have blocked the neighborhood’s one redeeming characteristic – its view of the Las Vegas valley — has frustrated residents and state Sen. Neal. 
“Senator Neal brought us hope,” Sonnier told the council.  
In 2023, Neal fought to pass state legislation to bail out the forgotten homeowners. When Gov. Joe Lombardo intended to veto the bill, Neal resurrected it.
The state’s selection of Frank Hawkins, a former Oakland Raider and former Las Vegas City Councilman, as the project’s developer, prompted allegations of cronyism directed at Neal. 
Hawkins told the council he didn’t want to “belabor the point,” but noted the Nevada Housing Division issued a request for proposal for the project.
“We responded, and we were successful in winning,” he said. “I’m a proud product of North Las Vegas, and I was raised in Windsor Park, so I have a commitment to do all I can to help make that project successful.” 
Leslie Vega of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada told the council their vote “is a chance to shift the moral compass of North Las Vegas and show that North Las Vegas is ready to correct a historical wrong.”

Barbara Carter, who has lived in Windsor Park since 1965, hopes she and her neighbors “can see the homes starting to be built before we die and leave this world, because this is a long time, and it should not have taken these many years…”
Sonnier says the likelihood of moving her children into a new, safe home is sinking in, though she has at times feared the effort would fall apart. 
“I knew it was important for my children to be here today to see this because they play in these streets that are cracked and damaged, sidewalks that are torn apart, and for them to know that they’re going to be in a safer environment,” Sonnier told the council. 
State Sen. Neal says the vote brings the residents closer to the end of the long and winding road they’ve been on for more than 30 years, adding its especially meaningful coming on the eve of the nation’s birthday. 
“This action will help them create generational wealth for their children and their grandchildren,” she said. “Why was America even created in the first place? It was to give opportunity. It was supposed to be a place where people could build their dreams.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/8F725BB1-DBC6-497D-BF4C-2B2DAA10B5E2-scaled-e1751564879525-1024x784.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 14:12:20.685040

Whether sipped from dainty cups, pinkies out accompanied with giggles; or whispered secrets or on hot, sunny days over ice, lazing on a front porch; or as spiritual satisfaction after an elaborate ceremony steeped in tradition, tea offers a quiet revelation.

“When I decided to start the business, I went to a tea conference to learn all that I could. At first, drinking tea out of my cup was just something that I did daily.

(Courtesy of Idahoans United for Women and Families)The rallying calls were familiar.
Despite dangerous pregnancy complications, women are being denied emergency abortions. Doctors are leaving the state. And politicians shouldn’t be involved in sensitive health decisions.
But one part of the pitch was new: Instead of asking state lawmakers for a fix, Idahoans can sign on to establish their own state law.
“Idaho has been living under the trigger ban for nearly three years,” Melanie Folwell, lead organizer for the group behind Idaho’s abortion rights ballot initiative, told a Boise rally on Saturday. “And we have seen — and you’ll see in the stories you hear today — that it simply does not work for Idaho. It doesn’t work for anybody. So, today is the first step we are taking to end the ban.”
The effort to collect signatures for the proposed ballot initiative comes nearly three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That reversal lifted federal court protections for abortions, letting states regulate abortion — which activated trigger abortion bans in several states, including Idaho.
Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws.
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote.
But qualifying an initiative for the ballot is a tough hurdle in Idaho.
In the past decade, only three ballot initiatives have had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot: a successful Medicaid expansion initiative in 2018, a failed historical horse racing initiative in 2018, and an unsuccessful primary election reform initiative in 2024.
The group Folwell leads, Idahoans United for Women and Families, is hoping to qualify the abortion ballot initiative for the ballot in the November 2026 general election. That gives organizers about a year to collect the nearly 71,000 signatures needed.
They already collected 1,200 signatures on Saturday, when hundreds of people turned out for the rally, organizers say. And organizers are gearing up for signature collection efforts across the state soon, Folwell told the Sun, helped by their 1,000 volunteers.
 Initiative could mean doctors won’t ‘be afraid to move to Idaho,’ doctor says

The initiative could mean doctors and other medical professionals “will not be afraid to move to Idaho and take care of us,” Dr. Becky Uranga, an Idaho doctor, said at the rally.
That could mean several things might get better, she explained between cheers from the audience — like your longtime doctor “will stay and keep caring for you and thousands of others,” that you may be able to avoid a six-month wait to see a doctor or other medical professional, and that Idaho doctors can “again provide the needed care without the risk of criminalization hanging over our heads.”
“And most of all, this could restore the sacred space between doctors and our patients. And I can honor all of your beliefs and privacy in the exam room — without any external pressures,” Uranga said.
Kate Campbell-Covell, a pregnant mother with two kids, told the rally about how she had to travel to Utah after she learned her son wouldn’t survive her pregnancy.
“With tears in their eyes, our extremely compassionate and loving medical team explained that due to the laws in Idaho, they were unable to render the care they deem necessary to save my life and protect my future fertility,” she said.
Then she was airlifted out of state, she said.
After federal court protections, St. Luke’s has said the health system hasn’t had to air transport any patients for pregnancy complications. Before those protections, St. Luke’s transported six patients out of state in the first four months of 2024. The federal court protections only allow emergency abortions for doctors at St. Luke’s.
Campbell-Covell later learned that she had a severe placenta infection. If left untreated, she would have died, she said.
She had her son’s ashes sent home.

 Ballot initiative backers explain why they signed

Krista Doubleday signed the initiative Saturday. She says she thinks people need to understand more about how an unwanted pregnancy affects people.
For years, she worked in social work, and now works as a local therapist.
“The amount of children that I saw living in absolutely horrid conditions, and from individuals that were forced to bear them from other countries, is really what radicalized me and made me pro choice,” Doubleday said.
Ken Harris, a local musician, also signed. He said he wants abortion access in Idaho to return to how it used to be.
“That was what the case was in Idaho for 50 years. Male politicians — politicians have no business dictating to people about their private medical decisions and feelings,” Harris told the Sun. “A woman’s opinion about what she should do with her body — for her own health, for her family — should be her decision alone.”
 Signature gathering starts — after delay from redrafting state’s official descriptions

To qualify for the ballot, the group needs at least 70,725 qualifying signatures from Idaho registered voters. That figure is 6% of Idaho’s nearly 1.2 million registered voters in the 2024 general election — spread across half of the state’s 35 legislative districts.
But signature gathering efforts were delayed by almost six months after initiative organizers legally challenged descriptions state officials developed about the initiative for voters to see, Folwell told the Sun. The descriptions are featured on signature gathering forms.
Last month, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and the Idaho Division of Financial Management to redraft the descriptions.
The new short ballot title describes the initiative as a “measure creating right to abortion before fetus viability, and post-viability to protect health; right to privacy; healthcare provider liability protections.”
The initiative would raise state expenses by less than one thousandth of a percent of Idaho’s share of the Medicaid budget, or between $3,100 and $7,800 each year, the initiative’s redrafted fiscal impact statement says.
“This impact is derived from the costs of treating chemical abortion complications for women enrolled in Idaho’s Medicaid program,” the fiscal impact statement says. “Medicaid covers medically necessary services to treat complications from all abortions. It is anticipated that as legal abortions increase, the complications will also increase. This will likely result in an increase in Medicaid covered services and expenditures to treat complications from chemical abortions, which the State has reliable and readily available data to support.”
The new fiscal impact statement also no longer includes the entire Medicaid services budget of $850 million in fiscal year 2024.

(Photo provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education)OKLAHOMA CITY — Those who knew Melissa Evon the best “laughed really hard” at the thought of her teaching family and consumer sciences, formerly known as home economics.
By her own admission, the Elgin High School teacher is not the best cook. Her first attempt to sew ended with a broken sewing machine and her mother declaring, “You can buy your clothes from now on.”
Still, Evon’s work in family and consumer sciences won her the 2025 Oklahoma Teacher of the Year award on Friday. Yes, her students practice cooking and sewing, but they also learn how to open a bank account, file taxes, apply for scholarships, register to vote and change a tire — lessons she said “get kids ready to be adults.”
“Even though most of my career was (teaching) history, government and geography, the opportunity to teach those real life skills has just been a phenomenal experience,” Evon told Oklahoma Voice. 
After graduating from Mustang High School and Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Evon started her teaching career in 1992 at Elgin Public Schools just north of Lawton. She’s now entering her 27th year in education, a career that included stints in other states while her husband served in the Air Force and a break after her son was born.
No matter the state, the grade level or the subject, “I’m convinced I teach the world’s greatest kids,” she said.
Her family later returned to Oklahoma where Evon said she received a great education in public schools and was confident her son would, too. 
Over the course of her career, before and after leaving the state, she won Elgin Teacher of the Year three times, district Superintendent Nathaniel Meraz said.
So, Meraz said he was “ecstatic” but not shocked that Evon won the award at the state level.
“There would be nobody better than her,” Meraz said. “They may be as good as her. They may be up there with her. But she is in that company of the top teachers.”

Like all winners of Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, Evon will spend a year out of the classroom to travel the state as an ambassador of the teaching profession. She said her focus will be encouraging teachers to stay in education at a time when Oklahoma struggles to keep experienced educators in the classroom.
Evon herself at times questioned whether to continue teaching, she said. In those moments, she drew upon mantras that are now the core of her Teacher of the Year platform: “See the light” by looking for the good in every day and “be the light for your kids.”
She also told herself to “get out of the boat,” another way of saying “take a leap of faith.” 
Two years ago, she realized she needed a change if she were to stay in education. She wanted to return to the high-school level after years of teaching seventh-grade social studies.
The only opening at the high school, though, was family and consumer sciences. Accepting the job was a “get out of the boat and take a leap of faith moment,” she said.
“I think teachers have to be willing to do that when we get stuck,” Evon said. “Get out of the boat. Sometimes that’s changing your curriculum. Sometimes it might be more like what I did, changing what you teach. Maybe it’s changing grade levels, changing subjects, changing something you’ve always done, tweaking that idea.”
Since then, she’s taught classes focused on interpersonal communication, parenting, financial literacy and career opportunities. She said her students are preparing to become adults, lead families and grow into productive citizens.
And, sure, they learn cooking and sewing along the way.
“I’m getting to teach those things, and I know that what I do matters,” Evon said. “They come back and tell me that.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 17:23:10+00:00,CT Mirror,"Trump administration withholds over $6 billion for after-school, summer programs and more",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/trump-administration-school-summer-program-funding/,A Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.
The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump’s priorities.
The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when — or if — they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.
Without the money, schools say they won’t be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.
For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn’t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.
After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. “If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,” Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.
Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that “decisions have not yet been made” on grants for the upcoming school year.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.
The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.
After-school child care at risk
In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they’ll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren’t released. There’s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.
Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district’s after-school programs may lose their jobs.
“Those hours between after school and 6 o’clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,” Browning said. “It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.”
Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.
Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump’s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.
“Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they’ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,” Murray said in a statement.
What the money funds
The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It’s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.
Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.
These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has at least $800 million in limbo, while Texas has more than $660 million.
“Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,” said Tony Thurmond, California’s state superintendent, in a statement. “The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump’s political ideology.
The loss of funds could “put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,” said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they’d receive the money, Reykdal said.
If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.
“They’re trying to send a message,” said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “They don’t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.”
Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon — with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English — relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she’ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district’s students.
“It’s an essential service in our community because we don’t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,” she said.
Sipe said it’s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.
“It feels preventable,” she said, “and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America’s children.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25182731277420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 14:12:20.685040

The ban was challenged by Becky Pepper-Jackson (pictured) a teenage transgender student athlete from West Virginia. (Billy Wolfe | ACLU photo)The Supreme Court of the United States will take up a challenge of a West Virginia law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in school sports in a case that could decide the legality of other such bans around the country.
The high court is expected to hear West Virginia vs. B.P.J. during its fall term.
The lawsuit was brought by the mother of Bridgeport student athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson against the West Virginia Board of Education. At the time the federal lawsuit was filed in 2021 Pepper-Jackson was an 11-year-old student athlete who wanted to run for her middle school’s cross-country team but was prohibited from doing so.
The lawsuit alleges the state’s 2021 Save Women’s Sports Act, signed by former Gov. Jim Justice, is unconstitutional.
In a ruling last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state from enforcing the ban, finding the law violated Pepper-Jackson’s rights. Pepper-Jackson, a freshman during the last school year, qualified to participate in two events during the West Virginia High School State Track & Field Championships in May, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews.
Since 2020, 27 states, including North Carolina, have banned transgender youth from playing school sports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court will also take up a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
State attorney general J.B. McCuskey celebrated the news that the high court would take up the case, saying that “female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard.”
“The people of West Virginia know that it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Pepper-Jackson is represented by the ACLU, Lambda Legal and Cooley LLP.
In a statement, Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, said that school athletic programs should be accessible to everyone regardless of sex and transgender status.
“Trans kids play sports for the same reasons their peers do — to learn perseverance, dedication, teamwork and to simply have fun with their friends,” he said. “Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”
In a statement Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who represented the state in the case in his prior role as attorney general, said he is pleased to hear the high court will take up the case.
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.

Idaho in 2020 became the first state in the nation to implement this kind of ban, which prohibits transgender athletes from participating on any team designated for women or girls, from public K-12 schools to universities. Similar laws are in place in 27 states. 
The ACLU of Idaho and the national American Civil Liberties Union challenged Idaho’s law immediately, arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment — which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. The West Virigina case additionally challenges the other law based on Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs.

Federal courts initially blocked Idaho’s law from taking effect. But the block was later narrowed to only protect the suing athlete, Linsday Hecox. That came after the U.S. Supreme Court, in another Idaho case called Poe v. Labrador, narrowed the scope of preliminary injunctions. 
“We are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will agree with federal court rulings that this ban is unconstitutional.” ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León said in an emailed statement. “Despite this ruling, Idaho remains an incredibly hostile state for transgender people, despite a national trans athlete ban failing to pass Congress earlier this year. Idaho will be on the wrong side of history on this issue, and transgender people are the ones paying the price for it.”

Last week, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador urged the U.S. Supreme Court to take up Idaho’s case, called Hecox v. Little, Idaho Education News reported. 
In a statement Thursday, Labrador said he was thrilled that the Supreme Court would hear Idaho’s case. 
“For too long, activists have worked to sideline women and girls in their own sports,” Labrador said. “Men and women are biologically different, and we hope the Court will allow states to end this injustice and ensure that men no longer create a dangerous, unfair environment for women to showcase their incredible talent and pursue the equal opportunities they deserve.”
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee state law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. Idaho has a similar state law. 
The case will be argued in the fall and decided in 2026, ABC News reported.

(Photo by Jean-Luc Ichard | Getty Images Plus)Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, the multi-national corporation widely blamed for contaminating southern New Hampshire’s air and water with dangerous levels of PFAS chemicals, has finished demolishing the Merrimack manufacturing facility at the center of the controversy, the company announced Thursday.
The state of New Hampshire has long blamed the plastics manufacturer with contaminating the air and water in Merrimack, Londonderry, Bedford, Litchfield and Hudson. In 2016, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, were discovered in hundreds of wells in the area surrounding the company’s Merrimack facility and many more have been discovered in the years since. 
Saint-Gobain did not admit to wrong-doing but in 2022, the company agreed in court as part of a consent decree to provide clean drinking water to approximately 1,000 homes whose water was contaminated. The following year, it announced it was closing the facility, which had been operating since 1986, ostensibly as part of a corporate restructuring across the company’s North American operations.
“Over the course of the past 18 months, the company has been working to diligently and responsibly wind down operations at the facility in Merrimack and complete the facility demolition in line with our decommissioning and demolition plan,” Saint-Gobain said in its statement. “The demolition process is now complete. We have coordinated closely with state and local authorities and regulators throughout this process and will continue to fulfill our remediation commitments in the region.”
PFAS chemicals, often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are so hard to break down, have been linked to cancer risk, reproductive complications and other health issues. The state Department of Health and Human Services found elevated rates of kidney cancer in Merrimack from 2009 to 2018, according to a 2023 report. Further analysis found that kidney cancer rates were rising in Merrimack and across New Hampshire while those rates remained stable across the rest of the U.S. DHHS wrote there was “a statistically significant, albeit modest excess of cases of kidney cancer in Merrimack.”
A class action lawsuit against the company brought by a group of New Hampshire residents is ongoing.

(Hadley Barndollar | New Hampshire Bulletin)For the second year in a row, a bill aimed at helping people wrongfully convicted of a crime get out of prison didn’t become law in New Hampshire, but advocates of the proposal say they’re not giving up.
“It’s incredibly frustrating to see this bill stall in the legislature for another year,” Winnie Ye, a state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, said. “This is an issue that is ultimately about liberty at the end of the day.”
The Innocence Project provides pro bono legal services, forensic testing, and investigative work to people believed to be wrongfully incarcerated.
Currently, under state law, people convicted of a crime have three years to request a new trial. This applies even if new evidence of their innocence emerges after that time period.
Cynthia Mousseau, staff attorney at the New England Innocence Project — a similar but independent regional organization — said in a release that it takes, on average, 11 years to uncover and correct a wrongful conviction. This, she said, makes the three-year deadline “particularly troubling.”
Senate Bill 141, sponsored by Sandown Republican Sen. Bill Gannon, would’ve eliminated that three-year deadline for cases in which new evidence emerges.
Ye described the bill as a “common sense fix” to a barrier for the wrongfully convicted.
“It was narrowly tailored,” she said. “It really was about giving people an opportunity to just file a petition if they had discovered evidence of their innocence. The courts would still have to review their positions, it would still go through that process, but this was really just about getting in the door and cracking the door open for innocent Granite Staters.”
Gannon’s bill sailed through the Senate with bipartisan support before being considered by the House. In the House, the bill was amended to add unrelated provisions that would expand confidentiality requirements for New Hampshire public libraries and their records. With that amendment, the House approved the bill in a 343-19 vote. However, when the bill returned to the Senate to consider the new provision, Senate negotiators killed the entire bill during a committee of conference.
Similar legislation last year actually made it to then Gov. Chris Sununu’s desk. But Sununu vetoed it, writing in his veto note that the “sentiment is sensible in the context of considering scientific and/or forensic breakthroughs, but the text of this legislation is problematic in that it is overly broad in allowing, if not inviting, an unending procession of frivolous petitions and appeals.” 
With the 2025 legislative session over, advocates say they plan to push for the legislation again when the Legislature reconvenes next year.
“Post-conviction mechanisms like this one are incredibly important to revealing wrongful convictions,” Ye said. “Without it, unfortunately, people will still be languishing behind bars.”
There have been 3,701 exonerations across the U.S. since 1989 as of Wednesday, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Only three of those have occurred in New Hampshire, according to the New England Innocence Project.
“This disparity isn’t because innocent people are not being wrongfully convicted in New Hampshire,” the organization wrote in a release, “but because outdated barriers in the law prevent them from proving their innocence.”

A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.

While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Getty Images)A new state report recommends stepped-up enforcement of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban, including financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and expanded oversight by senior health officials.
Much of the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) report, released Tuesday, emphasizes existing policies and requirements, like mandated abortion reporting and informed consent forms.
But several enforcement changes go further, including possible financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and formal escalation of abortion-related issues to top IDOH leadership.










Indiana is a state that supports Life, and the people’s representatives have enshrined those protections for the unborn into state law.


– Republican Gov. Mike Braun


In a letter published Wednesday, Gov. Mike Braun framed the effort as an extension of his broader “pro-life means pro-family” agenda. 
In January, he directed all state agencies to ensure Indiana’s abortion laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including mandatory cooperation on terminated‑pregnancy reporting, as well as a health department review of enforcement practices. Findings were due by July 1.
“Indiana is a state that supports Life, and the people’s representatives have enshrined those protections for the unborn into state law,” Braun wrote in his recent letter. “We are taking the necessary steps to make sure those laws are properly implemented.”
Internal, enforcement changes at IDOH
Under state law, abortion care providers must submit Terminated Pregnancy Reports (TPRs) to the IDOH after each abortion procedure. 
Providers must report within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information.
But State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver pointed to ongoing challenges with enforcement — namely two hospital systems, IU Health and Eskenazi Health, “that have refused to file TPRs.”

“This is a significant challenge for IDOH because it does not allow the agency to fully capture data regarding provision of abortions in Indiana and ensure appropriate compliance with Indiana’s laws,” Weaver wrote in the new report. 
The hospitals have based their refusal on a national reproductive health privacy rule, which was recently vacated by a federal judge in Texas.
Weaver said IDOH “is currently working with the hospitals and the Indiana Attorney General’s Office to resolve the dispute” over TPR filings.
To “address noncompliance swiftly and proportionately,” the health department has also started to develop new rules that would allow the agency to impose financial penalties on hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that fail to comply with abortion-related reporting laws, Weaver noted. It’s not yet clear how much those fines could be or when exactly they could be imposed.
Currently, enforcement primarily centers around punitive licensing actions or criminal referrals.
IDOH also pledged greater collaboration with other state agencies, including the Professional Licensing Agency (PLA) and the Department of Child Services (DCS), as well as new continuing education efforts to help providers better understand Indiana’s abortion statutes.
Weaver said collaboration with the Office of the Attorney General would include increased data sharing and more efficient communication around legal referrals. Joint efforts with PLA seek to address provider noncompliance through disciplinary action, and “strengthen(ed) communication” with DCS will especially focus on cases involving minors under the age of 16.
Ensuring “consistent and timely submission” of TPRs to DCS “will support child welfare investigations and ensure compliance with mandatory reporting laws,” Weaver wrote.
Abortions down statewide
Indiana Right to Life praised Braun’s actions, calling the new report “encouraging.”
“Hoosiers, in which so many want to love and support both moms and babies, will gain clarity on many issues from this report that underscores IDOH’s intent to work closely with other agencies, including the Office of the Attorney General, and to ensure Gov. Braun’s directive is carried out,” said Mike Fichter, the group’s president and CEO.
The release comes as Indiana marks its first full year under a near-total abortion ban enacted in 2022 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2023. An IDOH report released in May showed that just 146 abortions were reported statewide in 2024, down from thousands annually in prior years.
Despite the drop, Braun’s office said changes at IDOH and other state agencies are necessary to ensure “full compliance” and transparency post-Roe v. Wade.

Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday issued an executive order to Oregon’s 197 school districts, requiring they adopt a policy for banning student cellphone use by Oct. 31, 2025. Those policies must be fully implemented by Jan. 1, 2026, the order reads.
The move follows the Legislature’s failure to pass a similar, bipartisan bill — House Bill 2251 — during the recent legislative session.
That bill would have, with some exceptions, required districts to ban cellphones for all grades, and enforce penalties on students who violate cellphone policies. But it failed to clear a key Senate committee vote. It faced opposition from powerful school board and school administrator groups, which expressed concerns about the state mandating policies that they felt school districts themselves should handle. Some school district leaders testified that enforcing the ban would be prohibitively expensive for them to do.
But State Rep. Lisa Reynolds, D-Beaverton, a doctor and chief sponsor of the bill that failed to pass, said in a news release that she was glad Kotek stepped in.
“By getting cellphones out of our schools, Governor Kotek is putting students first,” she said. “Every Oregon student deserves a distraction-free, harassment-free learning environment that fosters curiosity and community.”
The order technically bans all “personal electronic devices,” which includes any portable, electrically powered device capable of making and receiving calls and text messages, and that can access the internet independently from the school’s wireless network, such as a smart watch. It does not include laptops or other devices that support classroom activities.
In November, the Oregon Department of Education issued guidance to districts on limiting or ending cellphone use in schools. State law currently requires every school district to have policies about cellphones and personal electronic devices, but each district gets to set its own rules.
At least eight Oregon school districts have already either banned use in individual classes or in schools altogether, according to the state education department. Full bans have been enacted at some middle and high schools in the Lincoln County School District, Portland Public Schools, and in the Nyssa School District. The Lake Oswego School District bans cellphones for students in all K-12 schools.
Kotek in a news release said that model policies for schools that already have prohibitions in place will be made available, and the state will offer some flexibility in implementation.
“The research is clear,” Korek said, “cellphone use can create a trifecta of consequences for our young people – mental health issues, safety in school, and distraction from learning.”
A growing body of research and teacher surveys show student cellphone use in schools is hindering more than helping the school experience.
In a May 2023 advisory, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy recommended parents set limits on phone use, and in June 2024, Murthy called for health warnings on social media platforms for younger users, who research shows are suffering from higher rates of mental health issues when spending hours on the platforms each day.
A Pew Research Center survey from October 2023 found that more than two-thirds of U.S. adults favor banning cellphones during class, and almost two-thirds of high school teachers said cellphones have become a major distraction and impediment to learning.
The order makes Oregon one of at least 19 states that have adopted statewide cellphone bans in schools.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)The federal government is disavowing responsibility for Florida’s Everglades immigration center the morning after people awaiting deportation arrived.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security neither funded nor authorized the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer detention center, counsel for the department wrote in a filing opposing environmental groups’ request that a federal court halt the site.
DHS also denied any authority over the immigrants, stating that Florida had decided to hold people at the detention center, rushed to completion in eight days.
Before Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that hundreds of immigrants would arrive Wednesday night, DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, told reporters the timing of the arrival of detainees was up to DHS. Griffin also said the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) was in charge of the detention center with oversight from the federal government.
DHS’ Thursday filings contrast what Kristi Noem, the department’s head, and the president have said about FEMA’s funding of the detention center, which is projected to cost the state $450 million to run annually.

“We took the FEMA money that Joe Biden allocated to pay for the free luxury hotel rooms where he’s paying hundreds of millions of dollars in New York City, and we used it to build this project,” President Donald Trump said Tuesday during his tour of the detention center at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport.
While in public, the Trump administration has touted the use of FEMA funds to reimburse Florida, its attempt to stave off the legal challenge to the Everglades site includes arguing that federal funding hasn’t and may never come. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against DHS, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), FDEM, and Miami-Dade County.
The environmental groups are challenging the legality of the detention center because it has not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law, and the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
“Florida has received no federal funds, nor has it applied for federal funds related to the temporary detention center,” counsel for DHS and ICE wrote. “Courts cannot adjudicate hypothetical future funding decisions or render advisory opinions on contingent scenarios that may never materialize.”
Another top ICE official described in a declaration to the court the agency’s role in the development of the detention center as limited to an inspection to ensure compliance and meeting with state officials to discuss operational matters.
The DeSantis administration relied on a January 2023 emergency declaration against illegal immigration to commandeer the land owned by Miami-Dade County. The governor and Uthmeier have described the detention center as “Alligator Alcatraz,” a “one-stop shop” for deportations, stating that the flights would be handled by the federal government.
Oversight visit from Dems
Democrats at the state and federal levels have called out the lack of transparency or answers about the operation of the detention center. State Democratic lawmakers (Sens. Shevrin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith and Reps. Anna Eskamani, Angie Nixon, and Michele Rayner) planned to visit the center on Thursday afternoon.
“As lawmakers, we have both the legal right and moral responsibility to inspect this site, demand answers, and expose this abuse before it becomes the national blueprint,” they wrote in a press release. “So much of this is also a distraction from the everyday issues all Floridians are facing, like housing affordability and the property insurance crisis. DeSantis should be focused on solving those issues, not creating even more chaos.”
Earlier in the week, FDEM Director Kevin Guthrie argued in a filing to the court that the detention center is necessary to alleviate overcrowding in ICE detention centers. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year, according to agency press releases. As of June 15, ICE held 56,397 people in detention, exceeding the 41,500 it has the funds to detain in the 2024 fiscal year.
Neither FDEM nor the governor’s office immediately responded to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

The photo was taken in Helena (Photo courtesy of Maria Pacheco).It began with a search for Anderson DeJesus Bastidas Linares, a man Immigrations and Customs Enforcement wanted for assaulting a family member with a weapon.
It ended with Christopher Martinez, a 31-year-old Helena man who authorities said looked a lot like Linares, in custody, pulled away from his wife and four children, facing deportation even though he’s lived in the country for years. 
Originally, Helena Police said that Martinez was being detained because he was an associate of Linares — a statement they’ve now walked back. 
Now, Martinez may face removal from Helena, Montana and America, because a law enforcement officer thought he looked like Linares, and his license plate was expired. 
Martinez first came to the United States as a minor in 2008. He’s attempted to attain citizenship since turning 18, a process his wife, Maria Pacheco, describes as “very difficult.” He’s been living in Helena with Pacheco and their four children since July 2022.
“We love Helena. He loves the cold,” said Pacheco. “We’d put on our winter coats and walk around the parks. We always go to the lakes in the summers, grill hot dogs and hamburgers, just let the kids run. We have fun.” 
On Monday, Martinez was stopped for speeding by Lewis and Clark County Patrol Division. He received a citation for driving without a license, a notice to appear in court, and was sent on his way. 
On Tuesday, while driving home during his lunch break, he was stopped again – this time by a combination of the U.S. Marshals Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and U.S. Border Patrol, with assistance from the Helena police.
“The long version is federal marshals and HP task force officers were hunting for a guy that had a felony warrant. During surveillance, they saw a male that essentially one of the federal agencies said, ‘Hey, this might be the guy. He matches a description. He’s getting in a red truck. He’s leaving,’” said Lt. Adam Shanks, of the Helena Police Department. “So they looked at the red truck. They ran the license plate. It came back as an expired license plate. That’s when they requested our assistance.” 
Shanks said that Helena Police may assist federal agents in tasks such as traffic control or peacekeeping, and their policy does not prevent them from cooperating with various federal agencies in specific circumstances. He emphasized the Helena Police Policy is open to the public. 
“Our officers were actually just going to give him citations and he was going to leave and cut him loose,” Shanks said. “They were then informed by the Border Patrol agents that happened to be along with the Federal Marshals that day that they were going to take custody of him because of his immigration status.” 
In their official press release, Helena Police confirmed the initial target was Anderson DeJesus Bastidas Linares. 
“Although the individual (Martinez) was determined not to be the primary suspect, he was believed to be an associate,” the press release said. 
The Helena Police no longer stand by that. 
“From what I understand and from what I’ve been told, it’s not clear enough to say that he was,” Shanks said.  
News of the arrest and ICE’s presence in Montana’s capitol city caused alarm and outrage.
The arrest lit up social media and soon it had blossomed into a full-scale panic as news the arrest translated into a belief that ICE was trying to transport Martinez out of state. From there, community members started planning a rally at the courthouse for Martinez’ release. 
The Lewis & Clark County Sheriff’s Office shared the post on their own Facebook page, labeling it “pure propaganda” and “false information.” 
“I stand by that,” said Sheriff Leo Dutton. “The reason I did that is I did not want a bunch of people trying to rush around security and causing a public safety issue.” 
Nearly 31 hours later, the original post was removed and a correction has been made. 
Regarding future cooperation with Border Control, Dutton confirmed that going forward, Lewis & Clark County would not be detaining anyone who doesn’t hold local charges.  The county does have some experience partnering with federal immigration agencies.
As the community sits on edge, Pachecho told the Daily Montanan that her husband loves Montana, loves his family and has tried for years to get through the cumbersome and confusing naturalization process.
With a short drive of only four minutes, Pacheco said Martinez comes home from work every chance he gets. 
“He doesn’t like to have lunch at work because he wants to spend time with us,” she said. “And he knows I always have a hot meal for him here.” 
“He has fun with me,” said 4-year old Aurora Martinez. “He watches movies with me.”

“We watch a lot of ‘Madagascar,’” explained Maria Pacheco, wife of Christopher Martinez and mother to their four children. “That song ‘Move It, Move It’ – every time we’re in the car, every time he comes home on lunch breaks, that’s the go-to song. All three of the little ones start dancing.” 
Even as Martinez was continuing citizenship paperwork, Pacheco was surprised how “quick and in the dark” his detention was. 
“They took my husband without any rights, with nothing,” she said. “They took him in a van that wasn’t even labeled. The people that took him were dressed in black, had no logo on their clothes either. He didn’t get a chance to talk, he didn’t get his right to have an attorney during the time he was held. The way they just stopped him because he looks similar to one of them, and just automatically sent him to ICE makes no sense to me.”
Martinez is being represented by Upper Seven Law and has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that challenges his detention as a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and asks the court to prevent him from being removed from Montana or the United States until his claims can be heard. 
“Mr. Martinez was arrested and detained by Helena police and federal authorities based on what appears to be racial profiling,” said Andres Haladay, an attorney with Upper Seven Law. “Consistent with normal court procedure and the federal Constitution, the Montana District Court ordered federal authorities not to transfer Mr. Martinez out of Montana while we challenge those actions.
“Shared racial or ethnic characteristics are not a reasonable basis for determining that someone has committed a crime or is in the United States unlawfully.” 
Haladay said even communicating with his client has been difficult. 
“We got notification that he was there,” said Haladay. “Lewis and Clark County was relatively unhelpful in not confirming his presence, confirming his presence, agreeing to let us speak with him and then preventing us from speaking with him. In all of that, another unmarked vehicle with Washington plates arrived and took him away from the detention center while we were still trying to secure access to him.” 
According to Lewis & Clark Sheriff Leo Dutton, mistakes were indeed made. 
“That’s the first time in 41 years that it’s ever happened,” said Dutton, regarding cooperation with Border Control. “My staff may or may not have done everything right. We just have never had this before.” 
A hearing for Mr. Martinez is scheduled for 1:30 p.m., July 10 at the Russell Smith Federal Court in Missoula. 
“We are zealously challenging an apparent unconstitutional exercise of federal power in our hometown,” said Haladay. “In Montana, we stand by our neighbors.”
For now, Haladay believes that Martinez will remain in Montana, based on an order from U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen, who will oversee the case.  
“I have received representations that they are honoring this order,” Haladay said. 
Pacheco is still awaiting news from her husband, and while she does, her focus remains on her children. 
“You know as a mother I try to look for solutions, and not having a solution is heartbreaking. I just tell them we’re going to go through this, we just pray to God that everything works out,” she said. 
A community fundraiser for the family has raised nearly $5,700 to help with additional costs. Pacheco expressed gratitude to those in the community. 
“I appreciate everything everyone is doing. Just to know that I have a lot of people who care is amazing,” she said. “I was so overwhelmed, you know, I have no solution. I heard a lot of people, when they’re detained, it takes like months for people to get to talk to them. I was really worried. I thank everybody in the community that is helping us.” 
Her children are thinking only of their father. 
“I care for my father very much. I want my baby brother to grow up with him the way me and my sisters did,” says 10-year old Lourdes, speaking of her 1-year old brother, Christopher Martinez, Jr. 
“He’s the best dad I could ever have,” says 6-year old Melody.

The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic.
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor.
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.
Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector.
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices.
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts in the Northeast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, about the same as last year, followed by the South where hosts can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87.

U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame.
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted.
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer.
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union.
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system.
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.

However, it’s unclear what part of the court order the state will contest. 
The three-member state Board of Election Commissioners on Thursday filed a court document declaring it intends to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court an order issued by a federal three-judge panel. 
A representative in Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office, which is filing the appeal on behalf of the state, said the appeal will not disrupt the upcoming elections. Fourteen legislative districts around the state are preparing to conduct the election based on the lower court ruling.
Fitch’s office has not yet filed a substantive briefing outlining what portion of the lower court’s order it intends to appeal. But an official within Fitch’s office said the appeal will only present a narrow legal issue to the nation’s highest court and not appeal the entire lower court order that required the state to conduct do-over elections this year.
Still, the appeal is notable because it comes in the middle of special elections that the lower court ordered the state to conduct to allow Black voters in Mississippi a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice. The party primaries are scheduled for August.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03124913/Voting-Tuesday-6.jpg,,,2025-07-03 13:16:56.727750

(Billy Wolfe | ACLU photo)The Supreme Court of the United States will take up a challenge of a West Virginia law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in school sports in a case that could decide the legality of other such bans around the country.
The high court is expected to hear West Virginia vs. B.P.J. during its fall term.
The lawsuit was brought by the mother of Bridgeport student athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson against the West Virginia Board of Education. At the time the federal lawsuit was filed in 2021 Pepper-Jackson was an 11-year-old student athlete who wanted to run for her middle school’s cross country team but was prohibited from doing so.
The lawsuit alleges the state’s 2021 Save Women’s Sports Act, signed by former Gov. Jim Justice, is unconstitutional.
In a ruling last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state from enforcing the ban, finding the law violated Pepper-Jackson’s rights. Pepper-Jackson, a freshman during the last school year, qualified to participate in two events during the West Virginia High School State Track & Field Championships in May, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews.
Since 2020, 27 states have banned transgender youth from playing school sports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court will also take up a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
State attorney general J.B. McCuskey celebrated the news that the high court would take up the case, saying that “female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard.”
“The people of West Virginia know that it’s unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that’s why we passed this commonsense law preserving women’s sports for women,” McCuskey said. “We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.”
Pepper-Jackson is represented by the ACLU, Lambda Legal and Cooley LLP.
In a statement, Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, said that school athletic programs should be accessible to everyone regardless of sex and transgender status.
“Trans kids play sports for the same reasons their peers do  — to learn perseverance, dedication, teamwork and to simply have fun with their friends,” he said. “Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”
In a statement Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who represented the state in the case in his prior role as attorney general, said he is pleased to hear the high court will take up the case.
“I am optimistic that after hearing the case, the Supreme Court will restore sanity to athletics and allow West Virginia to enforce its commonsense law that prevents boys from competing in girl’s sports,” Morrisey said.

A growing number of states have more older adults than children, making it likely there will be fewer young residents to care for their elders as their ranks continue to grow (Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline).Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates released June 26, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

Lyme disease was first identified in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut, after a group of children and adults reported unusual arthritis-like symptoms. By 1977, 51 cases of what became known as “Lyme arthritis” were documented. In 1982, scientists discovered the cause: the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by black-legged ticks.
The Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helped define and track the disease, shaping early research and response efforts. Since 1995, the state has averaged about 2,700 reported cases each year.
According to the CDC, Connecticut ranked among the top 10 states for reported Lyme disease cases nationally in 2023. New York reported the most, with 22,173 cases that year. Factors like suburban development and reforested land contribute to Connecticut’s high risk.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.

“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”

The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

Josh Stein on Thursday vetoed three Republican-sponsored bills that seek to ban diversity, equity and inclusion in public schools, universities and state government, calling the legislation a distraction from more pressing issues facing the state. 
The bills — Senate Bill 227 targeting K–12 education, Senate Bill 558 focused on UNC System schools and community colleges, and House Bill 171 aimed at state and local government agencies — had all passed along party lines in recent weeks. Each sought to bar DEI offices, training programs, and what Republicans called “divisive concepts” related to race and gender from public institutions.
In a news release announcing the vetoes, Stein accused lawmakers of fueling “culture wars” and neglecting urgent state business.
“At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, the legislature failed to pass a budget and, instead, wants to distract us by stoking culture wars that further divide us,” Stein said in a statement. “These mean-spirited bills would marginalize vulnerable people and also undermine the quality of public services and public education. Therefore, I am vetoing them. I stand ready to work with the legislature when it gets serious about protecting people and addressing North Carolinians’ pressing concerns.”
These measures are part of Republican-led efforts to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms, and that DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex. 
But opponents say the language in the bills is overly broad and would have wide-ranging consequences, chilling speech in classrooms and dismantling DEI offices that support students, workers, and communities who have long faced structural barriers.
In a recent NC Newsline story, educators expressed concern that the measures would prevent them from teaching essential parts of American history.
Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate and could override Stein’s vetoes there without Democratic support.

Josh Stein on Thursday vetoed three Republican-sponsored bills that seek to ban diversity, equity and inclusion in public schools, universities and state government, calling the legislation a distraction from more pressing issues facing the state. 
He also vetoed House Bill 805 — a catchall bill that includes a collection of conservative social agenda priorities, including provisions that target transgender individuals and provide parents with expanded rights to challenge school library books.
The DEI bills — Senate Bill 227 targeting K–12 education, Senate Bill 558 focused on UNC System schools and community colleges, and House Bill 171 aimed at state and local government agencies — had all passed along party lines in recent weeks. Each sought to bar DEI offices, training programs, and what Republicans called “divisive concepts” related to race and gender from public institutions.
In a news release announcing the vetoes, Stein accused lawmakers of fueling “culture wars” and neglecting urgent state business.
“At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, the legislature failed to pass a budget and, instead, wants to distract us by stoking culture wars that further divide us,” Stein said in a statement. “These mean-spirited bills would marginalize vulnerable people and also undermine the quality of public services and public education. Therefore, I am vetoing them. I stand ready to work with the legislature when it gets serious about protecting people and addressing North Carolinians’ pressing concerns.”
The DEI measures are part of Republican-led efforts to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Republican lawmakers say the legislation is meant to restore fairness and ideological neutrality in classrooms, and that DEI programs promote a worldview that “stifles opportunity” and “stokes division” by encouraging students to judge others based on race or sex. 
But opponents say the language in the bills is overly broad and would have wide-ranging consequences, chilling speech in classrooms and dismantling DEI offices that support students, workers, and communities who have long faced structural barriers.
In a recent NC Newsline story, educators expressed concern that the measures would prevent them from teaching essential parts of American history.
House Bill 805 raised a special level of ire among Senate Democrats who objected to the fact that the measure started out as a noncontroversial House proposal targeting revenge porn and was only amended to include several controversial culture war provisions in the Senate.
Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate and could override Stein’s vetoes there without Democratic support. In the House, however, the GOP is one vote shy of the three-fifths supermajority needed for an override and would need at least one Democrat to cross party lines if all members are present and voting.

(File photo by Getty Images)Duke Energy is again seeking to increase electricity rates, this time for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers across the upper third of the state.
Less than a year after the utility last raised rates in the Upstate, power bills for those Duke Energy residential customers there could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026, roughly three years since the utility last raised rates for those customers.
“We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers.” Duke Energy’s South Carolina president, Tim Pearson, said in a statement.
In filings with state regulators, the North Carolina-headquartered company said it built 600 miles of new power lines and 6,800 transformers in 2023 and 2024.
It’s also seeking to charge South Carolina customers for a $90 million share of maintenance to its nuclear power plants, a $34 million share of its gas plants, a $43 million share of hydropower and an $11 million share of batteries for a solar farm.
In addition, the company wants to replenish its storm response fund in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Three months after the massive storm swept across the Southeast, knocking out power to 4.7 million customers in nine states, the company’s reserve fund had a negative balance of $23 million, the company wrote in documents filed with the state Public Service Commission.
“Duke Energy Carolinas just raised its rates less than a year ago, and now they are asking to hike bills once again. If its request is approved, residential customers’ bills will be nearly $23 a month higher than July 4th of last year,” said Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Kate Mixson.
All of SC’s major power providers could receive approval to hike rates by year’s end

Not to mention, the new rate hike, if approved, could take place before the old rate increase even goes fully into effect.
Rates are already set to bump again in the Upstate on Aug. 1, 2026, as federal tax credits are set to expire and the second stage of the last rate hike kicks in.
Tax credits passed during the first Trump administration would be extended as part of Republicans’ massive tax and spending package titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which could receive a final vote Wednesday.
But it’s unclear whether Duke would continue to pass any new savings from an extension on to its customers.
The pair of rate hikes also come on the heels of a mammoth new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis.
Utility executives say the process, coined as rate stabilization, raises rates on a smaller-but-more-frequent basis, making it easier for those on a fixed income to adjust. It also guarantees companies continue to receive the maximum rate of return allowed by regulators.
Utilities still go before regulators annually for up to five years to seek permission to raise prices. Rate payers can still protest, and regulators still have the final say over whether expenses meet the necessary requirements for an increase.
But the process is less in depth than the rate cases Duke is currently undertaking because it doesn’t call into question a utility company’s allowed profit rate.
Mosier said Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool.”
Still, in regulatory filings, company representatives wrote that Duke is “pursuing a strategy of more timely, incremental rate requests.”
“While this rate case stands on its own, it reflects the spirit of that legislation, which promotes making proactive, thoughtful investments that strengthen energy security and help keep South Carolina attractive to new businesses and families and well-positioned for the future,” Mosier said in a statement.
The company is asking regulators to approve a 10.85% profit rate in both the Upstate and PeeDee, compared to the 9.94% rate it locked in last year in the Upstate.
Mixson, whose organization was among several environmental and consumer groups to negotiate down Duke Energy’s last rate hike proposal, called it “striking but not surprising.”
“There is no incentive for efficiency. There is no incentive for them to be sharp with their pencil now. And there’s no incentive to make sure they’re getting the lowest bid. It does not matter anymore because they will get their set profit,” said Frank Knapp, president of the Small Business Chamber of Commerce.
The Pee Dee rate change is scheduled to be considered by the state Public Service Commission in October 2025. A date has not yet been set for the Upstate rate change.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-932311582-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 13:16:56.727750

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Courtesy of Pheasants Forever)Pheasants Forever has enrolled a new landowner in its Public Access to Habitat (PATH) program that will open nearly 30,000 new acres of private land to public hunting and recreation in northwestern South Dakota.
Pheasants Forever is a nonprofit conservation group that works to improve habitat and expand public access to hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts. The group’s Ziebach County project is the largest single enrollment of the PATH initiative, which launched in South Dakota and Nebraska in 2023. 
With this addition, the program has opened 62,581 acres of privately owned land to public access across South Dakota through 59 contracts in 31 counties.
The program complements the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Walk-In Area program, which pays landowners $1.50 to $2 per acre to open land for public access.

Public Access To Habitat offers landowners up to an additional $25 per acre to further incentivize high-quality habitat to be enrolled in the state’s Walk-In Area program. Landowners must enroll eligible acres in PATH for 10 years.
Habitats — including shelterbelts, wetlands, conservation easements and grasslands — enrolled in the program must remain untouched, except for necessary management tasks (such as emergency grazing for livestock). Biologists work with landowners to ensure enrolled acres are productive for wildlife.
 South Dakota Tourism and onX Hunt, a hunting GPS service, funded the initiative’s first year in the state with a $250,000 grant. South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks and onX continue to support the project.
The newly enrolled 29,725 acres of rolling plains support pheasants, grouse, deer and pronghorn, according to Pheasants Forever.
“Since we launched PATH in South Dakota, the program has proven we can have a profound impact on the quality of both access and habitat across the entire state,” said Casey Sill, a spokesman for Pheasants Forever.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The average cost for a 10-person Fourth of July will cost $70.92, which is 30 cents less than last summer, but the second highest cookout cost since 2013 when American Farm Bureau Federation began its annual survey on the topic. 
Beef, canned goods and hand-picked crops have the highest price increases from last year, due likely to low domestic cattle inventory, aluminum tariffs and the cost of labor. 
The American Farm Bureau survey assumes a gathering of 10 people who will consume: cheeseburgers, chicken breasts, pork chops, potato chips, canned pork and beans, fresh strawberries, homemade potato salad, fresh-squeezed lemonade, chocolate chip cookies and ice cream.
Canned of pork and beans had the steepest increase, 8.2% or 20 cents, from last year. The bureau said labor costs along the supply chain and steep tariffs on aluminum are likely to blame.

Homemade lemonade will also cost 20 cents more per pitcher this year, and strawberries 8 cents more per pound, due to a continued trend of high labor costs in the specialty crop sector. 
The cost of ground beef also increased to $13.33 for two pounds, which is nearly 60 cents more than the $12.77 cost in 2024. While normally a crowd favorite, it will cost families nearly $20 to make 10 cheeseburgers this weekend, according to the survey prices. 
  The annual cookout cost survey from American Farm Bureau shows a slight decline from 2024, but still a high cost for the holiday gathering. (Graphic courtesy of American Farm Bureau Federation)
U.S. cattle herd size has been declining since 2019, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the 2025 herd size was 8% lower than 2019 herd. The amount of beef imported to the U.S. has also gone up in the time frame. 
Pork chops, on the other hand, had the largest decrease in price from last year. Three pounds of pork chops this weekend should run consumers about $14.13, which is nearly 9% less than the cut cost last year. The survey concludes this is due to high domestic pork supplies.
The cost of chicken breasts declined slightly from last year’s cookout prices but the cost of eggs increased, which made potato salad about 20 cents more expensive this year. Poultry have been affected by the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has caused fluctuating prices as the supply chains are impacted. 
Since January, U.S. has imported about 10 times the amount of shell eggs it imported in the same period in 2024 as part of the administration’s plan to combat the bird flu. Wholesale egg prices have declined by more than 60% since January, but the American Farm Bureau report shows the cost for consumers for just four eggs is up 54% from last summer. 
The bureau survey also breaks prices down by region and found cookouts on the East Coast are the cheapest this year at $63.79, followed by the south who can feed a party of 10 for $68.93. Gatherings in the West average at $73.50 and Midwestern gatherings come in as the second most expensive at $69.87. 
Farmers not pocketing fair share, advocates say
Consumer increases don’t necessarily mean higher prices for farmers, however. On average, farmers and ranchers receive about $0.16 per consumer dollar spent on food, according to the latest “Farmer’s Share” report from National Farmers Union. 
Rob Larew, the organization’s president said it’s important to highlight the “growing imbalance” in the food system. 
“Family farmers and ranchers are working harder than ever, yet taking home less, while corporate monopolies in processing, distribution, and retail rake in record profits,” Larew said. “Farmers deserve a fair share of the food dollar, and consumers deserve a food system that works for everyone, not just a handful of powerful corporations.”
According to the report, a rancher takes home $2.08 on a one pound package of ground beef sold for $5.99. A lettuce farmer gets an even lower cut, receiving about 8.2% of the consumer dollar.
Consumers also feel like their dollars don’t stretch as far. According to the latest food and farm index from Iowa Farm Bureau, price is the number one factor for Iowa shoppers as they fill their grocery carts, even as more consumers say they want to buy locally raised products. 
Christopher Pudenz, an Iowa Farm Bureau economist, said price changes in Iowa-grown commodities “mostly reflect” supply and demand cycles. 
“The Fourth of July is, of course, a celebration of our freedom but also a celebration of the American spirit, one embodied by our nation’s farmers,” Pudenz said in a press release. “Despite challenges like rising costs and weather impacts, Iowa farmers continue to do what they’ve always done—work hard, adapt and provide for American families.”

As drunk driving remains a deadly and persistent issue across the United States, new data reveals Delaware is leading the nation in prevention, with the lowest number of DUI arrests per capita.
According to a national analysis of drunk-driving statistics, Delaware reports just 43 drunk-driving arrests per 100,000 drivers, placing it at the very bottom of the list for DUI rates. That figure stands in stark contrast to states like South Dakota (879 arrests per 100,000 drivers) and North Dakota (833), which lead the nation in DUI arrests and are labeled as the country’s “drunk-driving capitals.”
Other low-ranking states include Illinois (70), Florida (94), and Louisiana (116). While every state has laws banning driving under the influence, the data suggests that enforcement, public awareness, access to transportation, and state-specific programs all play a role in how often drunk driving occurs.
Officials in Delaware say they are encouraged by the ranking but remain focused on prevention. Jeffrey Horvath, Deputy Director of the Delaware Office of Highway Safety, stated that the state is proud to see its efforts reflected in the data, but emphasized that the work is far from over.
RELATED STORY: Free Lyft and Uber vouchers offered to Delawareans this July 4th to prevent drunk driving
“It is very encouraging that Delaware has one of the lowest DUI rates in the nation when comparing arrests per 100,000 drivers,” said Horvath. “However, the Delaware Office of Highway Safety believes that even one impaired driver on our roadways is far too many. Impaired driving is a very serious issue that endangers lives, causes preventable crashes, and devastates families and communities across our state.”
Horvath emphasized the agency’s ongoing efforts. “The Delaware Office of Highway Safety is committed to the mission of reducing impaired driving through enforcement, education, and outreach to keep our roads safe for everyone.”
The dangers of drunk driving
Nationwide, 37 people die every day from drunk-driving crashes—that’s about one death every 39 minutes. Each year, over 13,000 lives are lost, and 300,000 people are treated in emergency departments due to alcohol-impaired driving injuries.
Despite the known risks, drunk driving remains prevalent across the U.S., with more than 1 million arrests annually and 1 in every 50 American drivers caught under the influence over the past five years. States with large rural populations tend to report higher rates, partly due to less access to public transit and fewer sobriety checkpoints.
RELATED STORY: Teen driving deaths alarmingly high with Delaware ranking among worst states
Many states are turning to ignition interlock devices, which prevent a vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected, to combat repeat offenses. These devices are now mandatory for DUI offenders in 34 states and have been shown to reduce repeat drunk driving by 67%.
Fourth of July weekend reminder: Use Sober Ride Programs
As the Fourth of July holiday approaches—a time when alcohol-related crashes often spike—Delaware’s Office of Highway Safety (OHS) is once again offering its Sober Rides program to encourage safe travel and prevent impaired driving.
Through the initiative, Delawareans can claim free ride-share vouchers worth up to $20 for use on Uber or Lyft during the holiday.

(Monty Rakusen via Getty Images)TOPEKA — American Lung Association advocacy director Sara Prem doesn’t want to internalize consequences of the Sunflower Electric Power Corp. securing a two-year exemption from tighter limits on pollution at its electricity plant in southwest Kansas.
Sunflower’s generating station at Holcomb was among 68 coal plants in two-dozen states given permission by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sidestep elevated mercury and arsenic controls set to take effect in July 2027. The reprieve was tied to President Donald Trump’s executive order in April that said lack of technology and national security considerations could make compliance too onerous for U.S. plants generating power by burning coal.
“We’re creating the risk of more pollution in that community,” Prem said. “With these coal plants, you’re getting a lot of pollutants. It’s not just mercury. Inhaling those particulates can lead to a wide range of health effects.”
She said amplified restraints on emissions from coal plants could save lives because reliance on the fossil fuel damaged people’s lungs, made children susceptible to illness and contributed to climate problems.
The Trump administration shouldn’t have abandoned reforms President Joe Biden delivered to the country’s 200 coal-fired facilities, Prem said.
In 2024, Biden’s EPA directed utilities to adhere to elevated emission standards for toxic metals and to implement a 70% reduction for mercury releases at plants fueled by brown coal. The Democratic president required generating stations making use of coal to address 90% of carbon pollution.
To qualify for Trump’s presidential exemption, Sunflower Electric was told to send an email request to the EPA and await the president’s response. Sunflower Electric was the lone coal plant in Kansas to get an exemption, but others were awarded in Oklahoma and Missouri.
Hays-headquartered Sunflower Electric, which is owned by cooperatives serving 58 counties in central and western Kansas, didn’t respond to requests for comment about the exemption. On social media, Sunflower Electric celebrated Trump’s work to derail Biden’s amended emission rules.
“Sunflower is encouraged by the EPA’s recent actions to address regulations impacting electric cooperatives,” Sunflower Electric said. “As electricity demand soars, it’s essential to have policies that ensure reliable, affordable power while protecting the environment.”
The Holcomb plant years ago deployed scrubbers and other technology to limit release of pollution in a process that burned coal, heated water and pushed turbines to generate electricity.
In March, Sunflower Electric announced start of construction on its third solar power project. The facility near Dodge City would — if completed — be the largest solar complex in Kansas. The cooperative previously collaborated on solar projects near Russell and closer to the Holcomb coal plant in Johnson City.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported coal’s share of the nation’s power generation had fallen under 20% after supplying approximately half of the country’s electricity in 2000. Natural gas and renewable sources, including solar and wind, absorbed coal’s market share.
Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said the reprieve for coal plants addressed “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable” rules advanced late in Biden’s term. The association said Biden’s rules would have been costly to utility companies.
“They will jeopardize the reliability of the electric grid for as long as they remain in effect,” Matheson said.
The federal Clean Air Act included provisions enabling a U.S. president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new regulations.
Trump said the exemptions were necessary because emission-control technology required to meet Biden’s mandate wasn’t widely available in a commercially viable form. In addition, the president said adherence to his predecessor’s rules raised “the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects.”
“The (Biden) rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our nation’s coal sector,” Trump’s order said.
A coalition of 12 environmental and community organizations filed a lawsuit in June against the Trump administration for the alleged illegal use of presidential authority for benefit of the exemptions.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, which is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the majority of coal plants given exemptions had cleaning equipment installed that could meet — or has met — the safer pollution limits. The council said one-fourth of coal units receiving an exemption were scheduled to retire within 5 years.
Prem, the Kansas and Nebraska advocate for the American Lung Association, said Trump’s bid to breathe life into the coal industry meant exempted coal-burning units could avoid installing continuous monitoring equipment to alert communities of excessive emissions.
The real-time data was to have been provided to regulators to track compliance with emissions restrictions, she said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Among the North Carolinians who will have the stability of their lives disrupted by the massive Medicaid funding cuts and policy changes making their way through Congress right now in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” are many of the people I and my colleagues work to assist at the Raleigh-based nonprofit, Healing Transitions.
As our website explains, Healing Transitions offers innovative peer-based, recovery-oriented services to homeless, uninsured and underserved individuals with alcoholism and other drug addictions. Our program is specifically designed to rekindle a person’s desire and ability to return to a meaningful and productive life.
Over the last year, we have made some especially encouraging progress by getting clients with medical issues enrolled in Medicaid. Now, when they finish the program after a year or more, they leave with a job, drug-free housing, connectivity to the recovery community, and a relationship with a primary care physician through Medicaid coverage. The latter arrangement results in better management of chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. These men and women have less emergency visits and less hospitalizations.
Unfortunately, under the terms of giant budget reconciliation bill advancing in Washington, this progress is in jeopardy. Under the Medicaid changes contained in the legislation, enrollees will be subject to new work requirements and mandated to undergo periodic re-registration to verify their employment. While work requirements themselves will not be a problem for our clients, the administrative hassle of complying will undoubtedly cause problems.
The inevitable result: Medicaid coverage will lapse in some cases and so too will the patient’s relationship with their primary care physician and their management of health issues. Health care costs will inevitably increase, and health quality will decline.
In the few states where work requirements for Medicaid coverage have been previously implemented, administrative costs have exceeded savings in healthcare expenditures. Also, deficient compliance with these administrative steps have brought interruption of Medicaid coverage.
In the United States, we spend twice as much per person as other industrialized nations on health care, and we have worse health outcomes. Our average life expectancy is lower, and we have more preventable deaths. We are the only industrialized nation without health insurance in one form or another for all citizens. Why can we not learn from those examples?
Sadly, the proposed Medicaid cuts will double down on our failed model. With congressional approval of this “big, beautiful bill” our nation will move in the wrong direction when it comes to both healthcare costs and health outcomes.
Do we care? By all indications, far too many of our elected leaders do not.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 10:03:55.673317

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
Elliott Hinkle experienced depression and suicidal thoughts even before entering the foster care system in Casper, Wyoming, at age 15. 
At the time, Hinkle, who is transgender, struggled with their sexual identity and gender issues, and their difficulties continued in foster care. They felt like they had no one to confide in — not their foster parents, not church leaders, not their caseworker.
“To my knowledge, I don’t remember ever taking a suicide screening,” Hinkle said. “No one ever said: ‘Are you having thoughts of taking your life? Do you feel hopeless?’”

With their psychological and behavioral health needs left unaddressed, Hinkle’s depression and suicidal thoughts worsened.
“Do I stay in the closet and feel terrible and want to end my life?” Hinkle said. “Or do I come out and lose all my supports, which also feels dangerous?”
Children in foster care are significantly more likely to have mental health issues, researchers say. They attempt or complete suicide at rates three to four times that of youths in the general population, according to several studies.
LGBTQ+ people in foster care, like Hinkle, are at an even higher risk of having suicidal thoughts. 
Yet despite the concentration of young people at risk of serious mental illness and suicide, proactive efforts to screen foster children and get them the treatment they need have been widely absent from the system. And now, efforts underway to provide widespread screening, diagnosis, and treatment are threatened by sweeping funding cuts the Trump administration is using to reshape health care programs nationwide. 
In June, federal officials announced they would shut down a suicide hotline serving LGBTQ+ youths as part of those cuts.
Children in foster care use a disproportionate amount of Medicaid-funded mental health services. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s massive budget package working its way through Congress contains substantial shifts in Medicaid funding and policies that are projected to drastically reduce services in many states.
“I think anybody who cares about kids’ well-being and mental health is concerned about the possibility of reduced Medicaid funding,” said Cynthia Ewell Foster, a child psychologist and clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan psychiatry department. “The most vulnerable children, including those in foster care, are already having trouble getting the services they need.” 
A lack of federal standards and other system-level issues create barriers to psychological and behavioral care in the child welfare system, said Colleen Katz, a professor at Hunter College’s Silberman School of Social Work in New York.
“When you’re talking about anyone getting screened for suicide ideation upon entrance into the system, it’s inconsistent at best,” she said.  
Katz said all children entering foster care should have a brief, standardized suicide screening embedded into their initial medical assessment. And more screenings need to be conducted throughout a foster care stay, she said, because youths getting ready to transition out of the system are also vulnerable.  
Hinkle, now 31, said the summer before they aged out of the system was “one of the darkest periods, because I was coming to terms with the church not wanting me to be gay and I was about to lose stable housing and whatever foster care support there was.”
Katz studied transition-age youths in foster care in California, which has the highest numbers of placements in foster care nationwide. According to her analysis, 42% of study participants had thoughts of taking their life and 24% had attempted suicide, and she expects findings would be similar in other states.
Katz also examined suicide screening tools and found many that already exist could work and be easily administered by trained child welfare workers or alternative frontline service providers, or embedded in existing mental health services.
Still, the quality of services varies by state and locality and can hinder attempts to curb suicides. 
Julie Collins, vice president of practice excellence at the Child Welfare League of America, which advocates for improvements to the child welfare system, said the gap in suicide prevention in foster care mirrors the overall nationwide void of behavioral health services for children and adolescents. “The preparation of people coming into the field isn’t what it needs to be,” Collins said of the lack of training for caseworkers.
Ewell Foster is trying to change that. 
She worked with the state of Michigan to redefine and update the competencies required to earn an undergraduate certificate in child welfare in the state. Eighteen colleges and universities that offer certificate programs in child welfare in Michigan now teach about suicide prevention. 
  April Miller entered the foster care system in Minnesota at age 3 and said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. “The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” she said. (Couresy photo)
“It’s something the workforce has asked for,” Ewell Foster said. “They need real clear guidance on what to do when they are worried about someone.”
So far, Ewell Foster’s effort to change the wider system has not run into any roadblocks. Her work with Michigan’s child welfare agency is still being funded under a grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
Agency spokesperson Danielle Bennett said such grants will continue for up to three years. 
However, the future of the federal agency has been in question for months. The Trump administration has laid off hundreds of its employees and has proposed folding its functions into another agency. 
Some states have made changes to address the foster care gaps on their own, but often it has taken legal action to spark changes in suicide prevention efforts.
In Kansas, officials made several changes after the state settled the McIntyre v. Howard class action lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of foster children who the suit alleged were subjected to inadequate access to mental health resources and moved from home to home frequently.
The state increased salaries for social workers in the child welfare system and reduced their caseloads, among other things. 
Other states, including Texas, have implemented similar changes after facing lawsuits.
Still, experts caution that the changes taking place in foster care systems are not enough to steer outcomes. 
Lily Brown, an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, said moving the needle in suicide prevention will require implementing a universal risk assessment for children in state care. 
Brown recently sought a grant to fund and implement free, universal suicide risk screening in foster care throughout Pennsylvania. She had several counties agree to the project, but not enough to support her application — the study wouldn’t have had enough participants to work statistically, she said.
Without such studies, foster care systems nationwide can’t meet the needs of children, she said. 
April Miller, 27, entered the system in Minnesota at age 3. As a Native American, she is part of a group that is overrepresented in foster care. 
“The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” said Miller, who said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. 
“I did a lot of self-harm and had thoughts of suicide but didn’t have access to means, which is why I am still alive,” she said.
Today, Miller is a social worker and suicide prevention coordinator in Bemidji, Minnesota.
Similarly, Hinkle’s experience in the system made them driven to change the trajectory of other young people.
Hinkle provides training, consultation, and policy development services at Unicorn Solutions in Oregon in support of youths and young adults affected by systems such as child welfare, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community. 
They said they are committed to making sure that sexual identity and gender topics are not avoided in the system.
“I think every young person should feel loved and cared for,” Hinkle said.

According to a press release by the American Pyrotechnic Association, U.S. firework companies rely almost entirely on China to produce 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional fireworks displays. The release also states that the current rate “remains unmanageable for most industry operators,” and adds that currently there is “no viable domestic manufacturing alternative at scale.”
 Many of the tariffs for 2025 arrived so late in the fireworks season that businesses were not “contractually able,” to pass on costs to customers but future tariffs could lead to an increase in consumer costs according to APA.
“Fireworks are an iconic part of America’s celebration of freedom,” said Julie L. Heckman, APA executive director. “This isn’t about politics. It’s about making sure communities can continue to celebrate while giving small businesses a path forward through supply chain challenges.”

(Photo by Emily Grason/Washington Sea Grant)On a sandy beach in a state park in Ketchikan, a group of local beachcombers encountered something ominous: shells of two invasive European green crabs, shed as part of the creatures’ growth process.
That discovery, made during a June 6 beach survey that was part of a class held by the University of Alaska Southeast Ketchikan campus, led to more in the community.
It makes Ketchikan the newest known Alaska beachhead in a northward invasion of non-native crabs that are known to wreak havoc on native species and habitats.
European green crabs, first confirmed to be in Alaska when their shells were discovered in 2022 on Annette Island in the far southeast corner of the state, are likely here for good, said the UAS professor who was one of the class instructors and helped lead the beach surveys.
“They have continued to spread. They will continue to spread,” said Barbara Morgan, who is based in Ketchikan. “They are expected to spread through Southeast Alaska, probably most of Southcentral — kind of the southern coast of Southcentral. And maybe, depending on water temperature and how tolerant they are to the colder water temperatures, they might go up into the really southern part of the Bristol Bay area, too.”
In time, they could threaten some of Alaska’s most important habitats for salmon and other fish.
The crabs eat salmon fry, juvenile native crabs like Dungeness and other fish, and they mow down eelgrass beds that are important Alaska fish habitat.
“Green crab could potentially damage Alaska’s multi-billion dollar fisheries industries, especially for salmon, crab, and mariculture operations,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned.
European green crabs were first found in waters of the U.S. East Coast in the 1800s, believed to have been transported in ships’ ballast water. In 1989, the first green crabs were discovered in U.S. West Coast waters, also believed to have been carried accidentally in ballast water. Over the following years, they spread northward. The first sightings in British Columbia were in 1998.
The Alaska first discovery, at Annette Island, was about 30 miles south of the beach site where Morgan’s class found the crab shells in June. And last summer, green crab shells were found at Gravina Island, just west of Ketchikan.

	An eventual discovery in Ketchikan was largely expected. But the precise site of the June 6 discovery — at Refuge Cove State Recreation Site — was a bit surprising because of the nature of the site, Morgan said.
Green crabs generally prefer estuarine areas, places where freshwater and saltwater meet, and places with thick eelgrass, she said. But the Refuge Cove beach site is sandy and not an estuary, and thus not considered to be a prime spot for the crabs.
Crabs’ upper shells, called carapaces, are discarded periodically as the animals grow and need larger shells. Discovery of the molted shells suggests that the invasive crab were in the larval stage when they were pushed by currents north to Alaska, Morgan said.
After the first two shells were found during the class survey, the discoveries in the community “snowballed,” with additional shells found at Refuge Cove, plus more at other sites along the Ketchikan road system, she said. It is likely that there are more at other sites that are less accessible for surveys, she said.
How to respond?
The species’ name can be confusing because the crabs are not necessarily green, Morgan said. They can be brown or yellow or reddish, or a mixture of colors, she said. Meanwhile, some native crabs that do belong in Alaska are green, including kelp crabs, and should not be mistaken for the invaders, she said.
The “European” part of the name is not accurate, either, she said. “Yes, they came from Europe; they’re not in Europe anymore,” she said.
Morgan and other invasive species experts are trying to spread awareness — and the message about what the crabs look like. Telltale signs come from the shape of the shells, which have three bumps between the crabs’ eyes and five spikes on either side.
The Metlakatla Indian Community, a Tribal government on Annette Island, has been particularly active in combatting European green crabs.
The Tribe established a detection program in 2020 and made the first discovery of shells in 2022, as well as the Gravina Island discoveries last year.
Through its program, the Tribe has also trapped thousands of European green crabs. The total had reached about 3,000 as of last summer, according to the Department of Fish and Game, and it continues to grow.

After that first discovery, the Metlakatla Indian Community-NOAA Fisheries team found more carapaces, some dead crabs and dozens of live crabs. (Photo by Linda Shaw/NOAA Fisheries_
 

	In just the past month, the Tribal team trapped over 300 of the live crabs on Gravina Island, said Ian Hudson, a fisheries biologist who coordinates the Tribe’s European green crab program.
“This year there has been an explosion in numbers, and we’re not at all surprised that Ketchikan is finding carapace,” he said by email.
Metlakatla’s efforts are highlighted in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s 2023-2028 plan for combatting European green crabs. That plan lays out steps for prevention, early detection, rapid response and control.
But by now, full prevention may not be possible anymore, Morgan said.
With millions of European green crabs on the West Coast, and with currents that continue t send their larvae north, it is highly unlikely that all incursions could be prevented, she said.
“Even if we get rid of all of them in Alaska, we would need to build a fence across Dixon Entrance, a fine net. And that’s obviously not going to happen,” she said, referring to the maritime border site between Canada and Alaska.
Instead, she said, “functional eradication” like what the Metlakatla Indian Tribe is doing with trapping is likely to be increasingly important, with focuses on key sites important to native species like salmon and Dungeness crab. Baseline surveys can help identify those areas that need to be most protected, she said.
Part of a wider invasive threat
While the European green crab is considered to be among the world’s most damaging invasive species, it is not the only one that threatens Alaska’s environment and fishing industry.
Another example is elodea, a freshwater plant often used in aquariums. First found in Eyak Lake in Cordova in 1982, it has spread to other lakes and streams in Southcentral and Interior Alaska. Potential economic losses — to commercial sockeye salmon and to recreational floatplane pilots — could be well over $1 billion, Tobias Schwoerer, a University of Alaska Fairbanks economist, estimated in a 2017 study.
Invasive northern pike in Southcentral Alaska, which have proved to be persistent, also pose ecological and economic threats. The fish prey on salmon, trout and other native species. The Department of Fish and Game has a program to remove invasive pike and try to limit their spread.

	For now, much of the work to combat nonnative species is coordinated by the Alaska Invasive Species Partnership, a coalition of government agencies, university experts, nonprofits and community organizations.
The partnership has advocated for years for the establishment of a more robust organization within state government, an invasive species council, to organize wider protection and rapid response, if needed.
Bills pending in the Alaska Legislature would do that. One measure, House Bill 191, made it through one committee. A Senate version, Senate Bill 174, has not had a hearing, however.
In past years, similar bills progressed through the Legislature but failed to make it to final passage. The most recent was in 2022, when a bill to establish a state invasive species council passed the House by 33-2 margin but failed to reach the Senate floor before that session’s adjournment.
Proponents hope results in the coming session will be more successful.
The sponsor of the current House bill, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, worries not only about green crabs moving their way through Southeast Alaska but also invasive plants like knotweed that have appeared in important community spots like Harbor Mountain.
“Each year, there’s more knotweed and less salmonberries,” she said in an interview late in the session. She hopes the bill will win final passage next year, she said.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is another proponent of an invasive species council.
He said he has been aware of invasive species since his childhood in Cordova, where he and a friend earned money from a neighbor by killing invasive black slugs at about a nickel apiece. Later, as a member of the Anchorage Assembly, he worked on efforts to remove invasive chokecherry trees, which were introduced as ornamentals but have since crowded out native species along the city’s greenbelts.
Dunbar acknowledged concerns that an invasive species council would cost the state money because it would require a dedicated employee in the Department of Fish and Game. But he argues that failing to set up such a council would cause more expense in the long run.
“I would say, we can’t afford to not prevent invasive species from entering Alaska,” Dunbar said in an interview near the end of this year’s session. “It is very expensive to have invasive species to start pushing out native species.”

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is celebrating the Fourth of July and will return to your inboxes on Monday.
Faced with steep budget cuts, phone lines that provide free mental health support to tens of thousands of residents across California have begun layoffs and the elimination of crucial services, reports CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener.
These so-called “warm lines” assist people during non-emergencies, offering emotional support and mental health resources. Parents Anonymous’ helpline, which serves about 24,000 people a year and is endorsed by First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, has already laid off staff. The organization requested $3 million a year from the state, but the budget deal Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers hammered out last week did not include funding.
Pomona resident Antonia Rios said she contacts the helpline as much as seven times a week. Rios is a mother of seven, and lives with anxiety, depression and other mental health afflictions. For Rios, “it breaks my heart they want to cut” the helpline.

Rios: “The helpline was a safe haven for me. It saved my life on many occasions.”

In Orange County, the warm line for the National Alliance on Mental Illness fields 900 calls a day, according to its Chief Executive Amy Durham. The organization is now preparing to let go of 127 staffers, many of whom used the warm line themselves and later became peer counselors. 

Durham: “Now we’re going to wait until everyone’s in crisis. I can’t imagine it’s cost effective or humane.” 

The nonprofit that oversees the California Peer Run Warm Line, which I reported about in June, requested $15 million a year in renewed funding. Because it received only $5 million this budget year, it will shut down its Spanish-speaking helpline that it also provides, writes Jocelyn.

To save the state a projected $1 billion in the next few years, Newsom and the Legislature approved a state budget deal that also includes a provision, in the form of a trailer bill, to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for adult immigrants who do not have legal status. 
The Legislature approved the budget mostly along party lines, but four Democrats who are part of the 35-member Latino Caucus voted against the Medi-Cal cuts or abstained from voting, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Their opposition shines a light on the fine line Latino Caucus members must walk between cutting state spending and expanding health care access for immigrants. The caucus is one of the most influential political blocs in California, and has historically championed bills related to health care, labor and education that support immigrants without legal status. 

Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat who voted against the Medi-Cal cuts: “It’s the ‘othering,’ … we’ve created a hierarchy of what human is eligible and what human is ineligible.”

Lawmakers shelve eviction relief bill

Underscoring how difficult it is to pass renters’ rights legislation in the face of big spending from business and landlord groups, a bill that would have given renters more time to pay past-due rent before being evicted failed to advance out of committee last week.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, renters are currently allowed three days to pay their past rent before landlords can begin the eviction process. A proposal by Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat, would have extended that to two weeks. 
The measure didn’t get enough votes to pass through the Assembly’s judiciary committee — highlighting the rift between progressive Democrats who support more rental protections and those concerned with the rights of landlords.
Landlord associations, groups representing the building industry and business groups including the California Chamber of Commerce, opposed the measure. Since 2015 these groups have donated at least $13.7 million to state lawmakers since 2015.

Ron Estes of Kansas honored the memory of one of his congressional interns who was shot to death in Washington, D.C.
Estes offered condolences to the family of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, of Granby, Massachusetts. The Metropolitan Police Department reported Tarpinian-Jachym was the victim of a shooting Monday night in northwest D.C.
Law enforcement officials said multiple people stepped from a vehicle and opened fire on a group of individuals, striking Tarpinian-Jachym, an adult woman and a teenager. All three were taken to a hospital, where Tarpinian-Jachym died Tuesday.
“I will remember his kind heart and how he always greeted anyone who entered our office with a cheerful smile,” Estes said in a joint statement with his wife, state Rep. Susan Estes. “We are grateful to Eric for his service to Kansas’ 4th District and the country.”
The Kansas congressman asked for prayers on behalf of Tarpinian-Jachym’s family and asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation has proposed fare increases to all Metro North and CT Rail services in the state. (Photo by Dana Edwards/CT Mirror)Connecticut is planning to raise fares on Metro-North Railroad and CT Rail transit throughout the state later this year in order to cover the increased cost of operating rail services.
Fares are slated to rise by 5% beginning Sept. 1, and another 5% on July 1, 2026. That means a rush-hour one-way trip between New Haven and Stamford on Metro-North, for example, would rise from $8.75 to $9.50 by July of next year. An off-peak one-way trip between Hartford and New Haven on CT Rail would rise from $8.25 to $8.75, and a one-way trip from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North during peak hours would rise from $16 to $17.75 by this time next year. 
Officials with the state Department of Transportation said the fare increase was necessary to keep the trains running.
“The cost to operate the existing level of service has increased year over year,” said Dan Baker, a transportation supervising planner with the department during a public meeting in Stamford on fare increases. “So in order to maintain the current level of trains and rail service and account for rising costs, fares needed to increase to offset a funding gap.”
DOT had requested $327 million from the state to cover the cost of rail services in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, but the legislature’s budget only included $316 million. The increase in fares will make up for that gap, officials said.
Connecticut last increased fares in 2023 when the Hartford line, New Haven line and Shore Line East faced a 4.5% increase. Before that, fares had stayed the same since 2018.
Baker said even with the planned increases this year and next, inflation will still have surpassed rail fare increases. Since 2018, inflation has driven up consumer prices by approximately 28%, whereas by 2026 rail fares will have increased by 14% to 15%, according to DOT data.
Fares account for roughly half of Metro-North’s operating costs, but a far smaller slice — less than 10% — of the Hartford and Shore Line East rail lines’ operating costs. Most of the rest of the funding comes from the state.
Many lines faced service and funding cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridership has rebounded unevenly across lines since then.
Over that same period, the state has invested in new transportation and development projects, like the Connecticut River bridge connecting Old Saybrook and Old Lyme.
Commuters’ concern

	
Some commuters expressed opposition to the state’s plan to raise fares, noting problems with the current service, including its delayed restoration after the Covid cutbacks, and general frustration about the rising cost of living throughout the state.Susan Feaster, a frequent commuter on Shore Line East rail, said riders shouldn’t be on the hook for the state not fully funding rail transit. “Fare increases are never good, and doing a complete 10% by next year is a lot,” said Feaster, who also founded the Shore Line East Riders Advocacy Group in 2018.
Feaster said lawmakers boosted funding for child care and education in the coming biennium budget, which will enable many parents to work. “But you know, they should probably put some of that money into mass transit to help the people trying to get to work to pay those taxes, right?” she said.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council, said, “While I recognize the necessity of increasing rail rates and the fact it’s been a while since the last increase, I have serious reservations about raising bus and transit fares.” (Currently, bus fares aren’t slated to increase, though the Governor proposed bus fare hikes earlier this year.)
“These services are vital for many individuals facing economic challenges, and now may not be the right time to impose additional financial burdens on them,” he said.
DOT officials said they performed a service and fare equity analysis to assess the effects fare increases would have on low-income and minority customers. “We found that the proposed fare increases for 2025 and 2026 for Hartford line, Shoreline east and New Haven line do not have a disparate impact on minority customers, nor a disproportionate burden on low income customers, whether analyzed individually or in aggregate,” Baker said.
DOT held several public meetings to hear concerns from riders about the fare increases, but turnout was low. In Stamford last Monday, two residents attended. In New Haven last Tuesday, only one resident was there. And in Hartford last Thursday, only a small handful of residents were present.Jon Bonci, a CT Rail passenger who attended the Hartford event, said he wasn’t confident his presence would change the state’s plans. “We’re gonna have to pay it, so what can you do? It doesn’t matter what we say in the public hearing,” he said.Stamford resident Nicole Howerton expressed concern at the DOT’s public meeting at the Ferguson Public Library there.
“As a resident of Stamford and a sole [commuter] for my family, it plays a major role in being able to get around and enjoy the community,” Howerton said. “When we’re presenting an increase of some nature, we need to look at the schedule and see if and how that’s meeting the community.”A frequent commuter through the Metro-North’s West Haven station, she added that when rail service is down she has to take Ubers, which is another additional cost.Chris Irby, the only registered speaker at the New Haven public meeting, pointed to Bridgeport as an urban area that would be significantly affected by the fare hikes. As a Bridgeport resident and a frequent commuter, he said that Bridgeport residents already struggle to find money for the fares.
“Bridgeport is not a business city like New Haven is,” Irby said. “Everybody has to take the train to go to other towns, to go to work.”
Irby also called on DOT to do a better job of advertising the events, stating that he would like to see more of DOT’s presence and advertising in downtown New Haven.
The department held additional public hearings virtually on June 30 and July 1. Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto will consider public comments through July 6, via email to dot.proposedtransitchanges@ct.gov or by leaving a voicemail at (860) 594-3612. DOT will take all comments into consideration before finalizing the proposed fare changes, officials said.

UVM Medical Center, Burlington


Tom Whitney died on June 21 following a stroke. Tom was the oldest of five siblings born to Bill and Alli Whitney of South Burlington. Tom liked to say he learned about hard work doing farm chores, though future endeavors suggest that kind of work was not for him. Tom’s story reflects a series of grand passions that resulted in an interesting life.
While in high school, Tom developed a passion for photography and set up a darkroom. Tom left home after graduation, looking for what the world had to offer. He joined the Navy for three years, then settled in Los Angeles with his wife, Elvie Moore, and their two sons. Tom and Elvie became social justice advocates: Elvie was a published playwright highlighting racial inequalities, and Tom became part of The Grantsmanship Center, publishing an award-winning magazine about applying for grants.
Tom lived in Sacramento and taught at Folsom Prison, then worked as graphic designer for Regional Transit. He volunteered with many environmental and urban planning and development projects. His efforts caused enough “good trouble” for Tom to earn an Environmentalist of the Year award. While in Sacramento, Tom met and married Betsy Palmer, who established a company that translated text into Braille, while Tom managed graphic design.
Tom later moved to Hilo, Hawaii. He documented Hawaiian culture and had several museum exhibitions of native spiritual practices on Mauna Kea. Photography, reading, and writing dominated this period of his life. He published several books: The Book of Years and Celebrating the Hawaiian Culture.
Tom is survived by his son, Abdullah Taalib Sankofa and wife, Dina; his sisters Mary Campbell and Sara Denny; and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by two siblings, Alice and David, his son Julien, and his wives.
In 2019, Tom returned to Vermont. He was pleased to find a welcoming community at Three Cathedral Square. The family wants to thank Tom’s many friends at Cathedral Square for their kindnesses near the end of Tom’s life.

One of the most powerful political blocs in California, the Latino Caucus had to balance reining in Medi-Cal’s rising costs with helping undocumented immigrants. All but four overcame their misgivings and voted to freeze new enrollment and make other cuts to immigrant health insurance.



Moments before an important budget vote last week, state Sen. María Elena Durazo stood on the Senate floor and spoke passionately about the plight of immigrants’ health care in California. She lambasted the Legislature’s choice to freeze Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants without legal status and charge monthly premiums.
The Senate’s budget negotiations and headlines had long since turned toward a different crisis — housing reform — but Durazo stayed firm. 
Durazo said she was joyful when the state opened Medi-Cal to all low-income residents regardless of immigration status just a year and a half ago. Now “that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame, and that joy has turned into betrayal,” Durazo told her colleagues on the Senate floor.
The Democrat from Los Angeles issued a clarion call to the public and to her colleagues: “Remember today’s date and what the Senate is doing.”
Durazo’s stand and subsequent vote against the Medi-Cal cuts stood out among a sea of Democratic yes votes. She was joined in opposition by three other members of the state Latino Caucus who voted against or abstained from the measure.
For more than a decade, the 35-member Latino Caucus has championed the expansion of Medi-Cal to immigrants, passing the baton from each new class of lawmakers to another. No one has been more outspoken about the proposed cuts than its members, Democrats who self-identify as Latino or Hispanic, many of whom spent the past month joining rallies on the steps of the Capitol and fiercely debating the impacts.
But the state’s $12 billion deficit put the Latino Caucus in a bind, forcing them and their party to make difficult decisions about walking back health care during a year when the state has too little revenue and too many expenses. 
Many legislators in the caucus say that California is cruelly balancing its budget on the backs of poor immigrants. They’ve argued that California is creating a state-sanctioned, two-tiered health system where some residents are considered “less than.”
Yet, despite some misgivings, the emotional nature of the cuts and the fervor of the rhetoric, nearly all of the caucus — 30 members — voted to approve them within the larger health care budget package.
Under the agreement finalized last week by the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom, in six months, California will freeze new enrollment of adult immigrants who do not have legal status in Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income residents. In one year, non-citizens 19 and older will lose dental benefits, and in two years, most of the adults must pay a $30 monthly premium. Combined, these changes are projected to save California about $1 billion in their initial implementation years, growing to more than $4.3 billion ongoing.
The Latino Caucus, whose members make up 36% of Democratic Assemblymembers and 43% of senators, is one of the most powerful political blocs in California. The caucus historically carried bills to support immigrants without legal status through changes in health care, labor and education.
The decision to cut medical benefits for immigrants was an agonizing one for the Latino legislators as they’ve watched the Trump administration wage an aggressive deportation campaign against immigrants in Southern California and the Central Valley, calling them criminals and reportedly rounding them up at job sites, bus stops and their homes. More than 75% of unauthorized immigrants in California are from Mexico and Central America, according to a 2019 analysis from the Migration Policy Institute.
“There are so many members who share my feelings about needing to maintain health care for all, while also ensuring we’re fighting for everything else on the budget we voted on.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER CELESTE RODRIGUEZ, DEMOCRAT FROM ARLETA
The lawmakers wrestled with the bleak necessity of Medi-Cal cuts after multiple years of deficits. Some say the programs that they were able to save in the budget, such as home care for immigrants and other Medi-Cal enrollees, are worth defending even if the other cuts are painful.
“There are so many members who share my feelings about needing to maintain health care for all, while also ensuring we’re fighting for everything else on the budget we voted on,” Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, a Democrat from Arleta who voted for the Medi-Cal cuts, said in an interview with CalMatters before the final budget was approved.
Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys who joined Durazo in voting against the Medi-Cal changes, has consistently opposed cutting benefits for immigrants. “Our actions have consequences and those consequences will cause people to lose health insurance,” she said.
Her outspoken opposition apparently landed her in hot water with some in the party leadership. Last month, her office said Menjivar was removed from a key budget subcommittee because she opposed the Medi-Cal cuts. 
Menjivar said she can’t support policies that single out a specific demographic. “It’s the ‘othering,’ where we’ve created a hierarchy of what human is eligible and what human is ineligible,” that she can’t stomach, she said.
For Durazo, “it’s the specific targeting of immigrants. That’s the problem.”

Health advocates rallied against the cuts for weeks and pressured lawmakers to walk back even deeper cuts proposed by Newsom. A coalition of groups representing health advocates, immigrant rights groups and labor lined the sidewalks on a recent day as lawmakers walked into the building to vote on an earlier version of the budget that mirrors some of the final provisions. Their chant of “health for all” has been a rallying cry for the expansion since 2013.
“We can’t say we believe in universal health care…and say we’re going to make exceptions for this one population,” said Mar Velez, director of policy for the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California.
Undocumented immigrants “not only pay nearly $8.5 billion in taxes in California, they build businesses, and raise the next generation of lawyers, doctors, and elected officials… They too, deserve to be treated with dignity by ensuring their health is prioritized.”SEN. LENA GONZALEZ, DEMOCRAT FROM LONG BEACH 
Caucus chair Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Long Beach Democrat who abstained from voting on the Medi-Cal cuts, told CalMatters that her “conscience couldn’t bear freezing Medi-Cal benefits for hard working immigrants” especially in the face of immigration enforcement raids throughout Southern California. Assemblymember Sade Elhawary, a Democrat and Latino Caucus member from Los Angeles, also abstained, along with Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas from Los Angeles, who is not a Caucus member.
Gonzalez said the cuts represent a “huge setback” for Californians struggling with affordability, especially when immigrants are “at the core of our economy.”
Undocumented immigrants “not only pay nearly $8.5 billion in taxes here in California, they build businesses, and raise the next generation of lawyers, doctors, and elected officials, just like the members of this California Latino Legislative Caucus,” Gonzalez said in a statement. “They too, deserve to be treated with dignity by ensuring their health is prioritized.”
During emotional debates, some legislators who voted in favor of the cuts characterized them as a best-case scenario that prevents anyone from getting kicked off of Medi-Cal, while others said many people will lose coverage as they struggle to make payments and drop off the rolls.
Some of the compromises worked into the budget include provisions to delay the cuts and try to prevent current enrollees from losing coverage. Under the new law, the freeze  includes a three-month grace period for re-enrollment should someone fall off of Medi-Cal because of paperwork errors or temporary income increases. Youths who are already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not “age out” once they turn 19. 
The monthly premium and cut to dental benefits apply to non-citizens, including some with legal status like visa or green card holders, but only adults aged 19 to 59 will be required to pay the premium while all adults will lose dental.
Few other options to cut the deficit as Medi-Cal costs surge
The state spends more than $190 billion a year on the entire Medi-Cal program, about 60% of which comes from federal funds. About $12 billion of state-only revenue pays for immigrant health care.
Lawmakers have been grappling with funding the state’s Medi-Cal program, which insures 15 million Californians, for months. Earlier this year, legislators injected billions of emergency dollars into Medi-Cal to keep it solvent.
Rising health care costs and increased senior enrollment fueled a majority of the $6.2 billion shortfall. But finance officials indicated that about $2.7 billion resulted from higher spending on immigrant health care, which the state pays for without federal assistance.
Paired with the deficit Democrats had few options to balance the budget.
Elana Ross, a spokesperson for Newsom, defended the budget as one that preserves the state’s “commitment to immigrant communities.” In a statement, she blamed the increasing cost of health care, more people enrolling and President Donald Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, for causing the state’s projected revenues to decrease by about $16 billion.
“Because of these outside factors, the state must take difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the long-term viability of Medi-Cal for all Californians,” Ross said.
“This is not about whether you support or oppose immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants. We value that. But I think a lot of Californians have concerns about prioritizing non-citizens with scarce taxpayer resources.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARL DEMAIO, REPUBLICAN FROM SAN DIEGO 
The move to cut immigrant benefits and bail out Medi-Cal earlier in the year gave political leverage to the state’s Republican lawmakers, most of whom have opposed the expansion for years. Ahead of the budget vote, many Republicans criticized the state for irresponsibly expanding a program that was already stretched thin and is frequently plagued by long wait times, lack of specialists and other access challenges.
All Republican legislators voted against the Medi-Cal bill and every budget bill despite their criticisms of Medi-Cal expansion, citing other fiscal concerns with the Democrats’ budget deal.
The state simply can’t afford the program for immigrants, said Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego, one of the most outspoken critics of the expansion, last week during the budget vote. 
“Let’s be very clear. This is not about whether you support or oppose immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants. We value that,” DeMaio said on the Assembly floor. “But I think a lot of Californians have concerns about prioritizing non-citizens with scarce taxpayer resources, at the same time that we’re cutting services for the neediest citizens in our communities.”
Voting for immigrant cuts with mixed emotions
Rodriguez, who voted yes on the cuts, said she was torn over the budget decisions because she feels responsible for protecting immigrants in her community. When she was younger, Rodriguez said she used Medi-Cal and knows the program is essential for many people in her district.
She grew emotional during budget debates while speaking about the cuts, but told CalMatters her support ultimately hinged on recognizing that she and her colleagues fought successfully to save many safety net programs, including home care and reproductive health services. She said the deal to delay some of the Medi-Cal cuts is a partial win because it gives the Legislature time to contemplate additional revenue streams. 
Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, a doctor and Democrat from Fresno, voted no on a previous version of the budget that cut immigrant health but voted in favor of the final budget agreement.
Arambula, who worked as an emergency room physician before becoming a lawmaker, said many of his past patients would come in with serious but preventable conditions related to diabetes or heart disease because they could not access primary care.
“I remember their stories. I remember their faces,” Arambula said in an interview before the final budget vote. “I would see these patients in their last minutes of life, and knew that there was so much more that we could be doing in advance.”
Arambula declined to comment on his yes vote.
Looking toward the future of medical care
Velez said the fact that several Latino Caucus lawmakers voted no matters because without their voices, it telegraphs to constituents that everyone believes “It’s OK to do this” when many people oppose it. But in the end, there weren’t enough votes to stop the cuts from happening and she said that will irrevocably damage the trust built over years between advocates, government officials and immigrants.
“We’re at a crossroads where legislators, the governor and the state of California can put us back on the right track to make sure California is seen as a sentinel for protecting immigrants.”CARLOS ALARCON, CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER 
Some lawmakers have floated the idea of requiring large employers whose employees primarily use Medi-Cal to contribute to the program though no details have emerged. 
“I know I have colleagues who are committed to ensuring health care is truly accessible to all,” Rodriguez said. “We’ll get back to a place where we can fulfill the commitment that was made.” 
Carlos Alarcon, a health policy analyst with the California Immigrant Policy Center, said now that the budget is final, it’s time for the lawmakers who initially said they want to stop the cuts to “put their money where their mouth is” and find solutions.
“We’re at a crossroads where legislators, the governor and the state of California can put us back on the right track to make sure California is seen as a sentinel for protecting immigrants,” Alarcon said.

(File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)It’s no secret that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are trying to decimate climate programs and environmental protections. We see evidence of this every day, in executive orders, public pronouncements, policy initiatives and funding decisions.
But in Maryland, we take comfort knowing that many state and local elected officials see themselves as a bulwark against the worst of Trump’s positions and impulses. Whether they’re filing lawsuits to reverse Trump edicts, enacting legislation that serves as a counterbalance to regressive federal policies, promoting the use of clean energy or outlining bold goals to confront climate change, Maryland leaders are often at the forefront of environmental advocacy.
So why now are Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) dragging their feet when it comes to advancing and protecting aggressive vehicle emissions standards and mandates regarding the sales of clean cars and trucks?
On June 12, Trump signed three measures striking down waivers that allowed Maryland and several other states to impose stricter emissions standards on cars and trucks than federal laws allow. The rules have also allowed Maryland and the other states to set a timeline for phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks.

Within hours after the president signed these measures, setting into motion Congress’ use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke the three waivers, 11 of the 12 states that were impacted by his action, led by California, filed a federal lawsuit to preserve their right to use more stringent vehicle emissions laws.
The only hold-out? Maryland. That’s a disappointing and dangerous development that, given the state’s history and rhetoric about the imperative of climate action, requires an explanation. So far, we have yet to hear any.
California has long been the acknowledged leader on state-based climate policy. And for more than two decades, the Golden State’s vehicle emissions regulations have been stronger than federal rules. Starting with New Jersey in 2004, 11 other states and the District of Columbia have elected to follow California’s emissions standards; Maryland signed up in 2007, requiring cars beginning with the 2011 model year to have stronger emissions standards than vehicles sold in most other states.
Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) briefly paused the state’s participation in the multistate alliance, but as soon as Moore took office, he renewed Maryland’s commitment to California’s more stringent standards for autos, signing up for a new initiative known as Advanced Clean Cars II, and also ensured that Maryland would follow that state’s lead on strict emissions standards for trucks. Among other things, the rules mandate phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, with the phase-out beginning with model year 2027.
The logic behind stricter emissions standards and more aggressive goals for electric vehicle sales is irrefutable. Vehicle emissions are a primary cause of air pollution in the state, and reducing them has myriad public health benefits.
By the state’s own estimates, between 2027 and 2040, Maryland’s participation in Advanced Clean Cars II would dramatically scale back emissions of nitrogen oxides, a precursor to ground-level ozone; particulate matter, which creates significant respiratory problems; and carbon dioxide, a major driver of climate change. By 2040, the state projects that these reductions will create a public health benefit of $603.5 million a year due to decreases in respiratory and cardiovascular illness and associated lost work days.
So Maryland’s retreat from these tougher standards is puzzling and distressing – and sadly, it did not begin with the state’s decision not to sign on when other states sued the Trump administration earlier this month. During the most recent General Assembly session, the legislature came close to passing a bill that would have paused penalties for two years on auto dealers who did not meet the state’s aggressive standards for selling electric and hybrid vehicles. Ultimately, the governor issued an executive order with the same result.
Maryland officials have said they’re as committed as ever to clean car standards. But when meeting the goals becomes voluntary, without strict state enforcement and penalties, those statements ring hollow. The governor’s executive order, coupled with the state’s decision not to join other Advanced Clean Cars states in the new lawsuit against the federal government, must, for now, be seen as a retreat in Maryland’s commitment to fight climate change and air pollution.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EV-charging-station-1.jpg,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

Tony Evers signed the budget, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 15, at 1:32 a.m. in his office Thursday, less than an hour after the Assembly passed it. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers signed the $111 billion two-year state budget bill into law overnight following a marathon day of overlapping Senate and Assembly floor sessions where the bill received bipartisan support from lawmakers. The budget cuts taxes by $1.3 billion, makes investments in the University of Wisconsin system, boosts public schools’ special education reimbursement rate to 45% and allocates about $330 for child care. 
Evers signed the budget, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 15, at 1:32 a.m. in his office Thursday, less than an hour after the Assembly passed it. Just before signing it, he thanked legislative leaders for working with him and said the budget reflects the fair legislative maps that he signed into law in 2024 and that were in place during November elections. 
“We need to work together,” Evers said. 
As the Assembly and Senate prepared to meet for debate Wednesday evening, Evers was outside of the east wing of the Capitol for Concerts on the Square and telling people not to “drop meatballs” on themselves. 
“I was actually chatting with people about tonight outside,” he said. “Many of them were saying ‘How about that? Compromise.’ Compare that to what’s going on in Washington, D.C., and it’s significantly different, so I’m very proud to sign it.”
The passage and signing of the state budget comes two days after the end of the fiscal year.
Following months of negotiations and the announcement of a deal between Evers, Republican legislative leaders and Senate Democrats on Tuesday, the Legislature worked for about 15 hours Wednesday to get the bill over the finish line.
Their goal was to get the bill signed by Evers before the federal reconciliation bill made it to President Donald Trump’s desk.
One reason for the rush was a provision in the state budget that increases a Medicaid-related hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6%, the current federal limit, to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources. It’s estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional Medicaid revenue that will go back to Wisconsin hospitals, but the state’s ability to make that change is set to be restricted under the federal bill.
“We want our health care system to be in good shape, and in order to do that, we’re going to need help from the federal government,” Evers said. 
Governor uses partial veto
In addition to signing the budget, Evers exercised his partial veto on 23 items . He had agreed not to partially veto any part of the deal that he came to with lawmakers, but other pieces of the legislation were fair game. 
Evers vetoed language that set 2029 for closing Green Bay Correctional Institution. He said he supports closing the facility, but said more needs to be done before a date is set.
“We need more compromise on that. We need to get things going before we start taking people out of Green Bay,” Evers told reporters. “Saying that we’re going to do Green Bay by ’29 doesn’t mean a damn thing.”
He also partially vetoed $750,000 in grants to the Lakeland STAR Academy, a Minocqua charter school that specializes in serving students with autism and diverse learning needs; vetoed language excluding two of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes from a grant program; and vetoed $25,000 for a street project in the village of Warrens. 
In addition, he vetoed funds for five projects that would go through the Department of Natural Resource. 
“I object to providing an earmark for a natural resources project when the Legislature has abandoned its responsibility to reauthorize and ensure the continuation of the immensely popular Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program,” Evers stated in his veto message. 
Lawmakers said they are still working on legislation to continue the program. “Instead of renewing the program and helping the many, the Legislature has opted to benefit the politically connected few,” Evers wrote.  “The Legislature must do its job and renew the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program.”
Evers said if he would change anything about the budget, he would have wanted “more in the area of specificity in child care.” The budget will spend about $330 million on child care including $110 million to extend direct payments to providers for another year, $65 million to a new program for providers serving 4-year-olds and $123 million to increase the reimbursement for child care costs for low-income families under the Wisconsin Shares program.
Evers also rejected the calls of some advocates that he veto the entire budget, noting the uncertainty that could result and the funding that could be put at risk by starting from scratch on a budget.
“Failing to reach consensus and vetoing this budget in its entirety was an untenable option, not just for me, but for the people of our state,” Evers wrote in his budget message. 
Evers told reporters he wasn’t caught off guard by the number of Democratic lawmakers who didn’t support the budget.
“They have to do what they think is right, and everybody’s kind of looking for what’s going to happen in a couple years, and so I’m not surprised,” Evers said. “But there’s a whole bunch of Republicans that supported it so God bless them.” 
Republican lawmakers also said throughout the day that the prospect of losing hospital funding if the budget wasn’t signed ahead of the federal reconciliation bill moving through Congress played a role in wanting to get the budget done as quickly as possible.
“That’s why we’re working really fast to get it done,” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said during a press conference Wednesday morning. “We will get the bill to the governor’s desk prior to the President [Trump] signing the Big Beautiful bill.”
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said at a mid-afternoon press conference he expected Evers would sign the legislation late Wednesday or early Thursday.
“It’s about a billion dollars that will be able to flow to an awful lot of rural hospitals, people who are taking care of those with urgent needs,” Vos said. “We want to get it done and we want access to those dollars.”
Senate approves budget 19-14  
The Senate took action on the bill first, passing it 19-14 shortly after 9 p.m. Five Democratic senators, including Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton), joined 14 Republicans to pass the bill. Four Republicans, including Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk), voted with the 10 Democrats against the legislation. 
Democrats’ votes were needed to pass the budget bill in the Senate after several Republicans expressed concerns about the legislation. Hesselbein was at the negotiating table as a result. 
The hospital funding, which led to lawmakers rushing work to pass the budget in one day, was also the top reason that Felzkowski voted against the budget.
Democrats voting yes, in addition to Hesslebein, were Sens. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D- Appleton), Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska), Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Jamie Wall (D- Green Bay).  Republicans voting no, in addition to Felzkowski were Rob Hutton (R- Brookfield), Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R Whitewater).
Felzkowski said she felt bad because there were good things in the budget, but that she was appalled the budget didn’t address the cost of health care, noting Wisconsin has the fifth highest health care costs in the country.
Felzkowski said that there should be other health care reforms if hospitals were going to get a “windfall” of over $1 billion a year and blamed Evers and hospital lobbyists for opposing those, including additional hospital price transparency measures.
“Gov. Evers, you failed Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said. “You failed constituents. You failed employers.” 
Evers rejected the claims, calling them “bulls – – t.”
“The people that work in those hospitals are working real hard,” Evers said. “The last thing we need is to have hospitals going belly up in the middle of the pandemic or something.” 
Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), who voted no, mentioned Evers’ previous vetoes of Republican tax cuts and said the current budget bill leveraged those vetoes “to hide the 12% increase in spending” as well as a structural deficit.
“In a time of economic uncertainty, when our spending decisions warrant further restraint and discernment, we need a budget that creates proper spending priorities and puts taxpayers first,” Hutton said. 
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) called the budget an “orgy” of spending in a statement explaining his “no” vote. Implicating fellow Republicans, he criticized lawmakers for spending the state’s $4.3 billion surplus on one-time earmarks and “funding for special interests” instead of larger tax cuts.
Despite the handful of opponents, the majority of Senate Republicans supported the budget, touting the tax cuts that they secured and some of the investments.
LeMahieu called it “a responsible budget that invests in core priorities” and touted the $1.4 billion tax cut. 
At the Senate GOP press conference Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) singled out some of the University of Wisconsin system funding that will “put the thumb on the scale…to help some of those campuses like UW Platteville that have had declining enrollment over the last decade.” The budget allocates $53 million for UW system funding, distributed through two formulas: one for declining enrollment and another for the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
The University of Wisconsin system will also get $840 million for capital projects, $94 million for staff wage increases, $54 million for recruitment and retention and $7 million for virtual mental health services.
Sen. Dan Feyen (R-Fond du Lac), who voted yes, said the budget didn’t do everything he wanted it to do and included some things he didn’t support. 
“I always have, and always will, advocate for a smaller, smarter state government,” he said in a statement. “I’m glad to see that this budget cuts over 300 vacant positions from state government.”
Feyen highlighted his support for special education funding and child care provisions in the document. He said if people want a more “conservative” budget, then Republicans would need to expand their majority and elect a Republican governor in 2026.

Senate Democrats, whether they voted for or against the bill, all had a similar message: it doesn’t do enough. 
“What we have on the floor today is better than it would have been if Senate Dems had not been at the table, but let me be clear, it is not perfect,” Hesselbein said at a Wednesday morning press conference. She described the budget as a “bipartisan deal” where “everybody left the table wishing it was different, but this is something that we can agree on trying to move forward.”
Asked about the advocates who called for lawmakers to vote against the budget and Evers to veto it, Hesselbein said she knew some people were upset.
“I’m glad they’re making their voices heard,” she said. “That’s why today, we’re going to be fighting for every single Wisconsinite.”
Day of drama delayed
The Senate convened a little after 10:30 a.m., but didn’t pass the bill until after 9 p.m. 
The first several hours of debate centered on Senate Democrats’ 25 proposed amendments  that ranged from increasing funding for the UW system, K-12 education and child care to expanding postpartum Medicaid. The body got through about half of those amendments before pausing for several hours to caucus.
During the delays, Republicans were working on a 35-page “technical amendment” with several changes, including an added requirement that the UW system conduct an efficiency study on declining student enrollment and future operations. 
When the Senate reconvened around 7 p.m., it tabled the rest of the Democratic amendments and started debate on the full budget bill. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said Democrats helped improve the budget but that it l would not allow people in Wisconsin to thrive.
“We understand the urgency to act. Congress is actively restricting our future funding. This budget must move forward, but that does not make it a good budget,” Spreitzer said.
The budget broke the “rule of 17” — the Senate Republicans’ practice of making sure 17 members support a measure before it’s put on the floor — Spreitzer said, and criticized them for not breaking the rule to pass other measures, including postpartum Medicaid expansion or funding for the Knowles-Nelson Conservation program in a bipartisan way. “Wouldn’t it be easier to just get it done today?” he said. 
Spreitzer said the Democratic votes on the budget were not an endorsement, but were rather an acknowledgement that it was better than it would have been without bipartisan negotiations. Asserting that the budget didn’t deserve one more vote than was necessary to pass it, he voted against it.
Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said the optimism after Evers introduced his budget in February soon faded and criticized the governor for not fighting harder for his priorities.  The result is “grossly” insufficient and “will do more harm than good,” he said
“It’s a ‘failure to fight’ budget,” Larson said. “This budget is cowardice. We all deserve so much better.” 
Assembly passes budget 59-39 
“We have a guarantee that we’re going to have a transformation budget that works for everyone,” Vos said during the Assembly floor debate. “I assume, like in the state Senate where Democrats and Republicans are going to vote for the budget, we would have the same thing here in the Assembly, if people are serious about saying we want to work together.” 
The Assembly concurred in the bill 59-39 at around 12:40 a.m. Seven Democrats voted with Republicans in favor of the bill: Reps. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), Steve Doyle (D-Onalaska), Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire), Maureen McCarville (D- DeForest), Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh), Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) and Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby). 
One Republican  — Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) — voted with Democrats against the bill. Rep. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) was not voting.

Assembly Co-Chair Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the budget process this time was different from any other that he’s worked on. This is his fourth as co-chair of the Joint Finance Committee. 
“We did spend more time working with the governor’s office, the governor and Democrats,” Born said, and called the budget  “more conservative”  than the state’s 2023-25 budget, to his surprise. He noted that the $1.3 billion tax cut will get signed into law, unlike previous tax cuts that Evers has vetoed. 
The budget spends the state’s estimated $4 billion budget surplus down to about $800 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The budget also has a 6% increase in general purpose revenue spending and a 12% increase overall.
While Republicans highlighted the bipartisan nature of the budget and measures included, Democrats throughout the day focused on their critiques and the measures that didn’t make it in.
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said at a press conference Wednesday morning that she was appreciative of Evers and Hesselbein for being at the negotiating table and getting what they could — but it wouldn’t be enough to win her vote. 
“This proposal is a far cry from the budget that Assembly Democrats would have written,” said Neubauer. She said she was not at the table when the budget deal was made.  With a 54-45 majority, Assembly Republicans had the votes to pass the budget without the Democrats, Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said at a GOP press conference.
Neubauer said that as a consequence, the Assembly Democrats “were not part of those negotiations.”
School districts will get an increase in the special education reimbursement rate from about 32% to 42% in the first year of the biennium and 45% in the second year. It will be the highest that the rate has been in many years, but still lower than the 60% advocates and Democrats wanted.
Democratic lawmakers said that without increases in general aid or schools, districts will have to continue relying on property tax increases to keep up with costs.
“You didn’t set out to stop the cycle of [property tax increase] referendums, you set out to continue it,” Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) said on the Assembly floor. “When 96 of 99 Assembly districts have gone to referendum recently and the statewide demand for public school funding increases isn’t partisan for our constituents, why are we fighting so hard to get Republicans to adequately fund our schools? This isn’t a Democrat versus Republican issue across the state, and it shouldn’t be a Republican versus Democrat issue in the state Capitol.”
The four-member Wisconsin Legislative Socialist Caucus — including Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) and Francesca Hong (D-Madison) — voted against the bill. In a joint statement they called the agreement between Republican lawmakers, Senate Democrats and Evers a “catastrophic failure of leadership that surrenders to Republican austerity.” They cited the lack of a general school aid increase for public schools, the special education reimbursement not meeting 60% and the failure to expand Medicaid.
“This is not a compromise, this is capitulation,” the caucus said.
Assembly Republicans mostly focused on the parts of the state budget they were appreciative of but also took jabs at Democrats for saying they would vote against the bill. 
The Agriculture Roads Improvement Program, which was created in 2023 to support local agricultural road improvement projects statewide, will get an infusion of $150 million. 
“That’s a big deal in my community and up in the rural part of the northwest,” Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) said. “It helps our state’s largest industry by improving the quality of our roads to get their products and goods out and inputs and services that farmers need into the field as well.” 
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) said lawmakers committed to providing tax cuts for seniors and Wisconsinites as a whole through the elimination of the utility tax, a policy Evers had advocated for. 
“I know that some people on the other side of the aisle said that people are not seeking tax relief,” Rodriguez said. “Yes, they have been. You just haven’t been listening.”
The Office of School Safety, housed in the Department of Justice, will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million in the budget.
The office provides training and grants to schools for safety and runs the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns. Funding for the office became a flashpoint of criticism in the 2023-25 budget debate. 
Rep. Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville) touted the new budget’s provision for the office and spoke about working with Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul on getting the funding in this year’s budget. He also credited lawmakers on the finance committee for helping to keep the office going.
“The process is ugly, but working together to get something done is a really great thing, so I will defend this budget. I will run on this budget,” Novak said.
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said on the floor that lawmakers who voted against the budget shouldn’t take credit for any of its accomplishments in the budget later  or attend groundbreakings for projects it funded.“If you vote against this, do not show your face,” Kurtz said. “You didn’t have the courage to vote yes.”

WINDSOR — First responders recovered what is believed to be the body of a missing 14-year-old girl from Kennedy Pond on Wednesday evening.
An investigation into the death is ongoing, Windsor Police Chief Bill Daniels said.
The girl is from the Burlington area, according to Lt. Charles Winn from the Vermont State Police dive team. Further information about the girl’s identity was not immediately available.

The girl is believed to have been at the pond with “friends of the family,” Daniels said while on the scene.
The VSP team recovered the body less than 100 feet offshore between the docks and a yellow floating raft at about 5:30 p.m., after 45 minutes of searching.
In addition to the VSP team, the Hanover dive team responded to the call at about 12:15 p.m. for a water rescue, as did Windsor fire and police departments.
Emma McCumber, who grew up in Windsor but now lives in Massachusetts, was swimming at the pond with her kids when she heard screams from the beach from those who noticed the girl was missing.
“Immediately the lifeguards hopped into action,” McCumber said when she returned to the pond hours later to check for updates.

Before police cleared the water of all swimmers, McCumber, along with some dozen other bystanders, searched for the girl herself for about 45 minutes.
“It was an amazing community effort,” she said.
Without any diving equipment besides goggles, the bystanders attempted to do a grid search. “We went down as deep as we could but it was pretty useless. There’s really long weeds in that area. You can’t see your hands in front of your face.”
Told the girl had pink hair, the bystanders searched for the distinctive feature in the water.
“We just kept looking for pink hair,” McCumber said.

Wednesday’s incident was the latest water-related death in Vermont this summer.
Late last month, there were three drownings in Vermont in the span of five days, VTDigger reported.
An 18-year-old Burlington High School student died after jumping into the water at Bartlett Falls in Bristol on June 21.
A 30-year-old employee of Basin Harbor Club in Ferrisburgh drowned in Lake Champlain on June 24.
Another man was found dead further north in Lake Champlain near Red Rocks Park in South Burlington on June 25.

It’s the latest setback for progressive lawmakers seeking renter protections.,"In summary
California Democrats were split on a proposal that would have extended an eviction grace period for tenants who fall behind on their rent. It’s the latest setback for progressive lawmakers seeking renter protections.


Sen. Aisha Wahab implored her colleagues to think of hospitalized patients and struggling families as she pitched a proposal to give tenants a full two weeks to pay their past due rent before their landlords could start the eviction process.
“This is a very small ask from the state of California,” Wahab, a Democrat representing the Fremont area, recently told her fellow lawmakers. “(It’s) very small to allow people 14 days to either ask for family members and loved ones to give them money to stay housed, to ask their cities or any of the other nonprofits that help people with rental assistance stay housed, or to even be able to wait for their check.”
Despite Wahab’s pleas, her Senate Bill 436 failed to advance out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee last week.
It was the latest example of progressive Democrats’ struggles to add protections for California’s 17 million renters, despite lawmakers otherwise taking aggressive steps this year to address the state’s housing and homelessness crises.
Just this week, after a decade of failed efforts, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to reform the state’s signature environmental law to stop activists from using it to block housing construction. The proposal easily passed the Senate and Assembly, despite angering the state’s influential environmental groups.
But when it comes to giving tenants more power and easing some of the nation’s highest rents, California voters and the 120 senators and Assembly members who represent them have largely balked.
Last fall, California voters decisively shot down a rent-control initiative that would have allowed local governments to block landlords from raising rents. A more aggressive rent-control measure never received a hearing this spring in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, even though it was authored by San Jose Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the committee chair.
Another bill to limit fees landlords can charge tenants on top of monthly rent was held until at least next year, despite the author being San Francisco Assemblymember Matt Haney, the chair of the Assembly Housing Committee.
The stalled bills were a remarkable display of how difficult it is for lawmakers to pass rental protection measures since committee chairs usually are influential. Wahab chairs the Senate Housing Committee. 
Her measure, which would have extended the start of the past due eviction process from three days to two weeks, is the latest setback for the Legislature’s 10-person legislative Renters’ Caucus, which counts Wahab and Haney as members.
Renter protections divide Democrats
What makes the death of Wahab’s bill especially unusual is that it happened during a committee hearing in public view and featured Democrats joining Republicans to shoot it down. As CalMatters reported, most legislation killed in the California Legislature dies quietly behind the scenes, without a vote. It’s also rare for Democrats to vote “no” on a fellow Democrat’s bill.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s debate highlighted the tensions between the Democratic supermajority’s progressive and more moderate members on rental protections.

Downey Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco, an attorney, said she used to represent landlords in eviction proceedings, and said the current three-day rule is just the start of an “eviction process can easily take two months, three months, four months.”
“I worry about these mom and pop landlords,” she said. “I worry about these seniors who are going to have a hardship because they rely on this money for their expenses, for their mortgage, for whatever they need. And we’re putting them in a very bad situation.”
Kalra, the committee’s chair, is also an attorney, but he saw things from the renter’s point of view. 
“They’re renters because a lot of those in the previous generations were able to buy homes 30, 40, 50-plus years ago that are completely unaffordable now,” he said. “Was that their fault (previous generations) were able to do that? Absolutely not. Is it their fault that they now can rent those properties out for a handsome sum? Absolutely not, but that’s the reality of the situation we’re in.”
Noting that Consumer Affairs recently ranked California as one of the worst states for renters, he said the proposed extra 11 days “actually allows the problem to be resolved before you even get to that (eviction) process, which is to everyone’s benefit.”
Landlord advocacy groups and other critics of the bills also note that California already has among the strongest state renter protection laws in the country.
Landlords and bankers spend big
The bill needed seven votes to pass. It got six. Kalra voted for the measure, joining five other Democrats on the committee, including Isaac Bryan of Culver City and Alex Lee of Milpitas, both members of the renters caucus. 
Pacheco cast a “no” vote, one of only seven times she’s done so in 2,271 voting opportunities so far this year, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
The three Republicans on the committee also voted “no.” Two Democrats, Diane Papan of San Mateo, and John Harabedian of Pasadena, didn’t vote, which counts the same as voting no.

The death of the eviction relief measure also points to the David vs. Goliath-sized discrepancies in the political spending between renters’ and landlords’ advocates.
The bill’s supporters included around two dozen legal aid, social services and renters’ advocacy organizations, but those groups have spent next to nothing on state politics, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
Opposing the bill were some of the state’s biggest political spenders from the business industry, including the California Chamber of Commerce and various landlord, banking and building associations. In total, those groups have given at least $13.7 million to legislators since 2015.
Wahab said in a written statement that landlords’ “money still speaks the loudest,” despite tenant advocates who represent millions.“Companies that benefit from keeping protections weak for tenants have billions of dollars to fund an army of lobbyists in the Capitol every single day,” she said. “That same machine mobilizes at the drop of a hat to pump millions into elections – even in districts during the legislative process – to scare and intimidate policymakers into voting their way, shaping the playing field long before a bill even gets a hearing.”
During the hearing, Kalra urged his colleagues to remember that just because renters are less politically active than landlords, lawmakers should not forget their plight.
“They don’t show up to your community coffees; they don’t have time to send letters in,” he told his committee moments before its members killed Wahab’s bill. “They’re trying to survive, and I think we need to also have that in the front of our mind as we consider these kinds of policies.”
The legislative session hasn’t been a complete bust for tenant-minded lawmakers – or for Wahab. Her Senate Bill 681, which includes new tax credits for renters, was tucked into a budget-related housing bill the governor signed Monday.
The advocates pushing for Wahab’s eviction relief measure also hope it comes back later this session, which is a possibility – albeit a slim one – since members of the judiciary committee voted to grant the proposal “reconsideration,” meaning it can be resurrected later if lawmakers choose. They almost never do.

It’s hard to shake the feeling that half the nation is, along with Trump, relishing scenes of Los Angeles suffering.","Los Angeles approaches Fourth of July weekend wounded and anxious. 
One of its more questionable traditions — nightly explosions of illegal fireworks in residential neighborhoods beginning around Memorial Day, ostensibly to practice for the big night — have been noticeably quieter than in past years. Perhaps it’s because the January fires that killed 30 people and wiped out much of Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and adjacent areas have dampened the local taste for sparks and combustion.
But it’s not just the fireworks. Independence Day parades, parties and other celebrations have been canceled or postponed in one community after another: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, Cudahy, Bell Gardens, Rowland Heights, Huntington Park, Whittier. In those cities and neighborhoods, each with sizable populations of immigrant families from Latin American countries, many people who otherwise would be waving American flags along parade routes and lining up for grilled hot dogs are avoiding public places for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents as they continue their campaign of arrests.
Across the region, once-crowded swap meets are desolate, taco and raspado carts are abandoned, Home Depot parking lots — where homeowners routinely hired day laborers on the spot — are empty.
It’s in some sense a reverse of the spring of 2020, when coronavirus lockdowns cleared freeways, offices, schools, churches, courthouses, restaurants, beaches, parks. The difference is that five years ago a swath of the population kept coming to work, notwithstanding the health risk, to continue delivering the food, mowing the lawns, cleaning the houses and watching the kids for those with the means to follow the stay-at-home orders. Now some of those same essential workers are the ones in hiding, not from COVID-19 germs, but from immigration agents masking their faces, covering their badge numbers, removing their license plates and sometimes arresting U.S. citizens as well as lawful asylum seekers and refugees. 
Federalized National Guard troops and U.S. Marines are deployed but don’t actually patrol the streets, and in fact they are rather hard to find. But the point is, they are here, part of Trump’s do-over of another 2020 episode. Perhaps he wishes he had sent the Marines into Minneapolis, Portland and Seattle during the George Floyd protests. Perhaps he sees Los Angeles in 2025 as his second chance. He has hinted at sending troops into every city governed by Democrats.
This city has seen more than its share of natural and human-made disasters, but to see Marines deployed against illegal entrants before now, you’d have to turn to the movies. In 2011’s “Battle: Los Angeles,” American audiences got two things they seem to crave: Scenes of L.A. being destroyed, followed by Marines destroying aliens. 
It’s a rich genre. Martians blew up L.A. City Hall in the 1953 version of “War of the Worlds” before being felled by a COVID-like microbe (the Marines, in this one, did not prevail). In 1996, aliens obliterated the Marines’ air station at El Toro and the Library Tower in downtown L.A. before being destroyed by a Marine and a cable TV guy in “Independence Day,” a movie that no doubt will be televised this week, as it is every Fourth of July. 
Trump’s policies treat gardeners, dishwashers and others as though they were those kinds of aliens. Invaders, rather than Angelenos and an essential part of the local economy, as well as neighbors, friends, family. The sweeps and round-ups are real injuries to real people, real traumas to communities, and not some summer blockbuster. 
Still, consider one more L.A. movie. There is a scene in “E.T. the Extraterrestrial” in which federal agents surreptitiously monitor a suburban San Fernando Valley home and then invade, with no warrant and with identities obscured and faces covered. The message is clear — the feds are the real aliens.
That’s how it feels in Los Angeles. Yes, we are a nation of laws, but must they be enforced with such contempt, such heartlessness?

Who will rebuild Altadena? What will become of the local workforce and customer base? Who will cook the food and wash the cars? Who will take care of all those homes and yards in the neighborhoods depicted in ET, and then who, in the next neighborhood over, will raise their kids to be engineers and U.S. senators, as Alex Padilla was? And when they are in the Capitol, will their dignity, and ours, be demeaned and assaulted as Padilla’s was?
Trump responded to the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires by lecturing us that we had it coming, for reasons that are indecipherable or just fictional — we didn’t rake the forests, we didn’t turn the spigot on the half-pipe. He said he would withhold disaster relief unless we do something about illegal immigrants who cast illegal votes, although there’s no evidence for any of that nonsense.

Yet he is targeting, along with a slice of our population, our efforts to limit the emissions that heat the globe and lead to drought, flooding, wildfire and other climate disasters — not just here, but from North Carolina and Kentucky to Hawaii and around the world.
And on Monday, his administration sued Los Angeles, claiming its policies to steer clear of federal immigration enforcement was the cause of rioting that accompanied protests against the sweeps.
The twin assaults — January and June, nature and nativism, fire and fear — nip at L.A.’s soul. It’s hard to shake the feeling that half the nation is, along with Trump, relishing scenes of Los Angeles suffering. 
On this particular Fourth of July, it’s a challenge to gin up much enthusiasm for hosting the nations of the world next year in World Cup soccer. Same with the 2028 Olympics, which so far generates little of the anticipation leading up to the 1984 games, when L.A. reveled in its self-discovery as a multicultural city of the future. Both looming events now feel eerily like they are meant to be capstones on Trump’s drive to subdue the city. 
Los Angeles is resilient, and will eventually recover its spirit, as it has many times before.

Operators of mental health support lines are laying off staff and ceasing or curtailing services due to California budget cuts and a 2024 ballot measure.


Phone lines that provide mental health support to tens of thousands of Californians say they are on the verge of shutting down or dramatically scaling back as a result of cuts in the state’s new budget. 
Representatives from the support lines, which are distinct from hotlines that serve people in crisis, say they help thousands of Californians with mental health needs each month.
And with more people than ever calling or texting for help, they say, the so-called warm lines are falling victim to both the budget shortfall and, in some cases, the roll out of Proposition 1, a 2024 ballot measure that redirected some tax revenue from mental health services toward housing.
“We save lives every day,” said Dr. Lisa Pion-Berlin, chief executive of Parents Anonymous, whose California Parents & Youth Helpline serves about 24,000 people a year. “Without that safety net there, where are people going to go?”
Pion-Berlin said the organization had requested $3 million a year from the state; the budget Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week didn’t provide any of it. Layoffs have already begun.
The landscape of state-funded mental health services has been shifting in California. In 2022, the state rolled out 988, a free mental health crisis line that has a dedicated funding stream and is not dependent on the state general fund. Then, last year, the state launched free mental health apps for youth and families through private companies Soluna and Brightline. 
But organizations that operate the phone support lines argue their services are different, and critical, in a state still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, the Los Angeles fires and a political climate targeting transgender people and immigrants. 
Antonia Rios, a mother of seven in Pomona, said she reaches out to the Parents’ Anonymous Helpline between four and seven times a week. Rios lives with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, addiction and PTSD from years of trauma and abuse in the foster care system. Prior to finding the helpline, she said, she often felt judged or cut short when she tried calling other places.
“The helpline was a safe haven for me,” she said. “It saved my life on many occasions.”
The helpline has also provided her friends and family with life-saving support on many occasions, she said.  “It breaks my heart they want to cut it.”
The San Francisco Peer Run Warm Line, which serves people all over the state, managed to hold onto $5 million this budget year. That still marks a significant drop from the $10 million a year they received previously and the $15 million they had requested. 
H.D. Palmer, the Department of Finance spokesperson, said that because the previous funding was one-time and due to sunset last month, there is technically no reduction in funding for the support line.
Meanwhile, the support line’s numbers have been spiking in recent months. This spring, they received about 40,000 calls a month; with their new, smaller budget, they anticipate connecting with the same number of people in an entire year.
Mark Salzar, chief executive of the nonprofit that operates the support line, said the group also runs a Spanish-speaking line that will now need to be shut down. 
In addition, it provides infrastructure support, training and technical assistance to a variety of other warm lines serving Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian and Black communities. The San Francisco Peer Run Warm Line is also the exclusive operator of a statewide service that Gov. Newsom has promoted, called CalHOPE, which targets young people and families on digital platforms. 
“With the budget cuts we’re not sure where these folks are going to go, honestly,” he said.
Amy Durham, chief executive of the Orange County chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said her warm line fields 900 calls a day and provides support to the sheriff’s department and local hospitals. 
She now has to lay off 127 people, many of them former warm line callers who never worked in the past and were now thriving as peer counselors.
She said she’s trying to rally donors to help keep some semblance of a warm line operating, even if hours would be scaled back.
“Now we’re going to wait until everyone’s in crisis,” she said. “I can’t imagine it’s cost effective or humane.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070125-988-Help-Line-MG-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

He was exonerated in February and awarded more than $2.7 million in compensation. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A Baltimore City man who was wrongly convicted of a murder nearly three decades ago will receive almost $3 million from the state — compensation for 27 years locked in prison for a crime he did not commit.
The Board of Public Works unanimously approved the payment Wednesday — and offered a public apology — to James Langhorne, who was exonerated in February in the 1996 death of Lawrence Jones.
Langhorne, in comments to the board, said the compensation is welcome, but that more should be done to help those trying to reenter society after decades behind bars.
“There’s not a lot of resources for people in our situation,” said Langhorne, who said he felt ill-prepared for his abrupt release. “You come home different from people who are generally released. You’re just let out. There’s no preparation.
“You didn’t even really know you were getting released. The moment comes up, they realize that you really didn’t commit the crime. They file something. You go to court and you just come home,” he said.
But years in prison meant Langhorne — and other exonerees — are released with no savings, no credit, no insurance or other support.
  James Langhorne said that he and others who are released after being exonerated are often retraumatized after being abruptly released with no preparation for life outside. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“You come out exonerated but you’re facing so many difficulties,” he said. “I’ve known of people who were exonerated who couldn’t maintain and now they’re back in prison for crimes they did commit. So that in itself is a travesty.”
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) recounted her meeting with Langhorne, in which he described going to prison for a crime he did not commit as “a trauma” and being retraumatized by being released without preparation or assistance.
Miller, chairing the board meeting  Wednesday in place of Gov. Wes Moore (D), told Langhorne she was “really sorry to hear you were faced with a situation” where assistance “wasn’t waiting for you as we should have been.”
“Your comments that you shared with me are noted and I assure you we will follow up on behalf of the state,” she said.
The settlement approved by the board includes compensation for the time Langhorne spent in prison as well as housing costs and attorney’s fees.
The payments follow funding formulas established in the Walter Lomax Act, a 2021 law named for a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent nearly four decades in prison. Under the law, compensation for proven or pardoned wrongful incarceration is determined by the length of time served and the state’s median income.
Currently, that formula sets the payment at $101,652 annually, or more than $2.7 million for the 27 years Langhorne served.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
People can also get housing, vocational training and health care. The board approval included $99,720 in housing assistance for Langhorne from the state Department of Housing and Community Development and a nearly $4,700 payment to Flowers Keller LLP, the law firm that represented him.
“Nearly three decades were stolen from Mr. Langhorne, depriving him of the opportunity to pursue a career, to build a family, to contribute to our state,” Miller said.
Langhorne was arrested in 1996 and charged with the murder of Lawrence Jones. He was convicted in Baltimore City two years later despite several problems in the case against him, including witness testimony that was either unreliable or conflicting. Another witness recanted their account and prosecutors were found to have withheld information about other potential suspects.
That conviction was vacated in February after a review of the case by the conviction integrity unit of the Baltimore City Office of the State’s Attorney. Langhorne had spent 9,870 days in prison by that time.
Langhorne said he has attempted to move past his wrongful conviction.
“It’s wonderful to hear people say how sorry they are for what we went through. I myself, I don’t hold you at fault. I understand that things go wrong,” Langhorne said. “Yes, I am angry at those who violated their trust as public servants to go above and beyond to ruin a man’s life, a father’s life, to obtain a conviction, so that is what I am angry at. But to be angry overall serves no purpose. That’s something you have to let go.”
  Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) apologized to Langhorne and said the state should do more to help those who are wrongfully convicted to rejoin society. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
Miller, in her apology to Langhorne, added “there are no words to express how deeply sorry we are for what was taken from him and for the failure of our justice system.”
“And again, while no amount of money can raise the injustice you face over the time that was stolen from you, I hope today’s action by the sport provides meaningful support, healing and comfort as you step into the next chapter of your life. May peace be with you.
While the money paid to Langhorne and his attorneys comes entirely from the state, that is about to change. The state budget that took effect Tuesday includes a requirement that jurisdictions where someone was found to have been erroneously convicted have to share equally in the cost of compensation.
Because Langhorne’s case before an administrative law judge was finalized and sent to the board before July 1, however, Baltimore City will not have to pay any of the costs.
‘Discrepancy’ adds $25 million to software contract
The board also unanimously approved — with little discussion — a request to amend a software purchase that increases the cost to the state by 63%.
Two years ago, the board approved a contract to license software valued at more than $40.4 million. The contract piggybacked off a deal by the city of Mesa, Arizona.
Documents filed with the Board of Public Works said that problems with internal financial systems used by the Department of General Services and the Maryland Department of Transportation led to “financial discrepancies” in the cost of the contract. The problem resulted in an additional $18.1 million in retroactive costs and another $7.5 million for the contract that runs through the end of September.
“While DGS and MDOT have not yet been able to resolve these challenges due to technical limitations of the FMIS system, both agencies are aware of the situation and are working towards a resolution,” according to information provided to the board by the Department of General Services. “We will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps as appropriate to help ensure these matters are resolved.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0485-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 09:05:41.845781

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The federal funding for several public school programs was scheduled to come by Tuesday. But this week instead of money, states received a notice saying that the $6.8 billion allocated for different K-12 programs were on hold and under review. 
Now, a network of summer care and after-school programs in Utah, funded by the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Grants, is under an existential threat, and the families of 10,000 children in 83 Utah programs could potentially lose their plans not only for educational opportunities, but also for child care for working parents.
The grants approved by Congress are typically distributed in April or May each year to fund high-in-demand programs offered in public and charter schools, as well as other community centers such as libraries and faith-based institutions. 
But the Trump administration is still studying whether these school programs align with other presidential initiatives, said Ben Trentelman, executive director at Utah Afterschool Network.
“Programs depend on that funding in order to be able to operate, and so if they can’t bill the state for reimbursement, these programs are unsure of exactly how long they’re going to be able to operate,” Trentelman said on Wednesday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

The programs may use registration fees or other means to pay for a portion of their operating costs up front. While there is other funding for the after-school and summer services, federal money is the top source, Trentelman said, accounting for over $6 million. Currently, there’s no state investment for the program.
“This enables programs to be able to operate at a higher capacity, to have higher ratios with the number of staff that they have in the number of youth that they’re able to serve,” he added. 
The Utah State Board of Education, which administers the funds locally, notified program managers they can continue using any remaining funds through August. But there’s no guarantee of funding after that, Trentelman said. At this point, most programs have already spent most of their budget for the 2024 fiscal year.
Some administrators may decide to take the risk to continue to pay for programs hoping for later reimbursements, he said. But, some smaller ones, especially in rural communities, may not have enough reserves to do that, and may have to decide whether to continue operating at all.
Because the Trump administration didn’t provide a timeline of when schools may hear more about the funding status, Anna Thomas, policy director at Voices for Utah Children, foresees that if the funds don’t get released soon, many Utah children will get kicked out of their summer programs within weeks.
“Our after-school programs in Utah are already tragically underfunded. If we were willing to serve every child that wanted to be served, our programs would be eight or nine times as large as they are right now. The only restraint on that is funding. The funding creates all the restraints,” Thomas said. “So these programs are already used to paying their staff next to nothing. They are already operating on a shoestring. They are already accepting donations in kind support from community partners.”

For the state, stopping them would represent a big employment and education disturbance, Thomas said. And without them, Utah families with school-aged children will see “incredible disruptions and stress” and other ripple effects.  
Looking at the potential repercussions, Thomas said she is, at best, disappointed by the funding freeze and the lack of consideration on its effects on communities across the county.
“When did we get to the point where kids having a safe, educational place to be in the summer with access to food that they might not get at home is somehow political? It’s not political, it’s humanitarian, it’s community service,” Thomas said. “We are leaving these families out in the cold on purpose, knowing fully how hard it will be on them in the immediate moment and how much difficulty it will create for all of us in the future.”
The programs are increasingly popular in Utah
One of the programs’ goals is to ensure that children have access to a safe place to go and to get meals outside of school hours. For many, they are a way to get their children involved in  free activities like fine arts, sports, computer science, or college and career readiness, among others.
The activities have grown especially popular over the years. For every child in a Utah after-school program, there are eight more waiting to get in, according to a survey from Afterschool Alliance. 
“These programs are actually very intentional in making sure that they’re aware of what trends are for growth in our workplace, making sure that we’re gearing kids up for whatever future opportunities may be,” Trentelman said. 
They have even partnered with different universities to mentor students interested in engineering or medical careers.
For some families, it is also a way to keep their kids out of trouble while parents are away.
“These programs operate typically between 2 and 6 p.m., when working parents are typically unavailable, and kids are also found to be engaging in riskiest behaviors at those times,” Trentelman said. “During those hours is when we typically see the highest rates of youth that are engaged in things like experimenting with drugs and alcohol, getting involved in gang activity.”

A federal court Wednesday heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by UA system professors and students against an anti-DEI law signed by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey last year. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a lawsuit alleging that anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) law signed by Gov. Kay Ivey last year violates the constitutional rights of professors and students.
The lawsuit, brought by professors and students in the University of Alabama System against Gov. Kay Ivey and the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, alleges that SB 129 stifled instructional activity and violated the First and Fourteenth amendment rights of the plaintiffs. 
A two-day evidentiary hearing was held last week. SB 129 bans public funding of DEI and the teaching of so-called “divisive concepts,” such as people of one race are “inherently responsible” for past crimes committed by members of that race. Critics say the legislation was vaguely written and threatened the teaching of Black history in schools.

Antonio Ingram, counsel for the plaintiffs, began oral arguments Wednesday by arguing that SB 129 prevents debates from happening in the classroom and prevents students from learning, citing as an example a course that could bring up the idea of paying reparations to Black Americans for centuries of slavery, segregation and voting disenfranchisement.
“Let’s say you’re in that reparations course, can a professor now not divide the class into two and have people take different positions?” Ingram asked.
Ingram specifically mentioned a project Cassandra Simon, a social work professor at the University of Alabama, had students complete for a grade involving a sit-in objecting to SB 129 which was cancelled while other protests on the campus were permitted by the college.
U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor, who is presiding over the case, said there could have been an “opt out provision” in place because it wasn’t clear if all of the students in the class agreed on the topic or not.
“Didn’t the administration give Dr. Simon feedback on how you can avoid that?” Proctor asked Ingram. “You can have opt out options, you can have students do a different protest.”
Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the UA Board of Trustees, said some students could have been pressured to do the sit-in protest that was canceled.
“Where I would disagree and do disagree with Dr. Simon, is I don’t think that appreciates the pressure of the majority of students in class and the minority of students in class,” he said.
The professors in the University of Alabama system have a “credible fear of enforcement” of the law because of student complaints and investigations that have been conducted by the universities on their professors, Ingram said.
He cited testimony from Dana Patton, a political science professor and director of the Witt Fellows Program at UA, who said she was investigated over the books she assigned for her courses and due to not wanting to be investigated again, she is now afraid to teach certain topics.
Proctor pushed back, saying there was no adverse action taken against Patton and that there is always going to be a potential for student complaints.
Dan Cantor, another counsel member for the plaintiffs, argued on behalf of the students who had been affected by SB 129.
Cantor clarified statements made during Sydney Testman’s, a former financial coordination for the UAB Social Justice Advisory Council (SJAC), testimony last week stating that not only did the SJAC lose $10,000 and their University Funded Organization Status, but Testman also lost her $600 stipend due to her role as a financial coordinator being dissolved due to SB 129.
Cantor also said in court that while SJAC could have still applied to be a Registered Student Organization (RSO), it would have only been $100 the organization could receive and this funding was not secure.
The attorney also cited testimony from UAB employee Mary Wallace, who said  some RSOs cannot get funding because of the University of Alabama Birmingham’s guidance following the passing of SB 129 which states that the institution cannot provide funding for “DEI related organizations.”
Cantor also provided clarification on testimony from UAB student Miguel Luna, who testified last week that his organization, Esperanza, lost funding due to SB 129. The attorney said Wednesday Esperanza also lost funding when SJAC did due to Esperanza using funding from SJAC to host events.
Counsel for Ivey did agree with the plaintiffs that Testman suffered due to the removal of her stipend, but argued Luna’s claim wasn’t reasonable because it’s more difficult to determine.
Cantor said the UA chapter of the NAACP has also been negatively impacted by SB 129 due to the closure of the Black Student Union and Safe Zone spaces which were used by multiple members of the organization. He argued these two spaces were closed due to UA assuming they would violate the bill because of the vague wording.
“UA doesn’t have to provide space, but once they do, they can’t discriminate based on viewpoint,” Cantor said.
The UA chapter of the NAACP is worried it might be completely shut down due to SB 129 according to Cantor. He said the organization is at risk of not receiving funding and they aren’t able to recruit members and leaders because of the BSU space being closed.
In their presentation, lawyers for Gov. Ivey argued that the professors are not advocating to teach divisive concepts, but instead are worried about student complaints and not actual enforcement.
Defense for Ivey also said the language in the bill isn’t vague and certain topics like political and social science need limits.
“You can always talk yourself into thinking a statute is vague,” counsel said.
Proctor is still indicating that he wants to decide whether an injunction should be issued before classes start in August. He also told both sides to discuss institutional neutrality and implementations to be on the same page. Cross briefings are set to start in three weeks.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tuscaloosa_McLelland16755-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541
,California,2025-07-03 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Presidential election reveals big shift in California voting patterns. Will it last?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/presidential-election-shift-california-voting/,Kamala Harris' poorer than expected performance with key demographic groups and increases in young voters registering Republican are signs of political change in California.,"For the last eight months, ever since Donald Trump walloped Kamala Harris to reclaim the presidency, Democratic politicians, political interest groups and media pundits of all stripes have debated what happened and why.
Deep dives into who voted, and sometimes why, have generally concluded that Harris lost decisive ground — compared to Joe Biden’s 2000 unseating of Trump — among younger male voters, especially Latinos and Blacks, and could not generate enough support among other demographic groups, such as women, to offset the losses.
“Overall, Harris performed six points worse among men than Biden did,” an extensive analysis by the Cook Political Report declared. “But that falloff was significantly more pronounced among Latino men (-12) and Black men (-7). Among white men without a college degree — a group that is traditionally the least friendly to Democrats — the slippage was least dramatic (-3).
“Despite the historic nature of her candidacy as the first woman of color to be nominated for president, women greeted that fact with more of a shrug,” Cook continued. “Harris’ vote share among women was basically the same as the share Biden got in 2020, except for a noticeable decline in support from Latinas. She also slightly underperformed Biden among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women (-4) and failed to do any better with Black women than Biden did.”
California, one of the nation’s bluest states, was not immune to the political hemmorhage that doomed Harris’ campaign, even though she is a Californian who was the state’s attorney general and a U.S. senator before becoming Biden’s vice president.
Voters in 10 California counties which had backed Biden against Trump in 2000, switched to Trump last year, and a new analysis of California’s vote indicates that the state saw the same dynamics as the nation as a whole.
“After years of declining shares of registered voters selecting Republican as their party registration, young Californians have begun to move towards the Republican party in recent election years while older Californians continue to move away,” the analysis by the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California declares.
 “Young registered voters of all racial and ethnic groups saw notably larger shifts towards the Republican party compared to their older counterparts. Latino youth, however, saw particularly large growth in Republican party registration between presidential elections.”
It continued, “While Vice President Kamala Harris received 58.5% of all votes cast in California’s 2024 general election, President Donald Trump received 38.3% of the votes, the smallest difference in the vote by party (20.2 percentage points) since before 2008.”
While Republicans obviously gained ground in California last year — and did reasonably well in congressional and legislative elections — the new data generate two questions: Why did it happen, and what does it bode for the future?
“Inflation is probably the biggest thing,” Eric McGhee, a political analyst for the Public Policy Institute of California, said during a webinar to introduce the study.
That comports with the widespread belief that sharp increases in the cost of living during the Biden-Harris administration were a big factor in the pro-Trump shift, as younger voters felt the pinch of inflation more than their elders.
Make no mistake. California is still a very blue state. It’s highly unlikely that Republicans, who were once dominant themselves, would regain enough ground to again award the state’s electoral votes to a GOP presidential candidate in the foreseeable future.
However, were the rightward surge of young voters of color to continue, for whatever reason, as baby boomer Democrats exit the political stage, California politics could become a lot less predictable and a lot healthier.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110624-President-Donald-Trump-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

But that hasn't made watching the debate any less worrisome.","Transgender advocates say that the cost to provide gender affirming care under Medicaid is small, but meaningful for those who need that care.(File photo by Amy-Xiaoshi DePaola/Cronkite News)As Congress wrangles over a budget reconciliation bill that would deny federal funds to pay for gender-affirming care, Lee Blinder appreciates the fact that they live in Maryland, which would likely cover any federal shortfall if it came to it.
But that hasn’t made watching the debate any less worrisome, said Blinder, the executive director for Trans Maryland.
“There’s the practical impact — and then there’s the emotional impact,” Blinder said. “The emotional impact of watching elected officials, and those who are in these positions of authority over our lives, attempt to eliminate people’s access to life-saving care is a stressful process — the emotional devastation that occurs when you see your government making these steps to try to eliminate your access to basic care.”
Blinder’s remarks come as Congress is engaged in an on-again, off-again debate over transgender care funding as it fights over the budget reconciliation bill, a massive combination of tax and budget cuts that President Donald Trump has called the one, big beautiful bill. The measure would extend tax cuts, increase defense and homeland security spending, and slash spending on Medicaid and food assistance programs.
The House also included a provision to prohibit the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care, when the House originally sent the bill over to the Senate last month. That provision had been stripped out by the time the Senate sent its version of the 1,000-page bill back to the House this week, thus allowing federal funds for such care — not because senators had a change of heart, but because the Senate parliamentarian said that keeping the ban in the bill would require more than a simple majority for approval.
So far, the bill has passed by one-vote margins in both the House and Senate.

The bill stalled briefly in the House this week, when fiscal hawks complained about the cost of the bill, which could add as much as $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. But among their problems with the bill was the fact that it would again allow federal funds for gender-affirming care.
“It’s an extraordinarily stressful time for transgender Marylanders,” said Blinder, who says there should not be a “poor tax” for transgender people who can’t afford gender-affirming care.
Unlike other states that have worked to restrict access to that medical care, Blinder noted that Maryland lawmakers have worked to protect gender-affirming care for some 24,000 transgender Marylanders.
In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D) approved the Trans Health Equity Act which says Maryland Medicaid “shall” cover gender-affirming care, granting lower income Marylanders access those procedures that they may not otherwise have been able to afford.
The state currently receives federal dollars to support those services. But under the Trans Health Equity Act, the state is expected to fund gender-affirming care, with or without federal support.
The Maryland Department of Health reports that in 2024, Maryland Medicaid spent $1.7 million to fund more than 1,600 unique office visits for gender-affirming care services. That figure currently includes about $900,000 in federal funding. A health department spokesperson said that the federal match for gender-affirming care “varies by eligibility group but is generally a 50% match.”
Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), said that it’s a cost that Maryland could probably absorb if federal funding was lost.
“It’s not insignificant … but the state could cover it,” he said.
Last week, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the General Assembly would likely have tried to backfill those dollars, among other cuts, “whatever we can and however we can.”
“Medical decisions are best made between a patient and their doctor,” he said. “I believe that in the state of Maryland, we protect people’s right to privacy and their relationship with their doctor, and we are covering medical care that is appropriately determined between that patient and their doctor. “

But Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) said that it’s not the size of the missing dollars that matters but the message toward the transgender community.
“It wouldn’t even make a small, teeny tiny dent in the question of our budget, which should tell you everything you need to know about what they’re actually doing here,” Fair said.
“The amount of money that’s spent on gender-affirming care is a pebble in an ocean of money.” he said. “People are trying to politicize a community that is simply trying to live and survive.”
While it was a “sigh of relief” when the gender-affirming care prohibition was cut from the Senate version of the bill, significantly increasing the chance that federal funds could still be used, Fair noted that the transgender community will still be affected by other provisions of the legislation, such as major cuts to Medicaid funding that could knock thousands of Marylanders off their health care coverage.
“If it goes through the way the Senate has passed that, the impact is still going to be deeply felt by the trans community, by other LGBTQ+ people, just because of the disproportionate percentages of people that rely on Medicaid,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/08-sex-cape-full-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the original House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which includes Maryland. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is currently in the House, where it has stalled briefly on procedural votes. Legislative leaders had hoped to pass the bill and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature by July Fourth.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
Rural hospitals, SNAP cuts, Medicaid: Democrats force tough votes on GOP megabill

“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.
“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.

“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version: States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Photo: Ronda Churchill for Nevada Current)Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is warning Nevadans that President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cut bill will ripple through every aspect of the state’s health care system, going far beyond those who directly rely on Medicaid.
Hospitals are already assessing whether they may need to cut staff or reduce services, said Cortez Masto during a Wednesday virtual roundtable with representatives from University Medical Center, Nevada Hospital Association, and Northern Nevada HOPES to discuss the legislation. 
They all agreed such cuts would have a cascading effect on anyone needing medical treatment.
Lee derides Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts: ‘People will lose their health care’

That is on top of the direct impact of the proposed Medicaid cuts, which providers have warned will result in delayed care, lost access to lifesaving medical treatments and possible closures of facilities.
“It is going to devastate health care in Nevada,” Cortez Masto said.
The House is expected to vote on the amended version of “Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. Cortez Masto and the entire Senate Democratic caucus voted against the bill, as did three Republican senators.
Among the GOP-backed megabill’s various provisions are $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years.
“All of this is happening so that Republicans and President Trump can pay for billions of dollars in tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans,” Cortez Masto said.
The legislation is estimated to kick around 17 million Americans off Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage, with about 114,500 Nevadans at risk of losing their health care, she said.
Among the nearly 738,000 enrolled in Medicaid in Nevada, 39% are children and 15% have chronic conditions, according to KFF. 
Nevada has a long history of low Medicaid reimbursement rates for healthcare providers.
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

In 2023, Nevada’s private hospitals agreed to pay what’s known as a “provider tax” that funds Medicaid and helps the state access additional federal matching dollars.
The current rate brings Nevada around $830 million each year.
That would change if the bill is passed. According to Nevada Hospital Association President Pat Kelly, payment amounts would be reduced “by about 30%, starting in 2028,” resulting in a reduction of around $618 million in funding annually.
“When you get to this low level, the program may need to be terminated by about January 1, 2030 to avoid major cash flow risks for our acute care hospitals,” Kelly said. “We agreed to pay 15% of the provider fee money to support behavioral health care services, and that will get cut as well.”
Because of many last-minute changes to the bill that were introduced in a 27-hour voting session, Kelly said the association is still assessing just “how devastating the impact is going to be to the provider fee program.”
Beatrice Nortey, a pediatric nurse who relies on Medicaid to treat her sickle cell disease, said these cuts go beyond numbers.
Many of the children in her care rely on Medicaid to pay for the oxygen tanks, suction tubes, and mobility devices.  
These “items that aren’t optional but necessary to keep them alive and out of the hospital,” she said. “When Medicaid is cut, these children face delays or denials in getting equipment they need, which can lead to unnecessary suffering, emergency room visits and even death.”
 ‘Ultimately gets paid by taxpayers’

Nevada has long faced a shortage of health care providers and consistently “ranks near the bottom nationally for primary care doctors and mental health care professionals per capita,” said Dr. Ketan Patel, the medical director of UMC.
The bill, he said, would make those deficits even more pronounced.
“When Medicaid gets cut, reimbursement rates drop,” Patel said. “That drives even more doctors to opt out of seeing these patients entirely.”
Jennifer Wakem, the CFO of UMC, said around 42% of patients that come in for inpatient care rely on Medicaid.
“To stay afloat financially, it would mean we potentially would cut services offered,” Wakem said. “If we chose not to go down that path, we would likely reach out to” Clark County “for additional subsidies to keep UMC open. That, of course, ultimately gets paid by taxpayers.”
The bill will likely hurt people who use private insurance. 
In a strained health system, those individuals would likely see premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar, Cortez Masto said, adding that Nevadans receiving coverage through the Affordable Care Act “could see premiums rise by $705 per year.”
“More people now are going to be showing up in our emergency rooms with acute care because they now have lost the health care that they need to even provide preventative care for them,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UMC_RC_002.JPG-ronda-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

Photo by Patrick Donnelly/Center for Biological Diversity.A conservation group is suing the federal government for delaying its decision on whether to list a rare wetland wildflower that grows in Nevada and California as an endangered or threatened species.
The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, alleges the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act when the agency failed to issue a timely 12-month finding on a petition to list the Tecopa bird’s beak, as required by federal law.
“The agency’s failure to meet the deadline delays crucial, lifesaving protections for Tecopa bird’s beak, increasing its risk of extinction,” the lawsuit reads.
The Tecopa bird’s beak is a rare wildflower that is only known to grow at three alkali wetland sites in western Nevada and eastern California. The plant has pink to pale lavender flowers and relies entirely on shallow groundwater that feeds wetlands in Nevada’s Esmeralda and Nye counties, and California’s Inyo County.
According to the lawsuit, the rare wildflower faces threats from groundwater pumping for agricultural use, geothermal energy development, mining, utility-scale solar development, and residential sprawl.
“As a groundwater-dependent species in the nation’s driest state, the Tecopa bird’s beak is uniquely vulnerable to extinction and needs to be protected,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The Fish and Wildlife Service has delayed long enough.”
The conservation group filed a petition to list the wildflower under the Endangered Species Act in October 2024, kicking off a yearlong review after the agency signaled the wildflower could potentially qualify for federal protections. 
Groundwater levels in Esmeralda County’s Fish Lake Valley, where the rare wildflower grows, have steadily declined due to overpumping. If the groundwater continues to decline, the Tecopa bird’s beak could face extinction, said Donnelly. 
The aquifer under Fish Lake Valley feeding the groundwater-dependent wetland ecosystem is heavily over-appropriated, meaning more water is taken out of it than goes into it each year. The aquifer’s water level has dropped two feet a year, the overuse drawing it down 75 feet since the 1960s.
Most of that water has been used to grow alfalfa in the region, a water-intensive crop that primarily feeds cattle in the beef and dairy industries, according to state documents.
The entirety of the plant’s habitat in Fish Lake Valley is allocated for solar energy development under the Bureau of Land Management’s Western Solar Plan, exposing it to development pressures, according to the lawsuit.
“As groundwater levels decline the species will experience reduced vigor, reduced reproductive capacity, and eventually population declines or extirpation,” reads the lawsuit.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RSTecopa-birds-beak-Esmerelda-County-Patrick-Donnelly-FPWC-lpr-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

It's been transformational.","This story was originally published by The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence in America. Sign up for its newsletters here.
On a rainy day in early May, a COMPASS Youth Collaborative van cruises down Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. The thoroughfare, with its historical ties to the Colt firearms family, is an epicenter for gun violence in the city. From the driver’s seat, Diego Lopez, a Peacebuilder with the violence interruption nonprofit, points out the invisible borders that define life and death for the city’s young people. 
This is the territory of 420 GMS, a loosely organized street crew. A few streets over, it’s the Latin Kings, and further down, Los Solidos — a street gang formed in Hartford in the 1990s that’s experiencing a resurgence today, Lopez says. The groups form fault lines in a landscape dotted with persistent poverty and frequent violence, where teenagers have access to Glocks with switches for automatic fire or assault-style pistols equipped with drum magazines.
Hartford isn’t known nationally as a hotspot of gun violence, but it has one of the highest rates in Connecticut. Though its homicide rate declined from a high of 32 per 100,000 residents in 2022 to 18 in 2024, its rate is still roughly three times the national average. 
“Our worst enemy out here is the high-volume weapons — war weapons,” Lopez, a former Latin Kings member and four-time gunshot survivor who completed a 16-year prison sentence before becoming a violence interrupter more than a decade ago, tells me. “We’re talking young people as young as 14 or 15 years old having access to this stuff. These kids don’t even got access to PlayStations.”
In this high-stakes environment, interrupting violence requires more than just good intentions. It demands precision, consistency, and information. For the team at COMPASS, their most powerful weapon isn’t worn on a vest or carried in a holster. It’s an app on their phone.
It’s called Navi.
COMPASS was established three decades ago — during the early days of widespread internet adoption. For years, the vital work of COMPASS’s violence interrupters, case managers, mentors, and social workers was a whirlwind of paper notes, binders, and memory. A Peacebuilder might have 25 young people on their caseload, each with a complex web of needs, rivalries, court hearings, and appointments. Tracking it all was a nightmare. 
That changed in 2021 when COMPASS decided to build its own case management solution. The organization came up with Navi, a custom, secure, mobile-first platform designed by the Peacebuilders themselves and engineered with the help of a contractor. “I was begging for this for maybe 12 years,” Lopez recalled. He even won an internal competition to name the app.
“If you’re in the middle of a crisis, paperwork becomes the last thing you want to do because you have to go sit down and write,” Jacquelyn Santiago Nazario, the organization’s CEO, said. “Here it’s just, click. There’s less room for error.” The goal was a system that was easy to use on the go, secure and HIPAA-compliant to protect a vulnerable population, and most importantly, useful.
Today, Navi is the digital backbone of COMPASS’s entire operation. It’s a real-time intelligence hub that transforms how Peacebuilders engage with young people at risk of being involved in violence, giving the violence interrupters access to live data wherever they are.
“It’s amazing,” Lopez said. “It tells me everything I need to know in real time. If there’s an update put in there five minutes ago, I’ll be able to go in there and see it.”
This real-time data is the key to navigating often dangerous social dynamics of the street. Before engaging a young person or bringing them to COMPASS’s youth center, a Peacebuilder can check Navi. A “red” safety assessment may, for example, signal an active conflict between the young person and another participant. 
In other words, the app prevents potential eruptions of violence — creating another layer of safety for both Peacebuilders and the young people they work with.
“I’ll be able to look at all youth safety assessments and know if they can be together or not,” Lopez said. “Those are being updated on a constant basis.”
The platform is more than a conflict web or network analysis. It’s a comprehensive support system. Peacebuilders log every interaction, from a missed phone call to a deep conversation on a street corner, contributing to nearly 2,800 notes entered into Navi each month. It helps the Peacebuilders, social workers, and other staff ensure the participants are actually getting what they need.
Peacebuilders can submit “basic needs requests” — say, for a participant who needs deodorant or clean clothes for a job interview — which are immediately routed to a program coordinator who makes sure the need is met. They track “major life events,” both positive and negative. The system then alerts the entire team to provide collective support when a youth is arrested or experiences the death of a loved one, or to celebrate when they land a job. In the end, Navi helps them track participants’ readiness and skills they’ve learned from the organization’s use of cognitive behavioral interventions, education, and support.
Navi also helped COMPASS realize that they needed more Peacebuilders and to reduce the caseload of each person from 25 participants down to between 15 and 18. “We’re high-touch,” said Ayelet Chozick, the director of organizational advancement. “We’d like our Peacebuilders to see you three times a week. We were seeing that they were not being able to see all these kids in this amount of time, and we made the strategic decision to get the funding to add more.”
That data-driven approach helps the team to be relentlessly consistent, Diamond Cooper Jenkins, a COMPASS Peacebuilder, told me. For young people who have been repeatedly let down by the systems and adults in their lives, having a reliable “someone” may be what finally breaks through.
“It’s all about accessibility,” Jenkins said. “If they try to call us, and we don’t come through, then you’re building barriers. If you say you’re going to be there for them, you’ve got to follow through.”
The Navi data doesn’t replace the human touch or the lived experience that defines what credible messengers do, but it does empower the work. It allows the Peacebuilders to focus their energy on building relationships, knowing that logistical details are managed and essential information is logged.
Navi also helps COMPASS comprehensively track the efficacy of their programming, a barrier other grassroots anti-violence programs often struggle with. It’s showing promising results.
According to that data, 79 percent of their roughly 200 participants saw a reduction in their risk levels, and 73 percent reduced their engagement in violence. The recidivism rate for participants under 18 — most of whom have already faced the criminal legal system before they got involved with COMPASS — is just 26 percent, compared to the Connecticut state average of more than 70 percent. For young adults in the program, it’s 20 percent versus the state’s 55 percent. 
In addition to its Peacebuilder street-based outreach program, COMPASS’s hospital-based violence intervention program, which responds to every violent injury of a person under 25 in Hartford, has seen more than 95 percent of its clients avoid returning to the hospital with complications from their original injury and avoid revictimization.
COMPASS’s approach could serve as a model for other violence intervention programs. Santiago Nazario said the organization is exploring ways to share the lessons it’s learned from Navi — and possibly the platform itself — with other organizations.
Their work to prevent violence not only saves lives but also taxpayer dollars. It costs about $12,000 a year to put a participant through the COMPASS program, Chozick said. The cost to incarcerate one person in Connecticut runs over $60,000 a year.
Yet the ground is shifting beneath them. Federal funding for community violence intervention and prevention programs has been slashed since President Donald Trump took office in January, leaving organizations like COMPASS in a precarious position as they await word on whether their grants will be affected. One of the organization’s federal grants is set to expire in September, and after the Trump administration’s cuts, fewer new grants are opening up that COMPASS could apply for.
“To see this work getting cut is devastating,” Santiago Nazario said. “What happens when we can’t serve more kids, or we don’t have enough to support the kids that we have?”
Back in the van, Lopez pulls up to a curb to meet a young man who has experienced a catalogue of challenges, including the loss of two best friends in separate, traumatic events. The losses, less than two years apart, threw him off, he said, and he found himself involved with the wrong people. 
When the Peacebuilders first approached him, the now 18-year-old was skeptical. But their relentless outreach — though it sometimes verged on annoying — eventually won him over.
“They helped me,” he told me. “Two years ago, I really couldn’t see where I would be in the future. Now, a year later, I already know what I’m going to be doing. I already got plans set out.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/thumbnail_image001-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 08:04:57.481541

(Photo by Kate Horne)There’s a tradition that when someone sings Handel’s “Hallelujah Chorus,” everyone has to stand. So please rise as I warble several heartfelt hallelujahs over what the Manatee County Commission did last week.
The headline in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune tells only half the story: “Manatee County commissioners deny development of hundreds of homes in Parrish.”
Missing words from this summary include “in a flood-prone area.” Also missing: “Wetlands were going to be wiped out” and, most surprisingly, “The developer is one of the most politically powerful people in the state.”
Oh, and, “The commissioners were unanimous in rejecting it.”
  Developer Pat Neal via his website
Of course, the developer, former state senator Pat Neal, told the Herald-Tribune he plans to fight the decision: “Standby. This is not over.” I picture him singing this like King George III in “Hamilton” telling the rebellious Americans, “You’ll be back!”
We’ve seen a lot of discouraging environmental news lately. Gov. Ron DeSantis has decided that reviving his national political profile by building a detention center with a catchy nickname is more important than saving the Everglades. He also vetoed money to tear down the old Rodman Dam and restore the Ocklawaha River. Meanwhile, the Legislature slashed the funding for buying more land to preserve it.
In so dark a world, a move like Manatee County’s shines like a rare beacon of hope.
“The board’s denial … is the first time commissioners have outright denied a project pitched by one of the region’s most prominent developers,” the Herald-Tribune reported.
Here’s how it happened: “A few of us strangers who are neighbors banded together; that’s what made it possible,” one of them told me this week.
 ‘Make me an offer’
Neal’s Linkedin page says he’s been the CEO of Neal Communities since 1970, which is a loooooong time to be doing just one thing. He’s built 25,000 homes so far.
He’s also taken control of a lot of land. In 2014, the Bradenton Herald reported that Neal was trying to snap up as much ranch and farmland as he could to convert it to residential and commercial buildings, regardless of size, location, or zoning.
“If you have land, we want it,” Neal told the paper. “You can even put my personal cellphone number in the newspaper. Make me an offer.”
Forbes magazine ran a more recent profile of Neal noting the current economic slowdown. The headline said, “He made a billion building bouses for Florida’s ‘Marvelous Middle.’ Now things aren’t so marvelous.”
Yes, you read that right. The business magazine estimates Neal’s company, Neal Communities, is worth $1.2 billion-with-a-b.
He hasn’t been shy about sharing his wealth with quite a few political entities. In just the last three years he’s donated $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party and $45,000 to Senate President Ben Albritton — ironic, considering Albritton claims to be a champion of the state’s remaining rural areas.
His biggest contribution of all, $200,000, went to a PAC named Better Roads for Florida that’s — surprise! — headed by an executive of Neal Communities. I wonder if he just moved the money from his left pants pocket to his right one.
Because of his generosity, when Neal wants something, he usually gets it.
For instance, he wanted this year’s Legislature to block local governments from making any changes in their development codes that would better protect people from hurricane damage. With Senate Bill 180, he got what he wanted. Gov. DeSantis, apparently feeling he hadn’t done enough horrible things to our state this week, signed it into law on Monday.
Like the Wizard of Oz, though, Neal prefers not to be seen pulling the levers of power. He deploys a cadre of consultants to speak for him. In April, when he made a rare personal appearance at a Manatee County Commission meeting to talk about more road construction as a solution to developer-caused traffic congestion, he admitted it was his first time standing before the board since 1979.
He didn’t show up in person to push Porter Ranch. Instead, the petitioner was one of Neal’s companies, this one named SimplyDwell, which had requested a rezoning of 217 acres of agricultural land.
SimplyDwell would use that rural land to build a new subdivision of 440 homes. But the board said a word Neal seldom hears: No.
“The county commission is correct to reject Pat Neal’s proposal to build in a flood zone,” Glenn Compton of the venerable environmental group ManaSota-88 told me. “It’s encouraging to see locally elected officials place the public’s interest ahead of a developer’s profits, something that rarely happens.”
 Parrish is perishing
Parrish is an old farming community, named for a pioneer rancher named Crawford Parrish. Like a lot of Florida farming communities in recent years, parts of it have been smacked by sprawl.
Cows got moved out as developers moved in, building 1,000-home subdivisions. Out went the pastures, in came the pickleball courts and dog parks. Longtime residents fear their quiet, old Parrish is perishing.
The previous version of the county commission threw their door open wide to allow in all of that change. They approved every developer request, no matter how damaging to its neighbors.
They even voted 6-1 to get rid of the county’s strict wetlands protections, despite how important wetlands are for flood control and groundwater recharge.
Voters could see what was going on. Many had turned out to oppose the wetlands rollback, only to see their commissioners ignore their wishes and kowtow to developers.
Meanwhile, all the new development made their traffic and stormwater problems much worse, especially when Hurricane Debby hit last August.
  Ariel Lowe via screengrab
“My whole house had a moat,” recalled Ariel Lowe, whose Parrish property backs up to the site of the Pope Ranch development. She keeps goats, chickens, and other livestock: “My animals looked like they needed snorkels.”
The Pope Ranch property fared about the same as she did, she told me: “Where they were trying to build got saturated from being totally flooded.”
The neighbors could all picture Neal’s development pushing the floodwaters off the Pope Ranch property and onto their own.
  Abbey Tyrna via Suncoast Waterkeeper
After the storm, “there was a flooding forum and I was a part of that,” said Abbey Tyrna, executive director of the environmental group Suncoast Waterkeeper. “A lot of the people who showed up seemed surprised to see that they weren’t alone.”
The forum, organized in part by the East Manatee Preservation Association, drew a packed house, said other participants. County officials at the forum acknowledged that much of their floodplain data are outdated and obsolete, which was far from comforting.
Tyrna told me her main message to the forum attendees was how important wetlands are for soaking up flooding. Get rid of them and the flooding is bound to get worse.
  Kate Horne via screengrab
Another of the neighbors of Pope Ranch, Kate Horne, told me that they’ve already lost too many wetlands because “the previous commission just approved everything.” She could tell the loss of wetlands has gone too far because “I’ve had flooding on days when we had no rain.”
 Snow in Florida
Whenever I have questions about Manatee County, I call up former commissioner Joe McClash, who publishes the Bradenton Times. He told me the unpopularity of the wetlands rollback, followed by the flooding, helped doom the pro-development county commission.
Then, making the voters even angrier, DeSantis appointed one of the pro-developer county commissioners to be the new supervisor of elections, despite having zero experience at running elections.
  Joe McClash via Manatee County
McClash joked that DeSantis, by removing one of the commissioners, deserves the credit for allowing the voters to flip a majority of the commission seats during the fall election. So did the decision by the most pro-development incumbent to run against the lone anti-sprawl commissioner  –  and then he lost.
Suddenly, there was a new commission majority — still all Republicans, but for a change willing to listen to their constituents. The new commissioners were talking about imposing a one-year development moratorium and requiring developers to pay much more in impact fees.
The developers, not accustomed to such independence, made noises about not negotiating.
“They told me it would have to snow in Florida before I could get the builders to come and see me,” one of the new commissioners said.
Meanwhile, when the commissioners tried to restore the wetlands rules that had been in place before, they were slammed against the hall lockers. The bullies were four, count ’em, FOUR state agencies that answer to DeSantis, each one questioning whether being so protective of wetlands could possibly be legal.
“This is bat s*** crazy,” one of the newer commissioners said in disbelief.
This should give you a good idea of why the commissioners reacted the way they did to seeing the proposal from Neal to build more than 400 new homes at Pope Ranch.
The ranch, by the way, is in a designated Coastal High Hazard Area. And the plans called for destroying wetlands to make room for the entrance and exit roads, Lowe told me.
If the plans had been approved, Lowe said, she knew what would happen during the next flood. The roads in and out would have been underwater.
“He would’ve left everybody in that development landlocked,” she said.
 Selling swampland
To speak for this unpopular project, Neal dispatched a platoon of planners, consultants, and engineers, plus his longtime attorney, Ed Vogler. Vogler insisted that the development wouldn’t make the region’s flooding worse.
“We sympathize, we empathize, we understand” the objections of the neighbors, he told commissioners during a May meeting. He said Neal was willing to take “extraordinary measures” to deal with the flooding, adding, “We can’t solve the historical problems, but we can make it better.”
  Mark Van De Ree via screengrab
Nobody bought it, though. One opponent, Mark Van De Ree, joked, “I’ve lived in Southwest Florida almost my whole life, but I didn’t know we were still selling swampland to Yankees.”
Indeed, Tyrna pointed out to me that the Porter Ranch plans submitted to the county showed no buffers along Gamble Creek, the source of much of the flooding. Instead, she said, “they showed some Adirondack chairs lining the creek.”
Those chairs look nice, but they don’t do much to soak up floodwaters.
Because Neal was asking the county for a rezoning, that made it easier for the commissioners to tell him no, McClash said.
The developer knew that land was zoned for agriculture when he bought it. There was no legal guarantee that he would be able to change the zoning to build a subdivision.
That’s something for other counties to bear in mind when destructive projects like this come up. Given how the governor and Legislature have tied their hands to keep them from restricting development, the smart thing to do is to stick to what’s in their growth and zoning plans. Don’t let builders build in places that have been deemed inappropriate.
Another is to focus on the needed infrastructure, such as roads, stormwater ponds, and sewage lines. Urge your county to require those facilities be built upfront.
“We know we can’t stop development, but we can slow it down long enough to get everything in place,” said Lowe.
Several people mentioned to me the importance of networking for pulling the neighbors together to fight damaging development. Whether meeting in person or virtually over social media, connect the community so they can all rise up together.
Another piece of advice: Stick to what the evidence shows.
“We can’t fight with emotion,” Horne told me. “We have to fight with facts.”
If you live in another part of Florida that’s being inundated by a flood of poorly planned development, follow these steps in shoring up your defenses.
Then, if you succeed in saving your slice of paradise, feel free to cut loose with a whole chorus of hallelujahs. I promise that when you do, I’ll stand up, and so will everyone else who really cares about our state.

The vital lifeline for tens of millions of Americans everywhere — including 161,841 people in Vermont — used for housing, groceries, gas, and other everyday necessities is about to mark its 90th birthday.
And with that anniversary comes a responsibility to strengthen the program — and find ways to help it age in the healthiest way. As the foundation of retirement in America, our financial future depends on protecting Social Security for decades to come.
Social Security will face challenges in the years ahead, but it’s our responsibility to make sure the program continues to serve the 67 million Americans who depend on it. 
The history of the program shows how vital it is for Americans’ secure retirement. On Aug. 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, and in January 1935, Ida May Fuller, the first person to receive Social Security (and a Vermonter!), collected a monthly check of $22.54 — that’s $518.58 in inflation-adjusted dollars.
From that start, the program now provides $1.4 trillion in retirement security. It is the only inflation-adjusted retirement program, giving Americans confidence to plan their retirements. That’s nationwide.
Nearly one in four (161,841) Vermont residents collect Social Security benefits, and 42,000 Vermonters are lifted out of poverty every month. Social Security helps Vermonters live and retire with dignity, offers crucial support to those with disabilities, and serves as a financial lifeline for families navigating the loss of a loved one.
Social Security will never “go broke.” That’s a fact. Social Security operates as a pay-as-you-go system. As long as workers continue to contribute, there will be Social Security for those collecting.
Funded by payroll taxes, the program will keep paying beneficiaries. However, it does face funding challenges. The latest Social Security Trustees’ Report indicates that the surplus will be exhausted by 2035. To prevent that shortfall, Congress must again take action — just as it did during the 1983 reform — before millions of Americans are left with less than they’ve earned.
Customer service is another area where Social Security is facing challenges. Administrative chaos at the Social Security Administration this year has contributed to a customer service crisis that has been ongoing for years.
SSA has struggled with call wait times, hold times, customer service resolutions and staffing issues, according to SSA’s own data. Many Americans who need access to the program face hours on the phone or in line at their local offices. And budget and staffing levels have strained SSA’s ability to provide vital services.
This year, wait times are increasing, fewer people can reach a Social Security representative to get assistance, and this issue arises just as about 10,000 people retire every day.
The new Social Security Commissioner would be well served by re-committing the Social Security Administration to providing timely, efficient and effective customer service. SSA needs to be clear when communicating any possible changes and what effects lower staffing levels will have. And Congress needs to provide oversight to ensure that customer service is prioritized at an agency that has struggled to serve Americans everywhere.
Throughout our history at AARP, we have worked with every Administration and Congress, regardless of party, to protect and strengthen Social Security. More than 67 million Americans rely on this vital program, and for 90 years, Social Security has been the foundation of retirement in the United States.
It’s imperative to ensure the strength of this Social Security not just for another 90 years, but for generations upon generations to come.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bossange: Moving forward in Vermont after June 14.","This commentary is by John Bossange of South Burlington. He is a retired middle school principal and a board member of Better (not bigger) Vermont.


Like many Vermonters, I’ve been waving my American flag and holding signs at various locations in demonstrations against the authoritarian rule of President Trump. I’ve been at the Statehouse in Montpelier, at City Hall in Burlington and most recently along Route 7 in South Burlington to show my resistance to the president, and his MAGA cabinet, close advisors and supporters.
My friends and I were encouraged by the large turnout for the June 14 rally held at Waterfront Park in Burlington but left the demonstration with mixed feelings and confusion over the focus and purpose of this important demonstration.
When we first arrived there were mostly American flags flying with a variety of signs expressing what the “No Kings” meant to them. That was expected and good to see.

But once the rally began there were as many Mexican flags as there were American flags. After the welcoming introductions, speeches and protest songs were sung in Spanish with dancing and Mexican flags waving on the stage. For 45 minutes I felt I was in Mexico or at a migrant justice rally. That was unexpected!
From there, the presenters on stage turned the demonstration into a Palestinian rights rally with Palestinian flags and speakers who have experienced the brutality of ICE, and the oppressive violation of our First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. I began to wonder when there would be Ukrainian speakers on stage also using this platform to rally the crowd around their specific concerns.
These and many others are all important causes, and it was good to see people voicing their opinions and demanding their rights. I am in support of all of them.
But the rally was billed as “No Kings” to focus on Trump, who wants to rule like an authoritarian. For too much of the time, the demonstration did not feel like that, and for me and my friends, the rally lost its intended focus. We left early.
There are so many issues which impact most citizens that the “king” is taking away from all of us like Medicare, Social Security, public education, a free press, free speech, not addressing the climate crisis, or budgeting that does not include a fair tax policy. Speakers, no matter their cause, should have been instructed to address these topics to unify each group under one common cause: Trump’s assault on the Bill of Rights, and his attempt to rule like a king and change the face of America.  
Instead, the day felt like an identity protest rally. Just as the big-tent Democrats have become a floundering and splintered identity party with no focused lens for action, the small tent Progressives have become an ideological party who see the world primarily through their own narrow lens. Both are failing to unite the country, and here in Vermont where our Progressive Party is often as strong as the Democratic Party, the division is even more evident. In Burlington on June 14, indivisible we were not.
The June 14 rally at Waterfront Park, organized primarily by Indivisible Burlington, was symbolic of the lack of unity between legitimate causes and unfortunately illustrated our ineffectiveness in dissent, resistance and protest when measured against a unified, stronger and much more focused MAGA party. Indivisible, they are.
In comparison, I had friends who attended rallies in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia, and the photos they sent me showed mostly American flags. They said the speeches were centered on President Trump, his executive orders, and his authoritarian rule. There were flags representing multiple causes, but the focus was on the president and his king-like behavior.
I fear the Waterfront Park rally could easily make Burlington a poster city and Vermont a poster state for the MAGA party to use against us, and for their dominant media networks that are always busy looking for ways to distract others from our “No Kings” message.
At the same time, they will have an easier time trashing our collective resistance by only focusing on our failed identity politics and splintered individual group causes, and not on the most important issue of a dictator wannabe.
Organizers at Indivisible Burlington and elsewhere need to put on their “political smart hat,” and be sure that future rallies stay focused on what’s happening in D.C. that will eventually impact all of us, not just identity groups. We need leadership to keep all of us in the same lane.
Those with specific issues, no matter how passionate they feel, now more than ever, need to see the big picture. To have a real impact moving forward, indivisible we must be.

The latest move has renewed worries from advocates that the information could be used for immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump ups the pressure for more deportations.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture filed a notice in the Federal Register about creating a new database of information from states and the third-party payment processors that help the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program run. 
The agency wants states’ data on SNAP participants and transactions. This follows Trump’s executive orders seeking to get data from state programs that receive federal funding and to stop that money from going to immigrants without legal status.
The Department of Agriculture plans to use the database to “ensure the integrity of Government programs, including by verifying SNAP recipient eligibility against federally maintained databases, identifying and eliminating duplicate enrollments, and performing additional eligibility and program integrity checks,” according to the Federal Register notice.
Records shared would include names, social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses.
The Trump administration has made strides in recent months to obtain state-level data that could be used to target immigrants without legal status. Washington and other states this week sued the White House over sharing personal data of Medicaid recipients with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“This administration is looking for a lot of data that it shouldn’t have,” said Claire Lane, director of the Seattle-based Anti-Hunger and Nutrition Coalition.
To apply for SNAP, applicants must give names and demographic information for the other people who live in their household, but they can omit information for family members not eligible, like immigrants without legal status.
“We want to make sure that people have confidence that when they ask for help, they’re not going to get in trouble, and other people they care about aren’t going to get in trouble,” Lane said. “The chilling effect is real, and we want to make sure that people aren’t going hungry because of fear.”
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the program serves upward of 42 million people.
The federal government funds SNAP, which helps low-income residents pay for food with monthly benefits loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, cards. States run the program, with the assistance of third-party processors.
Washington also provides state-funded food assistance to legal resident immigrants who aren’t eligible for SNAP benefits.
The Trump administration is already in hot water over a request in May for states and their processors to hand over personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants going back five years. The agriculture department backed off after nonprofits and others sued over privacy and presidential overreach concerns.
Washington’s processor, Fidelity Information Services, had told its state clients it planned to cooperate with the Trump administration. But the state’s Department of Social and Health Services, which runs SNAP here, told Fidelity not to share Washington data. Other states similarly did not comply.
The department specifically cites “verifying eligibility based on immigration status” as a rationale for the new database.
The agency, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, believes the system complies with federal privacy law.
Plans for the system opened for public comment last week.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Social and Health Services said the agency was drafting comments to send to the federal government, but declined to comment further.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snap-ebt-food-stamps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 07:01:58.243765

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released last week, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

In June media organizations, including The Associated Press, confirmed that the Trump administration had greenlit immigration officials obtaining personal data about individuals receiving Medicaid health coverage, including immigration statuses.
The lawsuit Nessel signed onto says that even though the Trump administration deported more than 140,000 U.S. residents in the first four months of this year, it’s understood that Trump is not satisfied with the number of deportations. With Trump’s own admission that he wants to deport millions of residents, the lawsuit said it’s expected that the administration will use the Medicaid data to accomplish that end.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Medicaid personal health care data is private and sharing information outside the purview of preserving public health and the Medicaid system is unlawful on multiple fronts including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which outlines protections for medical data. 
“Our personal healthcare data is exactly that: personal,” Nessel said in a news release Wednesday. “It should remain confidential and be accessible only to agencies directly involved with Medicaid. This unlawful move by the Trump Administration to grant access to unrelated entities will undoubtedly harm the health, privacy, and well-being of all Michiganders. I remain committed to protecting our privacy rights.”  
The news release from Nessel’s office outlines concern that through the Trump Administration’s actions there will be fear from Medicaid-eligible noncitizens and their loved ones that will keep them from enrolling.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Department of Environmental Management identified a handful of regulations that could clash with a gubernatorial order to eliminate “unduly burdensome” or costly rules, though nearly all of them appear to be relatively minor tweaks. 
Still, Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said Gov. Mike Braun’s mandate to review the agency seems like a decision that “environmental protections are bad for businesses before really, fully understanding and researching the issues.
“… we just need to keep in mind that protections are in place because, often, an event has occurred and we realized that the protections that were currently in place were not sufficient,” he continued. 
Indiana Senate approves sweeping administrative rulemaking overhaul

For example, Carpenter pointed to IDEM’s new recommendation to streamline the process for alternative thermal effluent limits. Carpenter said that those processes were established in response to a 1999 chemical spill that killed more than four million fish — something not acknowledged in the review. 
Just 14 facilities fall into this regulatory category, according to the state agency, but the process for meeting those water quality standards and getting approval “can be burdensome and create(s) uncertainty.”
The report recommended the agency revisit the guidelines.
The 17-page regulatory review, submitted by IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods and General Counsel William Anthony on July 1, stems from dual March 12 executive orders from Braun that targeted environmental justice and overregulation. While one focused on burdens and cost, the other sought to align the state’s rules with federal regulations. The latter report is due later this year. 
“IDEM is committed to ensuring that its regulatory actions are consistent with statutory authority, supported by the best available science, and not unduly burdensome,” read a July 1 letter in response to the governor’s mandate. “IDEM has identified several opportunities to clarify or rescind existing policies and regulations, and intends to complete the additional reviews identified above and submit additional reports…” 
The agency said it also hopes to collaborate with its federal counterparts to find ways to meet Braun’s orders. Another half dozen executive orders impact IDEM’s operations, including ones related to supporting coal generation and advancing nuclear development. 
Carpenter criticized the former for being a “more expensive … (and) dirtiest form of energy” that doesn’t meet sustainability or affordability goals set in state statute. 
“It’d be interesting to the pose the question to some of the utilities, ‘Would it be burdensome to you to keep open a coal plant that you had scheduled to close?’” posited David Van Gilder, the senior policy and legal director of the Hoosier Environmental Council. 
 More on the rules

In a Tuesday release, Braun painted his actions as business friendly, saying it would create jobs and economic growth while balancing “responsible environmental protection and stewardship.” 
“Government naturally drifts toward over-regulation, and it’s important to go through these regulations to make sure they aren’t stifling innovation and raising the cost of living for no benefit. My agencies have been directed to identify regulations that are raising the cost of living without benefiting our environment so they can be changed or rescinded; we can grow our economy while also safeguarding Hoosiers’ health and preserving our natural resources,” Braun said.










We need to unleash the productive side of our economy, while protecting and preserving our state’s natural resources.


– Gov. Mike Braun


But the report and environmental advocates noted that Indiana’s environmental regulations have been curtailed for decades, leaving little for IDEM to revisit or eliminate. 
Rescinding certain rules will be a lengthy process, the agency adds, because it will need approval from the Environmental Rules Board, a period of public comment and a regulatory analysis. 
At least two actions would need to go through the rule reversal process but may not need any federal approval, according to IDEM. 
Current state law requires resubmitting underground storage tank notification forms for any change — beyond federal rules surrounding ownership changes or new tank installations. If not properly maintained, such tanks can leak into their surrounding communities, contaminating the ground and nearby water sources. 
IDEM also wasn’t sure if eliminating or revising requirements for submitted emissions reduction plans following malfunctions would require federal approval. But this rule depends on the source, and thus could be modified to be less burdensome, the agency said. 
Just one change — allowing fire departments to conduct burns for training purposes without prior approval — would explicitly need the federal government to approve a revised state plan.
 Meshing state, federal requirements

The state agency did identify a handful of rules that wouldn’t require any federal action, such as streamlining the permit schedule for pollution discharge elimination and allowing “appropriate feedstock” only in permitting.
Rules for the first are inconsistent throughout the state, differing between water in the Great Lakes basin and downstate waters. Rather than having some areas with three-year schedules, IDEM recommends clarifying the state statute to allow for five-year schedules that align with the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Read the full report. 

As to the latter, current code requires a land application permit for appropriate feedstock waste but not for waste that’s a mix of appropriate feedstock and biomass — or only biomass — when it comes to certain classes of crops. 
Also in terms of permitting, solid and hazardous waste permits currently ranged from three to five years, but could be expanded to ten to “reduce paperwork burdens … and improve Indiana’s competitiveness.” The agency is already reviewing this as part of an unrelated review of its fees.
And while the federal government doesn’t dictate the state’s requirements for certain tax deductions, IDEM also noted that it didn’t have expertise in this area either. The agency determines if certain systems or devices qualify for tax deductions — an “unnecessary” requirement that officials say could be moved to another entity. 
The state division devoted to electronic waste registration and recycling is limited to the expenses of administering the associated fund, but state statute could expand that authority in a way that enhances collection activities, according to IDEM. 
The tenth and final recommendation would seek to codify some of IDEM’s policies.
The agency received thousands of public comments and included two dozen in the Tuesday report. 
“I’m really looking forward to seeing the release of those comments,” said Van Gilder. “It’s important that our elected officials represent us and those concerns and there is a lot of concern (around) having environmental protections in place.”
Carpenter added that he’d like to see unfiltered comments that weren’t “hand picked” for the report.
Though Braun railed against states with stricter environmental regulations than federal standards — saying he believed the nationwide requirements are an “appropriate baseline” — Indiana hasn’t been in that category in years.

Like many states, Indiana has “no more stringent than” laws that align the state’s rules with the federal government, including air and water quality protections — as reflected in IDEM’s report.
“… (IDEM) anticipates, based on prior review with related executive orders, that this universe of regulations is relatively small,” the accompanying letter summarized. “Indiana Code, as well as previous Gubernatorial administrations, have limited IDEM’s ability to promulgate rules that are more restrictive than federal regulations for decades.” 
Citing this, the state agency said it would identify specific federal rules requiring regulations that potentially clash with Braun’s order and work with the appropriate federal agencies to identify solutions. 
But the EPA has also been a target for criticism and deregulation at the federal level, meaning that their rules could change as well — triggering a potential ripple effect in Indiana.
“The fact that there is this significant push to roll back environmental protections on the federal level undermines the alignment that we current have,” said Carpenter. “It’s really important for the state to be independent and be able to make independent guidelines.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The $4 trillion GOP budget bill that squeaked through the U.S. Senate this week yesterday would “help usher in a golden age for American workers, farmers and families,” according to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Missouri.
One nonpartisan think tank disagrees, strongly. Energy Innovation says the bill will kill nearly 23,000 Minnesota jobs, slash state gross domestic product by $22 billion and raise household energy bills by $2.7 billion — a 28% increase — over the next decade.
The principal culprit: a rapid phaseout of federal tax credits for wind and solar power, which are cheaper and faster to build and operate than “baseload” gas, coal and nuclear power plants. Along with batteries, they account for the vast majority of recent additions to the U.S. grid.
“Minnesotans are struggling to pay the bills in the face of rising inflation,” Energy Innovation Senior Director of Modeling and Analysis Robbie Orvis said in a statement. “Congress has decided to kneecap utilities’ ability to build new generation to meet demand and impose billions in new energy costs on households and businesses.”
By damaging wind and solar, the Republican bill hands a win to fossil fuel industries, with whom President Donald Trump and the GOP are closely aligned. Oil and gas interests donated more than $75 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the Republican National Committee and other related committees. Trump told a gathering of oil and gas executives gathered at Mar-a-Lago last year that he’d give them their policy wish list in exchange for $1 billion in campaign donations, the Washington Post reported.  
Given the newly important role of wind, solar and other alternative power sources, the GOP bill would hamper development of new electricity generation. Energy Innovation says the GOP budget will slow power plant construction in Minnesota by nearly 25% over the next decade as the AI boom drives electricity demand growth to levels not seen since the early 2000s. Some grid experts believe that will increase the risk of power outages in the coming years; one Democratic lawmaker called the GOP budget “the Big Blackout Bill.”
Less supply and increasing demand almost always means higher prices for consumers. 
In a statement calling the bill “a huge step in the wrong direction,” Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota Executive Director Annie Levenson-Falk suggested utility service shutoffs could further increase from already-elevated levels.
“More than 91,000 Minnesota households had their utility service shut off for nonpayment last year,” the highest annual count by far in at least a decade, she said. 
As of March, Minnesota utility customers collectively were $150 million behind on their utility bills, adding to what Levenson-Falk characterized in a Wednesday interview as a multifaceted affordability crisis challenging lower-income folks.
“You’re seeing increasing divides between people who can pay their bills and those having trouble,” she said.
Energy Innovation’s modeling showed Minnesota industrial businesses would be even harder-hit by the GOP budget. They face a 46% increase in electricity bills by 2034.
Though Minnesota has not had a front-row seat for the manufacturing boom spurred by the Biden-era climate law that the GOP budget all but repeals, Energy Innovation’s modeling raised the specter of tens of thousands of job losses due to “decreased investments in clean energy projects…from lower demand for the inputs to those projects, and (indirect job losses) from lower induced economic activity.”
Those include jobs manufacturing high-efficiency appliances at local factories run by companies like Trane Technologies and Daikin; installing those appliances in homes and businesses; weatherizing existing buildings; and building new homes to modern efficiency standards. These employees, whose work helps Minnesotans save millions on their utility bills each year, account for three in four “clean energy” jobs statewide, said Gregg Mast, executive director of Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, in an interview Wednesday.
“The bill in its current form is certainly a job killer and is undermining one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy,” Mast said.
The small, independent installation businesses that dominate Minnesota’s growing solar sector will also suffer under the GOP budget, Mast said. Consumer demand will drop due to the loss of a tax credit for residential solar arrays, but perhaps even more significantly, contractors will face “the loss of a decade of certainty on the federal policy side,” he said.
Minnesota’s mandate to produce electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2040 is a faint silver lining in all of this, Orvis said in an interview Wednesday. 
Even without federal subsidies, Energy Innovation expects states like Minnesota to build more wind, solar and batteries than states without clean electricity mandates. That buildout will increasingly insulate ratepayers from volatile fossil fuel prices, which make up a significant portion of utility bills, Orvis said.
Still, “this bill makes electricity more expensive everywhere,” he said, pointing to a recent analysis by investment bank Jefferies that sees grid-scale solar farm construction nearly doubling in cost in the coming years.

As Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the budget bills passed by lawmakers this year, he vetoed $310 million in general revenue spending and issued a warning that the next budget won’t have any extra money.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” Kehoe’s news release stated.
The biggest portion of that shortfall will be in the Medicaid program, which became a prime target for cuts in the federal budget bill. According to KFF, Missouri could lose approximately 14% of its federal Medicaid funding over the next decade, or approximately $17 billion.
Part of that reduction is due to people leaving the program. An analysis prepared at Princeton University estimates that 130,000 of the 1.25 million people currently covered by Medicaid would lose coverage over the next 10 years. 
But a large part of the 10-year impact would be costs shifted to the state. Missouri would either have to replace those funds, cut the range of services offered or end coverage for tens of thousands of people. 
  Rep. Betsy Fogle, D-Springfield, speaks at a press conference Feb. 13, 2025 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
“The bill being debated is going to blow a hole in our budget that will be hard to recover from,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the Missouri House Budget Committee.
Missouri ended the 2025 fiscal year on Monday with a healthy $4.3 billion in the general revenue fund, plus another $1.3 billion that can be spent like general revenue. But the $50.8 billion budget for the current fiscal year consumes most of the money that can be spent like general revenue and about $2 billion more in general revenue than expected receipts.
Fogle said she opposed Kehoe’s vetoes and said worries about future spending needs should prompt him to veto a tax cut measure on his desk, which he has said he will sign.
“I do not understand why we are continuing to push that as a priority if the governor thinks he cannot pay his bills in future years,” Fogle said.
Missouri spends about $15 billion on Medicaid annually, but most of the money comes from the federal government. For every dollar from Missouri taxpayers, the state receives $1.80 to $9 of federal matching funds.
Missouri minimizes its use of general revenue in Medicaid by taxing hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes and ambulance providers.
Missouri was already facing a shortfall of funding for Medicaid in the next fiscal year. Lawmakers this year used $778 million remaining from federal COVID-19 health care support that will have to be replaced in future years to maintain the program.
The changes in federal policy include in the budget bill that will add to the direct costs on Missouri taxpayers are:

Lower federal match starting in federal fiscal year 2030 for adults ages 18 to 64 covered by the Medicaid expansion amendment passed by voters in 2020. The federal government currently covers 90% of the cost, pegged at $4.6 billion in the current budget.
A cap on how much provider taxes can contribute to state Medicaid costs starting in federal fiscal year 2028. The budget approved by Kehoe appropriates $1.1 billion from provider taxes.
Cost-sharing for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that is popularly known as food stamps. Starting in federal fiscal year 2028, Missouri would have to pick up a larger share of administrative costs, plus a portion of benefit costs based on the state’s payment error rate.

Some states have laws repealing participation in the Medicaid expansion program for working-age adults, enacted in 2010, if the federal government does not maintain its 90% cost share promise. Missouri must cover that group because it is in the state Constitution.
Missouri currently pays about 35% of the cost of covering about 900,000 people covered by traditional Medicaid.
Anyone who is enrolled now in the expansion group would be covered with a 90% federal share. For new enrollees after 2030, Missouri would have to pay 35% of the cost.
Every 10% of the total cost for Medicaid expansion shifted to Missouri would increase the cost for state taxpayers by about $460 million.
The cost of expansion could escalate quickly, said Timothy McBride, co-director of the Center for Health Economics and Policy in the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“The churning in that population is pretty high,” he said in an interview with The Independent.
The bill would impose an 80-hour-a-month work requirement for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.
The state will also have to verify eligibility every six months instead of annually.
“We’re going to lose some people who are not going to either be qualified because of the work requirements, or they’re going to just not fulfill paperwork requirements,” McBride said.
The Senate bill freezes provider taxes at their current levels and reduces them for the states that have expanded Medicaid.
The hospital provider tax is the largest of the four in Missouri, accounting for about $900 million of the total.
“We have been very consistent in our message that deep cuts to provider taxes will harm enrollees, access to care for all Missourians, hospitals and other providers, and the state’s budget,” said Dave Dillon, spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association. “We’re also committed to working with all partners at the state and federal level to minimize the harm if this framework is adopted.”
Current federal law caps the provider taxes at 6%. Starting in federal fiscal year 2028, the cap would be lowered by 0.5 percentage points a year — stopping at 3.5% — for the 41 states like Missouri that have expanded Medicaid coverage to working age adults.
Missouri House passes Medicaid provider tax bill, preventing major budget cuts

The current hospital tax rate for Missouri is 5%.
The second-largest provider tax is on nursing homes, but the reconciliation bill exempts the provider tax from cuts, said Nikki Strong, director of policy at the Missouri Health Care Association, the nursing home lobbying group.
The exemption helps, she said, but nursing homes are struggling to maintain adequate staffing and, in many cases in rural areas, are considering closing. Pressure on state revenue hurts the chances of getting increased rates, she said.
“From our perspective, any cuts that are going to impact general revenue in the budget, without replacement revenues, are not good at this point in time,” she said. “It is not going to benefit us.”
The SNAP program has been paid for exclusively from the federal treasury since it was launched in the 1960s. 
Under the bill, states will be required to contribute a percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. The U.S. Department of Agriculture counts benefit underpayments and overpayments as errors. 
Missouri’s error rate of 9.4% in 2024 would mean it would pick up about $160 million of the cost, plus an extra portion for administrative expenses.
“Missouri will struggle to pick up these costs,” said Amy Blouin, executive director of the Missouri Budget Project, “and state lawmakers will face extremely difficult choices, like whether to get rid of SNAP in Missouri, eliminate optional benefits like home- and community-based services that keep people living in their communities, or cut funding for services like education.”

(From Morales' official X account)Following months of scrutiny over millions in no-bid contracts, the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office has quietly started issuing formal requests for proposals (RFPs).
The move also comes on the heels of a new law adopted by the General Assembly earlier this year to increase transparency requirements around state contracting.
As of July, nearly a dozen RFPs were listed on the Secretary of State’s (SOS) ”contracting opportunities” webpage. They include requests for vendors to handle call center services, maintain and modernize cloud-hosted software platforms, and redesign division websites.
 Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales answers questions during a June 18, 2025 State Budget Committee meeting. (Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Most of the RFPs were posted in late May with submission deadlines in early to mid-July. 
One RFP calls for a third-party call center to manage tens of thousands of calls annually across the agency’s Business Services and Auto Dealer Services divisions, including responding to 6,500 to 11,000 monthly customer calls; escalating complex cases; and storing call recordings that include sensitive personal data. The vendor would be expected to meet daily performance benchmarks and provide regular reporting to the state, according to the RFP.
Multiple proposals also seek vendors to maintain and upgrade “critical” software systems that run key parts of the office’s work — ranging from business filings and notary applications to securities oversight. 
The office is requesting applications from firms with experience in cloud-based architecture, cybersecurity, workflow automation and artificial intelligence to help reengineer its existing tools and build new ones with an emphasis on performance and user accessibility.
Another RFP asks for help creating content for a redesigned INBiz portal, while others seek outside firms to evaluate and strengthen the office’s IT security protocols; develop website infrastructure; manage project compliance; and monitor contract execution. 
Morales defends previous no-bid contracts
The new listings follow reporting by the Indiana Capital Chronicle in December that revealed Secretary of State Diego Morales had awarded more than $3.3 million in contracts without a competitive bidding process. Some of those contracts went to politically connected vendors who gave tens of thousands of dollars to Morales’ reelection campaign.
Morales and his office have defended those arrangements, previously telling the Capital Chronicle that the agency “opted to pursue vendors with strong track records, and commercially competitive proposals in lieu of public bidding.”
Secretary of state spending includes millions in no-bid contracts

But during a June 18 State Budget Committee meeting, he faced further scrutiny from state lawmakers about the no-bid contracts — along with a myriad of other controversies — while seeking more than $10 million in funds for his office.
The other controversies included Morales’ purchase of a $90,000 car with taxpayer money from a campaign contributor and hiring his brother-in-law.
Morales emphasized that no-bid agreements were awarded by the secretary of state’s office before he was elected. He said they were legal — sometimes necessary, when on tight deadlines — and that under his watch, only “companies with experience” received contracts.
Even so, Republican Sen. Chris Garten pressed Morales on previous no-bid contracts awarded to companies that made campaign contributions, saying “Indiana constituents deserve to know” such details.
Morales held that “lots of people” donate to his political efforts.
“We’ve been following no-bid contracting that has been done for the past 20 years. I’m not doing anything different,” Morales said. “This let us look for companies that are experts in what they do … and they’re getting the job done … and we’re saving taxpayer money by hiring the best of the best in the business.”
New contracting expectations
Following passage of Senate Enrolled Act 5 — a new law that bans non-public, no-bid state contracts and increases oversight of agency spending — the secretary of state said the agency is overhauling its internal processes to ensure compliance.
Chief Legal Counsel Jerry Bonnet told the state budget committee that while the secretary of state’s office “historically (was) not bidding” contracts or IT work or other services, “they’re all now going up for the bid process.”
“We’re taking a considerable amount of time talking to vendors now,” Bonnet said. “So, we’ve embraced the emergency that was declared by Senate Bill 5 to start putting all these contracts out for public procurement.”

The bulk of the agency’s latest funding request, nearly $8.2 million, is earmarked for technology and security improvements.
Bonnet said a new chief information officer, who joined the office in 2023, assessed the IT systems and concluded that the “antiquated systems … (were) in danger of failing.” Improving that part of the office has created “a high spending curve” that Bonnet said would fall at the beginning of next year to between $4-5 million.
It’s not yet clear how much the new RFPs will be settled for, but Bonnet said the office has “already been able to negotiate discounts with some vendors.”
“The bidding process is great, but it takes quite a bit of time to then take something and pick it apart and do all those details, specifications, advertise it, talk to all the different vendors,” he added. “We’re trying to do more with less.”
Bonnet said the office is also seeking to contract with a consultant to help navigate and manage new requirements enacted under Senate Enrolled Act 5.
“Before we make any new contracts, we’re going to hopefully have a professional contractor … an independent expert, to make those contract assessments,” he noted. “It’ll be a rush, but we’ll be working in the coming weeks and months to try and keep our IT projects on track.”

(Courtesy of Idahoans United for Women and Families)The rallying calls were familiar.
Despite dangerous pregnancy complications, women are being denied emergency abortions. Doctors are leaving the state. And politicians shouldn’t be involved in sensitive health decisions. 
But one part of the pitch was new: Instead of asking state lawmakers for a fix, Idahoans can sign on to establish their own state law. 
“Idaho has been living under the trigger ban for nearly three years,” Melanie Folwell, lead organizer for the group behind Idaho’s abortion rights ballot initiative, told a Boise rally on Saturday. “And we have seen — and you’ll see in the stories you hear today — that it simply does not work for Idaho. It doesn’t work for anybody. So, today is the first step we are taking to end the ban.”
The effort to collect signatures for the proposed ballot initiative comes nearly three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That reversal lifted federal court protections for abortions, letting states regulate abortion — which activated trigger abortion bans in several states, including Idaho.
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. 
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote. 
But qualifying an initiative for the ballot is a tough hurdle in Idaho. 
In the past decade, only three ballot initiatives have had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot: a successful Medicaid expansion initiative in 2018, a failed historical horse racing initiative in 2018, and an unsuccessful primary election reform initiative in 2024. 
The group Folwell leads, Idahoans United for Women and Families, is hoping to qualify the abortion ballot initiative for the ballot in the November 2026 general election. That gives organizers about a year to collect the nearly 71,000 signatures needed. 
They already collected 1,200 signatures on Saturday, when hundreds of people turned out for the rally, organizers say. And organizers are gearing up for signature collection efforts across the state soon, Folwell told the Sun, helped by their 1,000 volunteers.

 Initiative could mean doctors won’t ‘be afraid to move to Idaho,’ doctor says

The initiative could mean doctors and other medical professionals “will not be afraid to move to Idaho and take care of us,” Dr. Becky Uranga, an Idaho doctor, said at the rally.
That could mean several things might get better, she explained between cheers from the audience — like your longtime doctor “will stay and keep caring for you and thousands of others,” that you may be able to avoid a six-month wait to see a doctor or other medical professional, and that Idaho doctors can “again provide the needed care without the risk of criminalization hanging over our heads.”
“And most of all, this could restore the sacred space between doctors and our patients. And I can honor all of your beliefs and privacy in the exam room — without any external pressures,” Uranga said. 
Kate Campbell-Covell, a pregnant mother with two kids, told the rally about how she had to travel to Utah after she learned her son wouldn’t survive her pregnancy. 
“With tears in their eyes, our extremely compassionate and loving medical team explained that due to the laws in Idaho, they were unable to render the care they deem necessary to save my life and protect my future fertility,” she said.
Then she was airlifted out of state, she said.

After federal court protections, St. Luke’s has said the health system hasn’t had to air transport any patients for pregnancy complications. Before those protections, St. Luke’s transported six patients out of state in the first four months of 2024. The federal court protections only allow emergency abortions for doctors at St. Luke’s.
Campbell-Covell later learned that she had a severe placenta infection. If left untreated, she would have died, she said.
She had her son’s ashes sent home.

For years, she worked in social work, and now works as a local therapist.
“The amount of children that I saw living in absolutely horrid conditions, and from individuals that were forced to bear them from other countries, is really what radicalized me and made me pro choice,” Doubleday said.
Ken Harris, a local musician, also signed. He said he wants abortion access in Idaho to return to how it used to be.
“That was what the case was in Idaho for 50 years. Male politicians — politicians have no business dictating to people about their private medical decisions and feelings,” Harris told the Sun. “A woman’s opinion about what she should do with her body — for her own health, for her family — should be her decision alone.”
 Signature gathering starts — after delay from redrafting state’s official descriptions

To qualify for the ballot, the group needs at least 70,725 qualifying signatures from Idaho registered voters. That figure is 6% of Idaho’s nearly 1.2 million registered voters in the 2024 general election — spread across half of the state’s 35 legislative districts.
But signature gathering efforts were delayed by almost six months after initiative organizers legally challenged descriptions state officials developed about the initiative for voters to see, Folwell told the Sun. The descriptions are featured on signature gathering forms.
Last month, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and the Idaho Division of Financial Management to redraft the descriptions.
The new short ballot title describes the initiative as a “measure creating right to abortion before fetus viability, and post-viability to protect health; right to privacy; healthcare provider liability protections.”
The initiative would raise state expenses by less than one thousandth of a percent of Idaho’s share of the Medicaid budget, or between $3,100 and $7,800 each year, the initiative’s redrafted fiscal impact statement says.
“This impact is derived from the costs of treating chemical abortion complications for women enrolled in Idaho’s Medicaid program,” the fiscal impact statement says. “Medicaid covers medically necessary services to treat complications from all abortions. It is anticipated that as legal abortions increase, the complications will also increase. This will likely result in an increase in Medicaid covered services and expenditures to treat complications from chemical abortions, which the State has reliable and readily available data to support.”
The new fiscal impact statement also no longer includes the entire Medicaid services budget of $850 million in fiscal year 2024.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gross assessed values for commercial, industrial and residential properties throughout Indiana collectively rose 12% from 2024 to 2025, according to a statewide comparison chart assembled by the Department of Local Government Finance for property taxes due and payable in 2026.
In comparison, gross assessed value grew 13.2% in 2022-23 and 8.9%.
The data is sourced from ratio studies performed annually by state’s 92 county assessors.
“It is essentially a test of each assessor: how well are you doing? Are you doing this right?” said Larry DeBoer, a retired Purdue University agricultural economics professor and tax expert.
  Purdue University emeritus professor Larry DeBoer on Sept. 30, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“Not very many … elected officials actually face a test like that. They’re being held accountable.”
Agricultural land, meanwhile, will be assessed at a lower base rate than the previous year, thanks to a provision in the behemoth tax plan Indiana lawmakers approved in April.
That’ll likely shift property tax burden toward other property types, DeBoer noted.
Local residential trends reemerge
Commercial assessed value grew 16.07% in total, according to the study, ahead of industrial assessed value, which increased 15.59%.
Values for Hoosier houses collectively rose by less: 10.42%.
Lawmakers have, for years, promised cash-strapped homeowners that high assessed values and resulting skyrocketing property tax bills would naturally come down.
“I think we’re seeing some evidence” that values are growing more slowly, DeBoer said.
Relief could be on the horizon at last.
Gross assessed values don’t translate perfectly to property tax bills, however. County auditors will apply all deductions and credits to certify net assessed values, according to DLGF spokeswoman Jenny Banks.
DeBoer also observed a bigger variety in residential value growth than in recent years.
“Covid was a nationwide trend that affected every place — so maybe we’re not seeing a big nationwide or even statewide trend affecting home values now,” he posited.
“We’re back to: assessed value is a local issue,” DeBoer added. “And a local economy, and the local assessing practice, is what seems to be influencing the changes.”
Tax bill eases pressure on farmland
Indiana’s farmland is assessed differently.
DLGF calculates a rolling average using six years of capitalized net operating income and net cash rent. The highest value of the six is dropped from the formula, and the remaining five years are averaged to determine a base rate.
Another increase was in the cards for the base rate, to $2,390 per acre.
That would’ve come after several straight years of big jumps: from $1,500 in assessment year 2022 to $1,900 in 2023 and $2,280 in 2024.
Lawmakers intervened via Senate Enrolled Act 1, increasing the capitalization rate in the formula’s denominator to lower the base rate. Now, it’ll be $2,120 per acre, according to a DLGF memo.
“Yep, that was a victory for the (Indiana) Farm Bureau,” DeBoer quipped.
The formula averages six years to “iron out the blips,” he said, but it also can create a delay where assessed values may keep rising even as farm incomes and commodity prices are falling. The last high pandemic-era value, for example, won’t drop out of the formula until the end of the decade.
The average price of top-quality farmland was $14,392 per acre in 2024, according to a Purdue University Farmland Values survey. Average- and poor-quality farmland prices averaged $11,630 and $9,071, respectively.

(Photo by Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)Oklahoma has a decision to make: Will we continue clinging to a pretrial system that punishes poverty and fails to deliver public safety? Or will we move toward a smarter, fairer, and actually effective alternative?
The evidence is mounting, and the verdict is clear: cash bail — the dollar amount a court determines you must pay to be released from jail before your trial — doesn’t work. It doesn’t improve court appearance rates, and it doesn’t make our communities safer. What it does is lock up thousands of legally innocent Oklahomans every year simply because they can’t afford to buy their freedom. Reform is long overdue.
A new study out of Tulsa County offers a case in point.
 The Bail Project, a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to low-income people nationwide while advocating for a system based on safety rather than wealth, tracked more than 3,300 individuals booked into the county jail over the course of a year. They found that those who received non-financial support — reminders, transportation, and service referrals — still showed up to court. In fact, people whom The Bail Project supported showed up to every hearing nearly twice as often as those who paid bail out of pocket, and 33% higher than those using a bail bond agent. And it didn’t cost them a dime.
So why does Oklahoma continue relying on a system that fails to deliver safety, fairness or accountability?
One answer: the commercial bail industry. The industry collects billions each year, including millions from struggling Oklahoma families. These nonrefundable fees — often 10% of the total bail amount — are gone for good, even if the court drops the charges or the person is found not guilty. It’s a predatory system that lines the pockets of a few while destabilizing many.
But it’s not just about economics, it’s about recognizing a broken and harmful system, and then fixing it. Oklahoma has one of the highest incarceration rates nationally and globally. Jailing people before trial for weeks or months — often for low-level, nonviolent offenses and sometimes unaffordable bail — has devastating consequences. In the Tulsa County study, nearly a third remained in jail until their case concluded, spending an average of 105 days behind bars. That’s more than three months of lost jobs, housing instability, and family separation, all before a court ruling. Despite a presumption of innocence, people who remain in jail are more likely to plead guilty, just to go home.
Consider the story of Nicole Rodgers, a 31-year-old Black medical social worker in Tulsa. She was wrongfully accused of armed robbery based on mistaken identity and faced a $50,000 bail she couldn’t afford. As a single mother of three, she risked losing her job, home and custody of her children. With help from The Bail Project and a public defender, the judge reduced her bail, she was released, and her case was later dismissed — but not before experiencing deep trauma. To this day, Nicole lives with anxiety and fear of rearrest.
In counties across Oklahoma, pretrial detention decisions are made based not on risk but on resources, and depending on your county, two people charged with the same offense can have vastly different outcomes. Nonviolent felony bond amounts ranged from $5,000 in Rogers County to $10,000 in Logan, Ellis, and Pushmataha counties.
Meanwhile, the public foots the bill. Tulsa County’s incarceration rate has ballooned nearly 200% since 1970, costing taxpayers more than $30 million a year.
There is a better way. Pretrial support services, like court reminders, transportation help, and voluntary referrals, are just as, if not more, effective than financial bail at ensuring return to court. These approaches cost less, preserve due process, and avoid the devastating ripple effects of unnecessary jail stays.
Oklahoma could consider limiting or eliminating cash bail for low-level and nonviolent offenses, investing in non-financial pretrial support systems, and using pretrial detention only when absolutely necessary, based on risk, not wealth. We can’t claim to uphold the presumption of innocence while routinely jailing people for being poor. We can’t talk about public safety while using a system that destabilizes families and communities.
The lesson from Tulsa is simple but urgent: the bail system is not doing its job.
Cash bail doesn’t keep Oklahoma safe — it just keeps people down.

The post Conservative Wyoming couldn’t stomach Republican public land sale appeared first on WyoFile .","Although Donald Trump won Wyoming by a wider margin than any other state in the 2024 presidential election, Equality State residents broke sharply from his party as Republicans sought to sell off 2-3 million acres of public land in the West.
Across a state that often supports and promotes conservative initiatives, there was scant support in recent weeks for the sell-off provision in the Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill. The Equality State opposed this GOP budget initiative with criticism from many angles.
That opposition came despite Utah Sen. Mike Lee repeatedly revising his “mandatory disposal” plan. The Republican chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that advanced the measure.
From a one-man logging operation in Cora to a high-grade compass and optics company in Riverton, individuals, businesses, advocacy groups and nonprofits knitted together a coalition that helped kill the sales.

“Not for sale!” hundreds of protesters yelled at the steps of the Capitol in Cheyenne a week ago.
“It’s one of the first times I’ve seen businesses and individuals come across party lines and unite,” said Addi Jenkins, executive director of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Business Alliance, a group that rallied against the sell-off. “It’s moving to see something still connects us all.”
Land mine
Lee proffered the plan as a solution to unaffordable housing — an issue many communities in the West are grappling with. Critics said it funded a tax break for the wealthy. Importantly, the sell-off would establish the practice of auctioning away unique assets belonging to all Americans, detractors said.
The Beehive State lawmaker, in the face of mounting resistance, reshaped his plan to squeeze through public roadblocks. Protected lands like national parks wouldn’t be touched, he said. He withdrew national forests from the list of eligible sale lands. He trimmed the plan to exclude all but Bureau of Land Management property within five miles of population centers.
But the idea still wouldn’t fly. “I think he stepped on a land mine,” said Buzz Hettick, co-chair of the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers.
Lee surrendered. His Appomattox Courthouse was X.
“I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he posted Saturday evening on the social media platform.
Opposition came from across the West. The land sale provision was “one of the only big-ticket issues everybody agrees with,” said Jess Moore, a musher who grew up surrounded by the Gros Ventre Mountains. She runs sled dogs there and along the Greys River, making a living on property belonging to all Americans.
Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of disparate organizations from the American Alpine Club to the Surfrider Foundation, said it generated more than half a million letters to lawmakers. “This victory is because of your voices,” Adam Cramer, the group’s CEO, said in a statement.
It’s clear, the group said, that senators “were responding to pressure from their constituents.”

Tribes were active. “Indian Country and our allies were paying attention, and we came together to shut it down,” said Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance Action Fund. The group gathered and sent 23,574 letters to the Senate asking that lawmakers reject the legislation, she said in a statement.
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity assembled 148 high-profile regional conservation groups who characterized Lee’s effort as deeply unpopular and reckless.
Hettick, flying back to Wyoming after a fishing trip to Alaska, sat next to two people who brought up Lee’s measure and criticized it. “To me, that says a lot,” he said, “that two random people on an airplane would say the same thing.”
Businesses on board
Jenkins’ Wyoming outdoor business group collected signatures from 85 businesses who called on Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to oppose Lee’s measure.
“I think this is a great example of issues that fire up and unite people,” said Taylor Phillips, owner of Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures, who signed Jenkins’ letter.
Threats to public land get “people off the couch and they’re willing to stand up and speak out,” said EcoTour guide Mark Gocke, who moved to Wyoming decades ago for the unencumbered outdoor access. “It’s not partisan,” he said of the sentiment.
In Sublette County, a crossroads of energy development and wild lands where Trump received 79% of the 2024 vote, elected officials stood against Lee’s plan.

“The bill removes the requirements for ‘public involvement’ [and] ‘protection of areas of critical environmental concern,’ among others,” county commissioners and seven other elected officials wrote Barrasso in June. Provisions already exist for the sale of such lands, they said, whereas Lee’s measure “effectively eliminates any shred of input from local citizens.”
Sublette’s county seat, Pinedale, is a community that uses neighboring public lands and “is very vocal” when somebody wants to develop them, resident Karla Bird said. She urged the commissioners to get involved.
“Even [commissioners] didn’t know this fast-paced land sale was in the bill,” Bird said. “It wasn’t just this year’s proposal. What was going to be happening next year and the year after that — sales every 60 days?”
Bird had only asked commissioners to engage with Gov. Mark Gordon over what lands might be sold. It was “a bonus,” she said, when the elected officials wrote a letter opposing the measure outright.
Another Sublette resident — logger and sawmill operator Mark Domek of Cora — supported his local elected officials and the Outdoor Recreation Business Alliance he belongs to.
“I’m glad the commissioners had the backbone,” he said. “It is the wrong way to go,” he said of the proposed sales. “We want our public lands so everyone can use them.”
Hageman blames critics
Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman was unswayed by the wave of public opposition. The congresswoman said Wyomingites were being duped by Lee’s critics.
“A lot of the talk surrounding [Lee’s] efforts has been misleading or flat out untrue,” the Republican wrote in a statement ahead of his decision to back  down. She suggested voters didn’t understand the issue, blaming activists who are ignorant or “willfully distorting [the bill’s] contents to cynically spread unwarranted fear among citizens.”
Lee’s mandatory disposal provision, “does not authorize the mass sale of federal lands,” Hageman wrote, only “about two to three million acres.”
“It is apparent that those organizations and individuals who oppose Senator Lee’s proposal recognize the vast majority of Americans would support it as being a common-sense and reasonable approach to managing a tiny fraction of BLM and USFS lands,” Hageman stated.
That theory was tested at a town hall Hageman convened in Greybull last month. “Often throughout her presentation, Hageman was interrupted by shouts of protest,” the Greybull Standard reported.
“This is a pivotal piece of legislation that could change the landscape,” Lovell Mayor Tom Newman said at the town hall, “maybe not in my lifetime, but it could change the landscape of the western United States.”
In Wyoming, 58% of respondents oppose giving state government control over national public lands, let alone selling the property for development, according to a Colorado College survey published earlier this year.
Barrasso said in a statement that he listened to mayors, county commissioners, legislators as well as hunters and fishermen, friends and neighbors. “The people of Wyoming deserve to have their voices heard on such an important matter,” he said.
He didn’t comment on existing law that allows federal agencies to sell land in a studied manner. But, if a Lee-like bill is to be considered again, “it must be thoroughly debated through regular order with committee hearings and with input from all concerned,” Barasso said.
Lummis didn’t respond to a request for comment on the land-sale provision. But on Tuesday, she issued a list of 25 “wins” in the Big Beautiful Bill as passed by the Senate. Preserving public lands was not among them.
For business owners who make a living off public lands, that property is their supply chain, business alliance leader Jenkins said. “The idea of losing access is pretty scary,” she said.
Musher Moore said the land sale issue had been percolating for a while. “This proposal kind of pushed it into the spotlight and made everybody say ‘No, thank you,’” she said.
EcoTour Adventures owner Phillips said Americans recognize the value of the wide-open West and want to keep that as part of their national identity.
“We are incredibly unique in that we have these large tracts of lands that are protected and managed by the federal government,” he said. “Most places around the world can’t say that.”
Wildlife guide Gocke sees that sentiment in his clients after they spot a moose five minutes from town. He talked about wide-eyed children looking through spotting scopes at bighorn rams, bison on the grasslands, perhaps even a bear or wolf.
“People are just floored,” he said. “People are craving it and can’t get enough. I don’t recall any tour that I went on where people were disappointed.” 
Backcountry hunter Hettick said lawmakers are now on notice. “The American public will jump right down your throat if you continue this.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy want you to believe they’re “fiscally conservative.”
That’s adorable. Really.
I mean, if giving $4 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires while detonating the national debt like a Fourth of July firework is “conservative,” then I’m a bald eagle in a MAGA hat.
Let’s be clear: the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” is neither big-hearted nor beautiful. It’s one more sleazy giveaway to the ultra-rich wrapped in red, white and bologna. And our senators? They’re all in—like kids at a billionaire birthday party hoping for a gold-plated goody bag.
This monstrosity of a bill hands out tax breaks to the people who least need them while cutting Medicaid, food assistance, Pell grants, and anything else that keeps working Montanans afloat. Oh, and bonus points: it’ll add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt and increase our interest payments by more than $55 billion per year. Because what could possibly go wrong with borrowing money to fund yachts?
Meanwhile, we’re already paying over a trillion a year in interest alone—more than our entire defense budget. But don’t worry, Daines and Sheehy have a plan: Just kick poor kids off food stamps and tell grandma to take her chances without Medicaid.
They call this “reform.” I call it cruelty with a calculator. It is offensive and morally repugnant.
This bill will:

 Strip healthcare from nearly 12 million Americans—because apparently preventative care is a luxury.
 Carve $1.2 trillion out of Medicaid and food stamps—because what better way to show fiscal responsibility than by yanking healthcare and groceries from the poor while handing tax breaks to the uber-rich?
Eliminate 800,000 jobs—because what’s a little unemployment among friends?
Spike energy bills and gut future clean energy development—because the planet isn’t dying fast enough.
Slash food and nutrition programs—because nothing says “compassionate conservatism” like taking groceries away from low-income families. Republicans want to gut SNAP benefits for 1.3 million Americans. Why? Because apparently, hungry children build character, and cutting food assistance makes billionaires feel even more full.
Make it harder for low-income students to access Pell grants—because education should be for those who can already afford it.

Oh, and let’s not forget the bill’s all-out assault on immigrants, formerly incarcerated individuals, and anyone who thought AI should be regulated before it starts deciding who gets hired, arrested or evicted.
All this is packed into more than 900 pages of what really ought to be titled “The Oligarch Protection Act.” And let’s be honest—what are the chances Daines and Sheehy actually read the whole thing? I’d bet they skimmed the donor wish-list and skipped the rest.
So why are Daines and Sheehy cheerleading this dumpster fire?
Simple: It makes Trump happy. And when Trump’s happy, Republican Senators wag their tails and roll over. If it hurts Montana? Collateral damage. If it bankrupts the country? Oopsie!
Daines once claimed he went to Washington to “rein in the debt.” Apparently, he meant he’d saddle it up and ride it straight off a cliff. And Tim Sheehy, Montana’s most recent Trump ventriloquist dummy, is already proving he’s ready to abandon working families for champagne fundraisers and Fox News soundbites.
Let’s be honest: This isn’t conservative governance. It’s corporate feudalism. And if you’re not in the top 1%, you’re the serf.
So the next time Sheehy and Daines talk “Montana values,” remember this: They sold you out to billionaires and called it beautiful.  No wonder they refuse to face Montana citizens at a real town hall meeting.
I’d laugh—if it weren’t so dangerous.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-03 07:01:58.243765

 News of $300K in cuts to county’s libraries had patrons up in arms. County officials warn it’s just the beginning as more Wyoming tax cuts could be on the way. 
The post Fremont County library flap, a symptom of broader property tax pains, angers patrons appeared first on WyoFile .","This story is part of a WyoFile series looking at the impacts of property tax reductions across the state. 


Belt tightening was the mandate in Fremont County this spring in response to a multi-million-dollar drop in tax revenue. Commissioners, the bearer of bad news, asked county departments to contemplate 10% budget cuts with measures like leaving open positions vacant, raising fees or eliminating costs. 
So when news broke that the library system — which operates facilities in Lander, Riverton and Dubois — was facing a 23% cut of $300,000, library patrons were up in arms.  
“The community would really like to understand why the library specifically is being asked to cut its budget so significantly compared to other departments,” former library staffer Sarah Reilley told the commission during a public hearing. She was among several people who criticized the cuts as undue and harmful.
“What does $300,000 look like, as a cut?” Cody Beers, president of the Fremont County Library Foundation, asked the commission in the same hearing. “We’re talking services, we’re talking people, we’re talking lessening the ability of our young people and readers in our community to access our library.” 
Others urged the preservation of services like story times and adult educational programming they called crucial for healthy communities. 
Commissioners defended their process, saying they did not target the library for comparatively larger cuts as some kind of punishment. The library, they said, portrayed the budget cut as some kind of statement of disapproval, which panicked its ardent supporters. 
“We did not mandate it,” Commission Chair Larry Allen said. “We asked for options to explain what the impacts of cuts would be.”
Interpretations aside, the library ultimately received a $100,000 donation from the Fremont County Library Foundation and obtained county approval to re-allocate an additional $100,000 earmarked for collection development in order to backfill. The library also identified special revenue funds to fill in holes. That left it short roughly $53,000, according to a county budget spreadsheet. 
The cut will be reflected by a reduction of 64 staff hours per week, Fremont County Libraries Director Anita Marple said, meaning two vacant positions at its libraries in Dubois, Lander and Riverton will remain unfilled and another part-time library assistant will be laid off. The libraries may reduce operating hours as well, she said, but those changes have not been finalized.

The county approved its final budget in late June with a total of $2.5 million in cuts. Department cuts ranged from 19% from the commissioners’ budget, 35% from the county clerk’s election budget, 2% from the county attorney’s office and 88% from courthouse security. Positions were left vacant, contracts reassessed and fees hiked. 
Though a library solution was reached, discussions were fraught with hand-wringing and accusations — and library supporters still maintain the cut was unjust. 
The flare-up is the latest in long-running library tensions in central Wyoming. But it’s also a symptom of the struggles local governments and special tax districts around the state face as they reckon with significant property tax cuts ushered in by a new state law. 
Senate File 69, “Homeowner property tax exemption,” applies a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a single-family home’s fair market value. This translates into smaller pools of funds for a myriad of special local districts — from hospitals to ambulances, museums and school districts. And with more tax-cutting proposals on the horizon, budget crunchers like the ones in Fremont County are warning that this is just the beginning. 
Commissioner Allen pointed to a measure on the November ballot that could bring further cuts. If passed, he said, “we’re looking at over a third of our budget just disappearing,” he said. 
If that happens, he warned, “we will probably only just have one library. And we’re not just picking on the library. We are picking on everybody.”
Number crunching
Several factors made budget projecting, never an easy task, more difficult in Fremont County this year. The 25% property tax drop certainly spelled cuts, but new tax exemptions, ongoing property assessments and fluctuations in mineral revenues also created a moving target.
Not all special districts in Wyoming had to deal with the same complicated puzzle, but they all saw tax generation drop. That’s because special districts are funded by mill levies, which draw from property taxes. 
Senate File 69 was among a raft of homeowner relief bills brought to the Wyoming Legislature in the last two years. Lawmakers were prompted, they said, by vociferous constituent concern that property taxes are too high in the state. 
Dozens of special district representatives, including first responders, community colleges and fire departments, urged lawmakers to reconsider, given the drastic service cuts the measure would require due to millions of dollars in lost revenue. 
Those pleas were not enough to sway lawmakers, and special districts have been wrestling with budget cuts since.

In Fremont County, a finance team started in January to prepare for a worst-case-scenario $5 million drop in taxes. With that number in mind, they asked county departments to contemplate a 10% cut. The commission also extended a wage and hiring freeze, meaning departments cannot hire for open positions or raise an employee’s pay without requesting an exemption.
“So the question to everybody was: Do the best you can in your budget, and then if you are able to raise your revenues, your user fees, we will do that,” County Clerk Julie Freese said in a presentation to the commission. 
Encompassing more than 9,000 square miles, Fremont is a huge county, with departments that range from roads to elections, solid waste, vital records, law enforcement and courts. Talking through and finalizing the departmental budget cuts ate up hours of meetings and public hearings. 
The commission used a priority system, said Commissioner Mike Jones, who is the library board liaison. The highest priority for funding included services the county is required by law to provide, such as roads, titles and a sheriff’s department. Second was the groups that support the statutory mandates. Third was non-statutory services like the fair, recreation board or museums that not everyone uses. While Wyoming counties are mandated to operate one library in their county seat, Fremont County has three — which is why they consider it in the last, he said. 
“We’ve been asking our non-statutories over the last six years … to grow their own self-generated revenue,” Jones said. “So the claim that [the libraries] were being picked on is not really true.” 
Commissioners asked all their departments how far they could stretch and reduce their budgets, Jones said. They asked for scenarios showing how services would be impacted, he said, but the library board didn’t satisfy that request. 
The library board didn’t see it that way.
Doors, staff
“At the very beginning, Commissioner Mike Jones wanted to know what a $300,000 reduction to the library board would look like,” Marple said. She interpreted that as the county’s intention, she said, not really up for negotiation. She also aimed to preserve library services as they are. 
Marple crafted eight options for the commission contemplating cuts ranging from 10% to 23%. 
“I wanted them to see the difference that even 1% makes to our budget and what we can do,” she said of her options. “I was also very specific in how we would accomplish this reduction with the primary goal of preserving library services for the community as much as we could.”
To do that, she found sources to patch many of the holes. One: The Fremont County Library Foundation changed its bylaws in order to give $100,000 to the county library system for operations. Two: Marple identified $100,000 of library funds earmarked for collections that she wanted to transfer to the general funds. The library board needed commission approval to transfer those funds.

Commissioners, however, appeared frustrated with Marple and the library board, citing a lack of specificity on how the options would translate to public impacts. In a June 9 budget work session, they agreed to ask for the full $300,000 cut — and deny the library the option of transferring that $100,000 in earmarked monies. 
Days later, the library board called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation. Without the $100,000 transfer, they agreed, the libraries would be open fewer days a week, programs would be reduced and services would suffer. 
Library board member John Angst was openly upset with what he called a disproportionate cut. “We were disrespected and the fact is we didn’t get a justification for the $300K in the first place,” he said. 
The following week, the library board came back before the commission officially asking for approval of the $100,000 transfer. Library supporters also showed up in force to defend the library and criticize the proposed cuts. 
“I don’t understand why the library is being cut 23% versus all other agencies or departments’ 10%,” Linda Barton said. 
Jones doubled down on his request for specifics.
“I see a little shuffling here and shuffling there, that to me is not really what I was after in terms of impact,” Jones said. “Here is the underlying question of the whole thing: If we pull $300,000, are you going to have to close one of the doors?”
Without the $100,000 transfer, multiple libraries will close one day a week, library board member Kristen McClelland said. Meeting rooms won’t be as available, programs like story times, Lego clubs and afterschool programs will be reduced and some computers will probably go dark, she continued. 
That answer finally satisfied Jones, who said he had been seeking that level of specifics. Commissioner Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, admonished the library board for not advocating for a lower cut that it could reasonably maintain. 
“We had all these people come in and get after us about the 23%,” Thomas said. “Those people should be yelling at you, not us.”
Freese, the county clerk and budget officer, clarified that she “sent the message to them to cut $300,000 from its budget because that’s what you asked me to do.” 
The board was under the impression that $300,000 was a mandate, McClelland said. 
“Shame on us as a board for having this miscommunication or not understanding, but we thought that this is the option that we were given,” McClelland said.
In the end, the commission then voted 3-2 to approve the full $100,000 fund transfer.
Future actions 
Fremont County library patrons won’t experience the more drastic service cuts that were laid out. At least, not yet. 
But if Wyoming continues down the path of tax reductions, libraries — along with services that range from museums to irrigation and cemeteries — may not be so fortunate. A citizen-led property tax initiative will ask voters in November to cut 50% of residential property taxes. Lawmakers also are discussing abolishing property taxes entirely. 
Commissioner Allen said the county’s budget scenario will become dire if the ballot initiative passes, with huge impacts to things like transportation, emergency services and roads.

“It’s going to impact everything in the county,” Library board member Perry Cook agreed. “It’ll be a disaster.” Cook suggested a concerted effort to inform county voters about what their property taxes actually fund and what’s at stake. 
Because while the library was able to find extra sources of funds this year, including the one-time gift from the Fremont County Library Foundation, Marple said it can’t simply count on that level of generosity going forward. 
“We now have a year to plan for what comes next,” she said, adding that the property tax cuts are detrimental in many ways. “It’s devastating municipal and county government budgets. And ultimately, it’s harming citizens.”

Legislative plans to do away with property taxes would mean greater inequality in the Equality State, writes columnist David Romtvedt.

Opinion

Property taxes in Wyoming have risen dramatically, and in an attempt to provide relief to residential homeowners, the Wyoming Legislature passed several bills earlier this year. One offered a 50% reduction for homeowners over 65 who have paid residential property tax in Wyoming for 25 years or more. But the reduction is only for two years, only applies to the first $200,000 of fair-market value, and requires an application process with the assessor’s office. The Legislature also passed a bill giving a permanent 25% reduction to all homeowners for the first $1 million of fair-market value, but you can’t get this reduction if you request the 50% exemption on up to $200,000 fair-market value. In some cases, the 25% reduction would save a homeowner more than the 50%. You’ll have to figure it out yourself.
Less than a year after passing these property tax relief laws, many of the same legislators who voted for them now say the system is too complicated and confusing for taxpayers. To solve the problem they created, they now suggest abolishing property taxes altogether — residential, commercial, industrial, and personal — by repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution and raising the sales tax rate.
As sales tax is a flat percentage on all purchases, regardless of the buyer’s income, it puts a greater burden on lower-income households. Because there are certain things we must buy, we can’t simply cut back on purchases to save on our tax bill. This systemic advantage for those with higher incomes makes sales tax the least equitable tax system we could devise.
Another problem is that abolishing property tax would hurt municipalities and counties more than the state. That’s because property taxes do not fund state government. Rather, they provide the money we need for local fire and police departments, K-12 schools, roads and sidewalks, senior centers, hospitals, water and sewer systems, community colleges and libraries.
But here’s the real rub — property taxes brought in about $2 billion in 2024 while sales and use taxes provided $1.4 billion. If you abolish property tax, you still have to raise that $2 billion along with the $1.4 billion that the sales tax now generates, arriving at a total of $3.4 billion. To do this, the state’s 4.0% sales tax rate would have to more than double to 9.7%. Since the sales tax amount generated by counties is wildly uneven, ranging from $821.34 per person in Fremont County to $3,754.86 per person in Teton County, it would be very hard to provide equitable services throughout the state. It’s a formula for lawsuits.
Progressive income and property taxes were initiated to help us provide uniform public services to all, independent of wealth. For over a hundred years, we’ve accepted that the percentage at which one is taxed should be higher for those with higher incomes and greater wealth. I should say: sort of accepted. Some people ask, “You’re going to charge me at a higher rate just because I have more money?” Well, yes, we are because we need to provide public services for everyone and because some can afford to pay more and still have plenty.
Watching my father work so hard to earn so little, I can remember as a kid thinking it was wrong for some people to have great wealth while others scraped by. I didn’t know anything about politics or economics — I just had that feeling. Later, I learned that in the Bible’s Acts of the Apostles 4:32-35, Jerusalem was said to be a place where people were of one heart and one soul with property held in common and goods and services distributed to all according to need.
The late historian Ramsay McMullen, author of “Corruption and the Decline of Rome,” was asked by an interviewer if he could summarize the evolution of Rome in a single sentence. He said he could do it in three words — fewer have more. That’s what I see happening where I live, and it’s not good for me or my community. I hope we can create a tax system that will be fair to all while fully funding the needs of all, one that doesn’t place the greatest burden on those with the least wealth. We live, after all, in the Equality State.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)It took a riot and multiple indictments, but the chorus of calls is growing to boot the state’s private-prison operator out of a Hartsville correctional center.
Republican state Rep. Michael Hale of Smithville, saying in a social media post he is “deeply concerned” about recurring problems at Trousdale Turner, joined District Attorney General Jason Lawson in calling for the Tennessee Department of Correction to take over operations at the facility run under contract with Brentwood-based CoreCivic.
The Trousdale County grand jury recently returned 41 indictments for incidents at Trousdale Turner, 12 of them connected to the June 8 riot when inmates stabbed a staffer and took over an inner yard. Lawson said more indictments will be issued as investigators review video footage.
In seeking a new operator, Lawson said crimes at the prison have added hundreds of cases to Trousdale County’s court docket over the last few years, roughly one every four days. Yet adding time to inmates’ sentences doesn’t improve inmate safety at the prison.
“The continued problems demonstrate that CoreCivic is unable to address the issues. I understand that Tennessee needs the bedspace at Trousdale Turner to house state prisoners, however, it is long overdue that the state of Tennessee shifted the management of Trousdale Turner from CoreCivic into the direct hands of the Tennessee Department of Correction,” Lawson said in a statement.
The legislature passed a measure this year designed to penalize CoreCivic by removing inmates from the prisons it operates if the death rate at any of those facilities exceeds the rate at state-run prisons.










The continued problems demonstrate that CoreCivic is unable to address the issues. . . It is long overdue that the state of Tennessee shifted the management of Trousdale Turner from CoreCivic into the direct hands of the Tennessee Department of Correction.

The early June riot is causing a greater awakening.
But Gov. Bill Lee remains slow to act and doesn’t appear to be anywhere near putting the state over Trousdale Turner.
“The state has an obligation to hold CoreCivic accountable,” Lee said this week in response to questions. Lee acknowledged, though, the state is responsible for making sure the prison operates correctly.
He declined to discuss details or whether CoreCivic should make changes as authorities investigate. 
The state has penalized the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, including $15 million in late 2024 and early 2025. Liquidated damages total $570,825 this year alone.
Those are mainly for personnel shortages at CoreCivic-run prisons, which were 7 percentage points higher than at state-operated facilities early this year and cause problems with overseeing inmates.
The state pays CoreCivic about $240 million annually despite audits detailing low staffing, violence and deaths, and a federal civil rights investigation into Trousdale Turner, which hasn’t stopped, even under the Trump administration.

Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin said he and other lawmakers, as well as constituents, are “fed up” with the problems at Trousdale Turner, according to the Hartsville Vidette.
Haile isn’t quite ready for the state to take over the prison and noted he isn’t certain what steps the Department of Correction would have to take since operations involve a three-way contract of sorts between Tennessee, Trousdale County and CoreCivic. He plans to visit prisons to get a better understanding.
“I’m not at that point. I won’t say that I might not get there. But there’s got to be some drastic changes up there, and I know they’ve made some,” Haile said.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who sponsored the bill to penalize CoreCivic for high death rates, told the Lookout he wants a review of the entire prison system. He is set to tour the facility with Correction Commissioner Frank Strada, who has called CoreCivic a “partner” with the state.
“I’m going up there to hammer out what this looks like and what the options might be,” Pody said. “We definitely can’t have what just happened with that riot and guards being taken hostage.”
Trousdale Turner is the most “visible” problem, Pody said, but he believes the issues run “deeper” than Trousdale.
Get on board
Add Lee to the list of Republican state leaders who believe Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell should be oblivious to ICE sweeps in the city he governs.
Following the dragnet of a South Nashville neighborhood in early June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up nearly 200 immigrants, O’Connell updated an executive order requiring Metro Nashville personnel to notify his office within 24 hours of an ICE encounter. Former Mayor David Briley issued the original order five years earlier, but O’Connell is taking the political heat these days from people such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who urged him to rescind it. O’Connell came under federal scrutiny, too, when Metro accidentally posted the identities of ICE agents involved in the roundup.
Lee isn’t fond of the executive order.
House Speaker demands Nashville mayor ax order to report federal immigration interactions

“I don’t think it’s helpful that they report that. I think anything that impedes the assistance toward the federal government’s efforts, anything that impedes that is not helpful,” he said during a short press conference this week.
Oddly enough, Lee and other Tennessee lawmakers frequently say the federal government should keep its nose out of state business such as educating kids, including special needs children, and taking care of the poor – until the state is overwhelmed by something such as a massive flood.
Once President Donald Trump started his deportation program, Lee jumped at the opportunity to spend money helping the feds pull immigrants off the streets, putting $200 million toward grants for local law enforcement to join the battle and creating a secretive immigration enforcement bureau within the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security. Interestingly enough, it hired a director before the fiscal 2025-26 budget took effect July 1. 
Is that jumping the gun? 
Either way, Lee appears to love the feds more than one of his own mayors.
Nevermind, go ahead
The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee approved a three-year $30.6 million contract this week with Fast Enterprises to run the Department of Revenue’s tax collection system despite lawmakers’ reservations that it signaled a 40% cost increase.
Republican Rep. Rush Bricken of Tullahoma raised the biggest fuss, saying the state is paying substantially more for 15 Enterprise employees than it is for the computer program.
Bricken told Revenue officials the state “doesn’t need 15 folks sitting around waiting for direction.” 
A department representative responded that those people are not twiddling their thumbs, instead responding yearly to multiple legislative changes in tax collections and, in fact, are “more cost-effective than state employees.”
“I hope they do work hard,” Bricken said, considering their salaries are costing the state about $466,000 per person.
But as Bricken and other lawmakers questioned the expense, they were notified the state had moved forward with the contract on Monday, the day before the Fiscal Review meeting, using a waiver to execute it.
Fiscal Review Director Bojan Savic told lawmakers the state had to work quickly because its contract with Fast Enterprises was expiring.
Rather than send the contract back to the drawing board, lawmakers took a voice vote to forge ahead.
After this tempest of sorts, everybody came out happy, especially those making nearly half a million a year.
Bring your cushions
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada is seeking a new trial after being convicted in a four-week political corruption case.
Casada’s attorneys say prosecutors inadvertently played audiotape of his initial interview with FBI agents when he said co-defendant Cade Cothren, his former chief of staff, couldn’t “deal” because Speaker Sexton didn’t like him. The playing of that unredacted recording, which nearly led to a mistrial, is the basis for the new trial request, according to The Tennessean.
Cothren was convicted on 19 counts and Casada on 17 counts of bribery, kickbacks, fraud and money laundering connected to a secret political vendor named Phoenix Solutions that operated from late 2019 to mid-2020. 
Casada and Cothren were expected to appeal the verdict anyway. The question is whether anyone can stand to sit on those federal court benches for another four weeks. They will put a body in traction.

In or out?
Rumors have been flying for more than a year about a congressional run by House Speaker Sexton. But in a short chat Tuesday with the Lookout, Sexton said he is not running for Congress.
Still, he’s set to make a big announcement in August. Unless he’s admitting he lives in Nashville instead of Crossville, it won’t be much of a news event, unless, of course, he says he will be seeking the governor’s office. That would put him head-to-head with U.S. Rep. John Rose and, possibly, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who has been crowned the next governor but hasn’t officially entered the race. 
According to news reports, she pushed a moratorium on state oversight of artificial intelligence out of Trump’s budget plan, proving she is worth every piece of China she smashed in a campaign ad before the last election.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
The North Dakota Legislature this year passed a bill allowing for nuclear energy research.
Nuclear energy research gets green light in North Dakota

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Allen Best/Big Pivots)This story originally appeared in Big Pivots.
Coal-burning for electrical generation will end in Craig before New Year’s Day of 2028 arrives. Will a new gas plant arrive in 2029 to partially replace the lost generation?
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association says it needs a 307-megawatt gas plant there to ensure electricity will be available for its members across its four-state service territory, but particularly western Colorado.
Three conservation groups argue strenuously that Tri-State can keep the lights on without the gas plant — and at a cost that is $288 million less and with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. They instead recommend more battery storage in lieu of the gas plant.
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to make a decision on July 10. However, the PUC commissioners must first decide whether to order Tri-State to conduct additional modeling, as the conservation groups want. New modeling, however, would take time.
“Time is of the essence,” Tri-State said in a PUC filing on June 25. It warned of “serious risk of cost escalation” if procurement of renewables is delayed, citing snarled supply chains and rising prices caused by the tariffs imposed on imports by President Donald Trump, and a reshaped tax landscape in the budget reconciliation bill before Congress.

For example, nearly all battery cells come from China. Many photovoltaic solar components also come from China. And the budget bill would strip tax credits for most renewable projects.
New gas plants have problems, too. Rising demand has caused lengthening wait times and higher prices. Companies that have not yet reserved the giant metal turbines now face waits of three or four years, about twice as long as just a year earlier, reported the New York Times in April. The report cited rapidly increasing demand from data centers.
“With demand for gas turbines reaching new heights and tariffs further threatening international supply chains, costs for new gas plants are soaring,” said a team from Boulder- and Basalt-based RMI in a June 18 report.
Colorado in the next five years will put coal in its rear-view mirror. The state got 80% of its electricity from coal combustion at the start of the 21st century. That had slipped to 60% in 2015. By the end of 2030, the state’s last coal plant, Comanche 3, located in Pueblo, will go silent.
All the state’s largest utilities are investing heavily in wind, solar and lithium-ion batteries. They are also hedging their bets with new gas plants. Brighton-based United Power is in the lead. During July it will formally dedicate a new 162-megawatt gas plant about 45 miles northeast of downtown Denver. The electrical cooperative is currently exempt from PUC regulation.
Xcel Energy, like Tri-State, must gain approval of the PUC commissioners. In another case currently before the PUC, Xcel says it needs between 1,050 megawatts and 2,625 megawatts of new generation as it closes coal plants and gets ready for a massive increase in new demand, about two-thirds of it from data centers. How real is that projected demand? Question marks littered the testimony in recent hearings before the PUC.
Two other utilities, Platte River Power Authority and Colorado Springs Utilities, also plan new gas plants. And like United, they are also exempt from PUC regulation.
The dispute about the gas plant at Craig revolves around perceptions of risk and uncertainty. Reliability of electrical supplies remains paramount. How to achieve that without significant cost increases?
Long-distance transmission across multiple time zones and weather systems will help. That, however, is both expensive and usually takes a decade or longer.
  Banks of batteries have become integral parts of new energy resources. This is a battery bank owned by United Power located adjacent to a substation along Bromley Road in Brighton. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Reliable and affordable long-duration storage has become the holy grail in this energy transition. For example, Xcel Energy is partnering with Form Energy in an iron-air pilot project in Pueblo. This technology stores energy by essentially “rusting” iron during discharge and “unrusting” it during charging, making it a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage for up to 100 hours.
The difference this particular longer-duration technology will make in future needs is not clear. Xcel certainly is not betting its future on an outcome. It wants natural gas, too.
As for Tri-State, it views a gas plant as having 95% reliability compared to 50% for renewables. It frets that it has no experience with battery storage, although in any scenario it will soon have many of them in various parts of Colorado and New Mexico.
The question then becomes, in part, whether to delay expensive investments in a new natural gas plant for a couple years to see what new technological wrinkles may make that investment unnecessary.
Tri-State 15 years ago remained heavily dusted with coal. As former Gov. Bill Ritter noted at a recent event, Tri-State’s leaders then fervently believed their future lay in coal forevermore. It’s a substantially different utility now. It will retire the first of the three units at Craig by the end of 2025 with the remaining two in 2027. It owns another unit in Arizona, at Springerville, which it will close in 2030. After that, it will own just one coal-burning unit at the Laramie River Station in Wyoming.
As it prepares to leave coal mostly behind, Tri-State has begun building large amounts of new renewables, including a solar farm in the Axial Basin south of Craig, near a coal mine.
This plan calls for the addition of 700 megawatts of wind and solar between 2026 and 2031. On top of that Tri-State wants to add 650 megawatts of four-hour battery storage.
As for gas, it proposes to replace the five turbines at the J.M. Shafer plant near Fort Lupton, increasing the capacity from 272 megawatts to 281 megawatts. The environmental community has no quarrel with that plan.










I’ve always been climate-conscious and truly believe there’s no limit to the number of efforts we should be pursuing in an attempt to avoid the worst of what could come if we don’t do enough about climate change.


– John Clark, mayor of Ridgway 


The new gas plant at Craig is the fulcrum for the dispute. Tri-State says it needs the eight new turbines of natural gas at Craig specially for peak demands or when renewables come short. The environmental community maintains that 550 megawatts of battery storage beyond what Tri-State proposes will do the trick.
“Although battery integration is important for a balanced energy strategy, the immediate needs of the Western Colorado system, particularly in the transition away from coal, require the inclusion of reliable dispatchable resources like gas plants to ensure system reliability,” the utility said in a June 10 filing.
Just transition is another element of the conversation. In 2019, state legislators adopted goals for an 80% decrease in emissions by 2030 as compared to 2025 levels. On the coattails of that goal-setting was the declaration that “strong and comprehensive policy is … needed to invest new financial resources in coal communities that are seeking to diversify and grow their local and regional economies in a manner that is both sustainable and equitable.”
In a settlement agreement reached in June 2024, Tri-State committed to paying $22 million to Craig and Moffat County from 2026 through 2029 to aid the community’s energy transition.
Tri-State is also on the hook for an addition $48 million in the next decade for lost property tax base — unless it adds new tax base. In that case, the new tax base will be deducted from the utility’s obligations. Part of its plan is to place 200 megawatts of battery storage in the Craig area by 2030. A gas plant would help even more, as Craig and Moffat County point out in their comments in support of Tri-State.
Once again, does Tri-State really need the gas plant to ensure the lights stay on during hot summer days and winter weeks when wind wanes as it did during Storm Uri in February 2021.
The conservation coalition — Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Western Resource Advocates — insist Tri-State has not proven the need. In a June 18 filing with the PUC, they raised what they call “serious questions about the accuracy of Tri-State’s modeling.” They want the PUC to order Tri-State to conduct new modeling, a move that Tri-State resists because of the added time. Again, it says, time is of the essence.
Costs of the gas/no gas choices can be measured in several ways. Tri-State prefers a financial measuring stick called present value of revenue requirements to assess the cost of the extra-batteries option. This tool provides the total costs over the next 19 years.
By this measure, the heavier investment in batteries will require Tri-State to generate $88 million over the next 19 years. That difference is just 0.5% more in revenue spread across the more than $16 billion in revenue Tri-State projects is needed for both portfolios, say the conservation groups. A small price, say the conservation groups, of just 0.5% of increased cost in an outlay of more than $16 billion in capital outlays.
If the social costs of carbon and methane are factored in, the no-gas alternative will actually be cheaper, contend Western Resource Advocates and the two allied groups, the Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council. The PUC is required to consider these climate change impacts but is not required to use it as a basis for a decision. By the calculations of the conservation groups, this puts the new gas plant at $327 million — or 3.6% more expensive.
The most compelling numbers for the environmental advocates are the up-front capital costs. By that measure, building the gas plant and new transmission needed for its preferred projects will cost $288 million more than the deeper investment in batteries.
 What others had to say

Other agencies and groups at the table (called “intervenors” in PUC dockets) didn’t raise objections to the gas plant. The Office of Utility Consumer Advocate, for example, saw the benefit to Moffat County as a positive more important than the “slightly higher emissions” caused by the new gas plant. It buys Tri-State’s argument about improved reliability.
The Colorado Energy Office urged that Tri-State explore sharing gas production with Xcel Energy, which is also closing its coal plants in northwestern Colorado. (Tri-State responded that it has explored that possibility but gave no evidence that the conversations were producing anything.)
The energy office and San Miguel County also mentioned a hope that Tri-State would get electricity from enhanced geothermal. Tri-State reported it had received a bid for a 20-megawatt geothermal plant, likely the first such bid in Colorado. It did not select it.
John Clark, the mayor of Ridgway, also wrote in support of geothermal. “I’ve always been climate-conscious and truly believe there’s no limit to the number of efforts we should be pursuing in an attempt to avoid the worst of what could come if we don’t do enough about climate change,” Clark told Big Pivots in an e-mail.
“We live in a promising area for geothermal,” he added, and enhanced geothermal — created by tapping heat from deep well — is an around-the-clock source of energy.
If Tri-State is based in Colorado and has its largest number of electrical cooperatives within Colorado, it also supplies electrical cooperatives in Wyoming and New Mexico and public power districts in Nebraska. It’s one system stretched across the four states. Members from all four states wrote letters both in support and against the gas plant.
Most supportive of the gas plant were the eight member cooperatives in Wyoming. They pointed to double-digit rate increases projected by Tri-State and continued rate impacts for the next decade. They suggested that the costs are due to adding renewables and the goals for emissions reductions.
From New Mexico came exactly the opposite argument from several state legislators, county commissioners, and Navajo Nation members. The alternative favored by conservationists is a “viable — and superior — alternative to spending several hundred million dollars on a gas plant that will emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases over its expected operating life,” they said.
Colorado elected officials have also weighed in with a letter signed by 33 individuals from town, city, and county staffs as well as elected officials. That letter, too, made the economic case against a new gas plant as well as the climate benefits.
Chaffee County Commissioner PT Wood, one of the signatories, told Big Pivots that he has personal doubts the reliability of natural gas. Coal was supposed to be reliable, but the Comanche 3 generating station at Pueblo has been closed for extended periods. Plus, he sees the extraction of natural gas as being “incredibly harmful to the landscape.”
Many individual letters were filed with the PUC, obviously developed using a common template but with some localized embellishment.
From Mancos, west of Durango, Brandi Lynn Piller described a new gas-fired plant as “fraught with financial risks due to volatile market prices and high construction costs.”
From Walsh, a few miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma borders, Fred and Kay Lyn Hefley noted the installation of two 50-kWh wind generators on their farm. “We strongly urge Tri-State to achieve its goal of 100% clean energy in Colorado by 2040 using wind and solar power.”
And from Matheson, on the windy plains about 50 miles east of Colorado Springs, Jan Kochis, and her husband, Virgil Kochis, said they strongly oppose the gas plant at Craig because it “contradicts Colorado’s decarbonization goals and risks becoming an obsolete asset, potentially burdening co-op members with hundreds of millions in stranded costs, as seen in past fossil fuel missteps.” They have 30 wind turbines on their property that generate electricity for Xcel.
Martha Whitmore, of Ridgway, saw it entirely differently. Whitmore said Tri-State was going far too far into renewables. They are “not constant, not reliable and (are) expensive to develop. If the State of Colorado is hell bent on eliminating reliable fuels, then the State had better get going with permitting new nuclear facilities. And, since the same enviros who scream about carbon also scream about not wanting nuclear power either, better not decommission our existing coal and natural gas power plants. We will be on rolling blackouts …”
Following is Tri-State’s preferred portfolio for 2026 and 2031 for 1,657 megawatts:
700 MW of renewable power purchase resources:

200 MW solar in Eastern Colorado (2028)
100 MW solar/battery hybrid in New Mexico (2028)
200 MW wind in Eastern Colorado (2029)

In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24.
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.”
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.

I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
People across Colorado ​demonstrate against Trump administration ​i​n ‘No Kings’ ​protests

As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case.
The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values.
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.

(Jon Cherry | Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.











It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

As of July 2, FEMA approved 206 individual assistance applications, totaling around $948,000 in housing assistance and $871,000 in assistance for other needs.
The individual assistance funding is in addition to public assistance funds approved to help local governments pay for repairs to public property and infrastructure.
President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for some Tennessee counties on June 20, more than two months after Gov. Bill Lee requested federal assistance to recover from destructive tornadoes and once-in-a-generation flooding.
The early April storms severely damaged an estimated 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits and killed 10 people. McNairy County’s emergency management agency estimated that an EF-3 tornado that hit Selmer, the county seat, caused around $27.6 million in private property damage alone. 
Trump approved individual assistance for eligible applicants in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties. 
This type of assistance can include grants for temporary housing or home repairs, post-disaster support services and low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses. FEMA aid does not apply to losses already covered by insurance, according to the agency’s website.
FEMA recommends affected individuals file a claim with their insurance company immediately, before applying for FEMA aid.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Help with applications is also available at Disaster Recovery Centers set up in each eligible county. Centers offer assistance information from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Have you dropped off some Independence Day barbecue at your favorite government office yet? 
Elected officials and government employees may now be gifted $81 worth of food and drink per individual for state holidays and religious occasions under a loosening of Louisiana ethics laws enacted last month. 
Gov. Jeff Landry signed a law that allows any person – including lobbyists, interest groups and business owners regulated by the government – to provide individual public servants “seasonal or holiday foods” and nonalcoholic beverages several times per year. 
The upper limit for the price of food and beverage gifts is set at $81 per holiday but will increase in future years. It is tied in law to the Consumer Price Index and has an opportunity to go up every July when the index changes. 
Previously, elected officials and public employees were prohibited from accepting most food and drink that wasn’t consumed in person at an event like a reception. 
The spending on in-person food and beverage consumption was limited to $50 per person in 2009 but has grown to $81 after being linked to inflation and other factors. 
Under the new law, a single government worker could receive $81 worth of food from several different people for a single holiday, without having to consume it at a party or reception. The cap on seasonal food gifts applies to the individual gift-giver, not the public servant receiving the gift. 
It also applies to a wide range of public sector workers. It covers people who work in both state and local government, everyone from the governor and town mayor to a police officer or motor vehicle office employee.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

For example, the new law would permit a wide range of government inspectors – people who monitor restaurants, industrial plants and health care facilities – to receive holiday food gifts from the entities they regulate.  
Supporters of the change have referred to the new provision as the “king cake rule,” meaning it allows government workers to receive and enjoy king cakes dropped off at their offices during Mardi Gras season. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics has also received several complaints from public servants who aren’t certain whether they can accept small food gifts like homemade cookies from the public. For example, a group of librarians was confused about whether they could eat baked goods dropped off by their patrons, according to state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon. King cakes and cookies rarely cost $81 per person however. 
Public school teachers may also face stricter gift limits than most other government workers with the new law in place. A preexisting statute prohibits K-12 school employees from accepting any gift worth over $25 per item  – and $75 in total for the whole school year – from a student or former student. 

There are 11 state holidays that would allow for seasonal food gifts: New Year’s, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Mardi Gras, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

It’s not clear what would count as a “religious holiday” under the law.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-03 06:01:48.941146

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)It was an encouraging week in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court finally invalidated a cruel 1849 abortion ban, and Gov. Tony Evers declared victory after he and state legislative leaders reached a deal on the state budget that adds back some badly needed support for schools and child care. The budget deal is not what a lot of Democrats and advocates wanted, but it’s better than the brutal austerity Republicans in the Legislature have imposed in the last several budget cycles. Most encouragingly, the end of gerrymandering forced Republicans to negotiate, since they needed Democratic votes in the Senate to get the budget passed.
Some Democrats still refused to vote ‘yes” on the budget. They pointed out that, while it includes a significant boost for special education, it leaves schools struggling with zero general state aid. A majority of school districts will see revenue go down, and most will have to beg local property owners to raise their own taxes. To make matters worse, the Trump administration is freezing billions in promised aid to K-12 schools. 
Child care advocates who fought for desperately needed state support got about one-quarter of the aid Evers had originally proposed. Some were relieved, but others told Examiner Deputy Editor Erik Gunn that it’s just not enough to save centers from going out of business and parents from losing access to care.
The health care outlook is also bleak. With the feds poised to make Medicaid cuts that could cause 60,000 Wisconsinites to lose health care, the state budget fails to expand Medicaid and won’t even cover postpartum care — making us one of only two states to refuse health care to low-income mothers of newborns.
The worrisome backdrop to all of this is the federal budget plan President Donald Trump and Republicans are pushing through Congress that simultaneously runs up giant deficits and takes an ax to safety net programs on a scale we’ve never before experienced. 
The massive bill that passed the U.S. Senate this week slashes health care and nutrition assistance and will lead to the closure of rural hospitals, decimate green infrastructure projects that have been a boon to Wisconsin and will make life harder and more expensive for most people — all to funnel millions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest Americans and to fund a chilling escalation of a militarized immigration police force. 
Our own U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson threatened to vote against the House version of the bill, which was projected to increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion, because, he said, the deficits it created were “mortgaging our children’s future.” But Johnson then voted for the Senate version, which ratchets up the deficit even more, to $3.3 trillion. So much for the self-described “numbers guy.” Kowtowing to Trump and making permanent the tax cuts Johnson personally benefits from was more important to him than his alleged concern about deficits.
It makes sense that much of the news about the Republican budget deal has centered around the devastating health care cuts and the ballooning federal deficit. But the $170 billion in the budget for immigration enforcement is sure to change the landscape of the United States — escalating raids, deportations without due process and a massive new system of private detention centers on the model of the detention camp in a Florida swamp that apparently thrilled Trump when he visited it during congressional budget deliberations.
Brace yourself for the impact of the supercharged ICE budget. Unlike Texas — where terrorized immigrant workers are staying home after raids, causing farmers to fear they’ll  go under as their labor force disappears — we haven’t experienced big workplace raids in Wisconsin. If ICE has a lot more manpower, that could change.
I spoke this week with a dairy farmer in the Western part of the state who reported that, despite the terrifying videos circulating online of violent arrests by masked immigration agents, his employees are carrying on as usual, coming to work, going out, not changing their plans. “We haven’t had any raids on dairy farms in Wisconsin,” he pointed out. 
It’s eerie how normal life continues to be in rural Wisconsin, where 70% of the labor on dairy farms is performed by immigrant workers, almost all of whom lack legal documents to live and work in this country, because Congress has never created a visa for year-round, low-skilled farmwork. The farmer I spoke with said he had just returned from watching a soccer match among immigrant workers and everyone was in a good mood.
He added that officials in Trump’s agriculture and labor departments have repeatedly reassured an industry group he’s part of that the administration understands how dependent employers are on their immigrant workers and that they don’t want mass deportation to harm them.
Wisconsin dairy farmers and other employers are hoping Trump continues to be influenced by the people in his administration who tell him he shouldn’t destroy the U.S. agriculture, construction and hospitality industries. They felt encouraged by Trump’s recent statement that “we’re going to take care of our farmers and hotel workers,” and his claim that he’s working on deportation exemptions for whole classes of immigrant workers who don’t have authorization, but on whom U.S. industries rely.
But the Stephen Miller wing of the administration doesn’t care about any of that. 
The whole narrative promoted by Miller, Trump’s anti-immigrant deputy chief of staff, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump himself, that the U.S. is suffering an “invasion” by a large number of immigrants who commit violent crimes is nonsense. Immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. born citizens. They are an absolutely essential part of the U.S. economy. And they are loved and valued members of our communities. Most of the people the Trump administration has been rounding up have never been convicted of any crime, let alone violent crime. They are landscapers, roofers, farmworkers, students, parents driving home from work — just like the  people Trump claims he is going to protect. As the administration ramps up its program to incarcerate and deport them, with a militarized push on a scale our country has never seen, Trump is trying to have it both ways — reassuring employers that he won’t target the “good” immigrants who work for them, while peddling the lie that there are tons of “bad” immigrants who deserve to be kept in cages in an alligator-infested swamp. 
The idyllic, peaceful atmosphere in Wisconsin, where we feel far away from violent kidnappings by unidentified, masked federal agents, could change in a dramatically dark fashion once the ICE receives the tens of billions of new dollars in the Republicans’ federal budget plan. We saw the showy arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan and immigrants who, trusting the legal system, showed up for their court dates in Milwaukee. We saw the needlessly cruel forced departure of Milwaukee teacher’s aide Yessenia Ruano and her U.S.-born little girls back to El Salvador — the country Ruano fled after her brother was murdered there by gang members and where she felt her life was threatened.
With tens of billions of dollars in new money to spend and quotas to meet for its mass deportation program, ICE could begin rounding up the hardworking immigrants who keep our dairy industry going, in parts of the state that overwhelmingly vote for Republicans.
That spectacle, along with the hideous cuts to health care, education, food assistance and other programs that make life livable in Wisconsin, will surely provoke a backlash against the politicians who enabled it. Let’s hope it’s not too late.

(Photo: Tennessee Valley Authority)In a matter of minutes, the old smokestack and more recent scrubber — a tower that removes dioxide from emissions — fell like giant trees, leaving mounds of rubble as they hit the ground.
Workers set off implosions with a boom at each structure’s base on Saturday, at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Bull Run Fossil Plant. The Claxton plant opened in 1967, and TVA retired it in 2023 as part of its plans to close all its coal plants by 2035 as the agency moves “to focus on clean energy.” 
The utility has already closed some facilities to focus on clean energy and plans to replace the coal-fired plants with natural gas, nuclear and solar plants and energy efficiency measures. 
The coal plants generate about 14% of the utility’s power. But, Melissa Greene, senior manager of media for TVA said the aging coal plants were less efficient than new plants the utility could build now.
“Sometimes it’s more efficient to close one source and open another source,” she said, adding that new ones would allow people to use even more power. 
TVA has announced plans to retire one unit at Cumberland Fossil Plant in Cumberland City by the end of 2026, Kingston Fossil Plant In Kingston by the end of 2027 and a second unit at Cumberland at the end of 2028, although Adam May with TVA media relations said “the retirement of the Cumberland and Kingston units is contingent upon the construction and commissioning of replacement generation.” 
May said TVA hasn’t decided on the retirement dates for Shawnee Fossil Plant in Kentucky or Gallatin Fossil Plant near Gallatin.
The coal phase-out started before President Donald Trump’s January inauguration. The Trump Administration has since ordered expanding rather than cutting back on coal. 
Trump issued an executive order “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” in April, telling various department heads to look for and get rid of policies “that seek to transition the Nation away from coal production and electricity generation.”










We don't know if TVA's public statements really reflect their actual plans or if they're just making noise to appease the administration.


– Axel Ringe, Tennessee Sierra Club


The federal government owns the TVA corporation. While the executive order did not mention TVA, May said the utility was “carefully reviewing” it.
“TVA continues to invest in its coal fleet to sustain the reliability and resiliency of its units,” May said. “We look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration to unleash American energy.” These statements seem to contradict TVA’s announced coal phase-out by 2035, even though that date is still the official goal.
Axel Ringe, conservation chair of the Tennessee Sierra Club, said he wasn’t sure what to make of statements like this. 
“We don’t know if TVA’s public statements really reflect their actual plans or if they’re just making noise to appease the administration,” Ringe said. “They had committed to closing both the Cumberland and Kingston plants, but now they’re waffling and saying maybe they will keep them open indefinitely to ‘address increased future generation needs.’”
Another issue the Sierra Club has raised with TVA — predating the Trump administration — is its planned continued use of natural gas. For example, at the former Kingston Fossil Plant site, TVA will build an energy complex that will house at least 1,500 megawatts of combined cycle and dual fuel aeroderivative natural gas combustion turbines with 100 megawatts of battery storage. 
Tennessee Valley Authority faces a push to get greener and more transparent 

At Cumberland, TVA is building over 1,400 megawatts of natural gas to be operational by the end of 2026. While the utility plans to invest more in solar power —for example, building a solar field in Kingston generating four megawatts—Ringe and the Tennessee Sierra Club chapter have advocated for even more renewable energy and less use of fossil fuels. 
Ringe said that use of renewable energy would not just cut back on greenhouse gasses and improve health and safety but also reduce costs. TVA, however, has argued that using natural gas rather than coal reduces pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon.
As for the Bull Run Fossil Plant site, TVA has floated many ideas, but May said it is currently only committing to two small-scale ones. The company Type One Energy will use part of the old plant’s office for an experiment which will not generate power but may pave the way for future fusion plants. A synchronous condenser which helps keep the overall grid’s power stable without generating power itself will use the old plant’s turbine. 
The utility has made no announcements about the rest of its grounds, however, specifically its coal ash storage locations. Ringe pointed out that the executive order on coal, combined with the Environmental Protection Agency’s deregulations may mean less restrictions on toxic coal ash, an issue that grabbed national attention due to the catastrophic Kingston coal ash spill in 2008. 
However, he pointed out TVA still must follow a 2015 Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Order to clean up the ash.
“At this point, it is hard to predict what TVA will do to deal with its active and legacy coal ash deposits,” he said. “We wait and see.”

One would allow districts to make their own policies. The other would ban cellphone use in class. (Amy Zimmer / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
At the beginning of the year, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer asked Michigan lawmakers for a bill that will limit students’ cellphone use to improve learning outcomes after the state ranked 44th in the nation for fourth grade reading.
With two months to go before school starts for many districts in the state, there are two proposals.
One – sponsored by Democrats in the Senate – would essentially continue to allow school systems to decide their own policies. The other – sponsored by Republicans in the House – would have more specific requirements for districts to prohibit cellphone use during instructional time in all grades.
“The governor will work with anyone to ensure our students can focus on learning, and we will closely review legislation as it makes its way to our desk,” Stacey LaRouche, Whitmer’s press secretary, said this week.
Republican State Rep. Mark Tisdel, who introduced the more prescriptive bill, told Chalkbeat his goal is for new cellphone rules to be in place before the start of the 2025-26 school year.
Tisdel said both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the governor, have similar objectives and are working on the details of what will be enacted into law.
“We’re all working in the same direction,” he said.
 Here’s what the two bills propose

  Credit: Thomas Wilburn / Chalkbeat
Senate Bill 234, introduced by Democratic State Sen. Dayna Polehanki, would only require school boards to adopt policies that “seek to limit” student cellphone use on school grounds, but would leave the specific rules to the districts.
“I believe that each school district should be able to devise a policy that is right for the school community it serves, which is why my legislation provides flexibility for schools to create plans that best suit their needs,” Polehanki said at an April 22 committee meeting when the bill was introduced.
A staff member from Polehanki’s office told Chalkbeat they could not comment on whether that is still Polehanki’s position.
The bill passed May 6 in the Senate. It has not yet been taken up in the House.
House Bill 4141 would require every district in the state to ban students from using electronic communication devices during instructional time, with some exceptions.
Additionally, elementary and middle schoolers would not be allowed to use cellphones during recess, breaks, or lunch.
The bill unanimously passed on May 14 in the House Education and Workforce Committee, including support from the three Democrats on the committee. The full House has not yet voted on the bill.
Tisdel said less restrictive laws similar to Polehanki’s were passed in states like California and Ohio. California has since replaced its law with a ban. The Ohio legislature is currently considering a ban as well.
“Why don’t we skip that part and go the direction most states end up going anyway?” he said.
At least eight states have enacted bans or restrictions on student cellphone use during class. Many local Michigan districts also have put restrictions in place.
Though supporters of the restrictions cite anecdotal evidence that they have positive results, there is limited empirical evidence and new research on outcomes vary.
Tisdel said he’s been working on his bill for two years.
“I’d like to see it implemented as quickly as possible,” he said.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Do you remember when the Republican Party was known as the party of fiscal responsibility? Do you remember when Donald Trump promised that he would drain the swamp? Do you remember when the Republicans bragged about being the party of the working people? 
Well, those days are over, and those campaign-trail promises, as it turns out, had the short life span of a gnat. On Tuesday, after 23 hours of debate, the Republican Senate passed a bill that cuts taxes by $4.5 trillion, increases the national debt by at least $3.3 trillion, while cutting funding for low-income working Americans, children, and veterans by $1 billion.
US Senate narrowly passes GOP megabill after overnight session, sending it to House

The so-called “big, beautiful” only passed with the vote of Vice President J.D. Vance who broke a 50-50 tie. Three Republicans — U.S. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — voted against the bill, along with all Democratic senators. 
The “big, beautiful” bill is a betrayal of the working people of America as it gives most of the tax cuts to the richest Americans who already control 70 percent of the wealth in the country, according to Statista, a global business data company. In short, “the big, beautiful” bill turns Robinhood on his head – it takes money from the working people of America and gives it to the richest in the largest shift of wealth in American history.
In 2027, 68 percent of the tax cuts will go to the top 20 percent of American households, while 9 percent of the cuts will go to the middle class, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan congressional committee that since 1926 has kept the scorecard on tax policy. 
Ken Smetters, a researcher at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that the school’s analysis shows the top 10 percent of income holders will receive $3.1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. 
And it’s not like they need it. Just over the past year the wealth of the 10 richest men in America, and they are all men, increased by $365 billion, a remarkable $1 billion a day increase, CNN reported in May. 
 How will the Republicans’ reconciliation package affect programs in Idaho?

Meanwhile, the “big, beautiful” bill cuts at least $800 billion from the Medicaid budget, which one out of every five Idahoans depend upon for their health insurance and rural hospitals depend on to survive. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says it will kick 12 million people off Medicaid over the next 10 years. 
And one wonders if the party of “family values” also realizes that half of all births in Idaho and at least 40 percent of births in other states are paid for by Medicaid. How will those families pay for the birth of their children if they lose their Medicaid services? 
The “big, beautiful” bill will cut another $300 billion – 30 percent – from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program which feeds millions of low-income children and senior citizens. 
Idaho runs SNAP efficiently, officials say. But Congress might make state pay millions more.

Ironically, these cuts could shift much of the cost of these programs back to Idaho if lawmakers choose to keep programs at their current level. This means any benefit average Idahoans might see in their federal taxes will be offset by increased taxes at the state level. And the timing is bad because we already know Idaho’s tax revenue isn’t coming in as expected and Gov. Brad Little is looking at budget cuts of up to 6 percent. 
Idahoans may also be shocked when their rural hospital closes because of the Medicaid cuts. Political historian Heather Cox Richardson over the weekend quoted Politico as saying every major health system in Louisiana is warning House Speaker Mike Johnson that the “big, beautiful” bill’s cuts to Medicaid “would be historic in their devastation.” 
 How will the reconciliation bill affect the federal debt?

And even budget hawks should be screeching over the bill. It will add $4.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, including interest payments on the debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is a debt that our children and grandchildren will be stuck paying off, with interest, for decades to come. 
After the bill passed, Elon Musk took to social media to chastise senators like Idaho’s Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo who have always criticized government spending. He said those senators “should hang their heads in shame” for supporting a bill that adds trillions to the national debt.
But Crapo will probably tell Idahoans that the bill only adds about $400 billion to the debt. That’s because he got a provision in the bill that includes an accounting sleight of hand called “current policy guidelines” that tries to hide the real increase to the debt.
But, as much as Crapo wants you to think that two, plus two equals zero, mathematics, unlike politicians, can’t lie. When you give trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy you are going to run up the national debt. 
Donald Trump and Republican supporters of the “big, beautiful” bill say that it will pay for itself with a boost to the economy. But that’s not true. Even the conservative Tax Foundation says that it will add only 0.1 percent per year on average over the next decade to the Gross National Product (GNP), thus erasing only about 19 percent of the bill’s impact on the national debt. Wharton School pegs the GNP growth even lower, a measly 0.5 percent over 10 years and 1.7 percent over 30 years. 
Americans are not stupid. They see what the president and Congress are doing. A survey by the nonprofit KFF in early June shows that 64 percent of Americans oppose the “big, beautiful” tax cut. That same survey shows that Americans support Medicaid by a whopping 83 percent.
Even some Republicans fear what the “big, beautiful” bill will do to their political future. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says the cuts to Medicaid are “morally wrong and politically suicidal,” even though he ended up voting for the bill. Sen. Thom Tillis says that voters will punish Republicans at the polls. Tony Fabrizio, who conducts polling for Trump, warns that voters have “no appetite” for the Medicaid cuts.
Other senators say their colleagues are overreacting – the Medicaid cuts and tax cuts for the rich will have no impact on voters. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his colleagues that voters will “get over it,” according to Punchbowl News. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said Medicaid voters should not worry about the cuts, adding “we are all going to die.”
 Voters and identity politics v. actual policy

Donald Trump is betting that his true-blue supporters, which make up many of the voters who receive Medicaid benefits, will forget that he is cutting their health care, while providing tax cuts to the wealthy. And he may be right.
A study by Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, conducted a study that showed that rural hospital closures decreased when state legislatures expanded Medicaid, as voters did in Idaho. Meanwhile, hospital closures increased in red states where lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid. 
Yet Shepherd’s study showed that in communities that lost their hospital, support for Republicans increased 10-15 percent. 
Larry Bartels, a professor at Vanderbilt University, explained such a dichotomy by saying voters make decisions more on “identity” politics than on political “policy” decisions. In other words, when Donald Trump promises to “drain the swamp” they will vote for him even if they lose their health care in the process, while the swamp isn’t drained. 
But one wonders if that will remain true when most voters see that the president and the Republican Congress are making a clear choice to favor the rich over working people, while betraying the party’s long-standing claim that they balance the budget just the same way American families do. 
It also might not be lost on many Americans that over the past weekend, when the Senate worked overtime to pass the “big, beautiful” bill, the second richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, got married in Venice. The wedding, which included 200 guests like fellow billionaire Bill Gates, cost $20 million, 600 times the cost of the average American wedding, according to Forbes. 
The 2025 “big beautiful” tax bill will likely make Bezos’ Amazon company even more profitable. The first four years after Trump’s last “big, beautiful” tax cut went into effect in 2017 Amazon’s effective tax rates was 5 percent, about four times lower than what the average American pays in income taxes, according to The Nation magazine. 
If the Republicans and the president really cared for the average American, if they really supported working people, they would have cut fewer programs these citizens rely on and targeted most of the tax cuts to the middle class. This would have put money in the pockets of families who need it most and add nothing to the national debt because the wealthiest Americans, who often avoid taxes thanks to highly paid accountants, would pay more of their fair share. 
Americans must be starting to ask themselves: The president and Republican Congress are looking out for the millionaires and billionaires, but who is looking out for us? 
This time Idahoans, who overwhelmingly voted for Trump, may well see that the president and Congress are not draining the swamp – they are taking a pleasant swim in it. And, for them, and their wealthy benefactors, the water feels just fine.

“Most pharmacies were just hanging on for Senate Bill 188,” said independent pharmacist Rosemary Smith, referring to the 2024 legislation sponsored by Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, meant to strengthen state regulation of PBMs.
The new law — passed with overwhelming support by the legislature and signed into law by Gov. Andy Beshear last year — takes aim at the role of PBMs in commercial health plans, such as those purchased by individuals or provided by employers.
But a year later, it has stalled, with Beshear’s Department of Insurance claiming it can’t enforce parts of it because of a conflict with federal law that regulates commercial insurance plans.

As a result, the PBMs — national companies, some owned by pharmacy chains including CVS, the nation’s largest — continue to control a significant portion of the prescription drug market, said Smith, co-founder of the Kentucky Independent Pharmacists Alliance.
“It’s a system totally controlled by the PBMs,” Smith said.
On its website, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents PBMs, defends the industry. It argues that PBMs improve efficiency and save consumers money through processing prescription claims, negotiating drug prices and reimbursing pharmacies.
“Pharmacy Benefit Companies (PBMs) are your advocates in the health care system, working to lower prescription drug costs for patients and payers,” it said.
But the PBM industry has come under fire from consumer advocates at the state and federal level. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission released a scathing report suggesting that PBMs are “profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.”
And critics, including Wise, the Kentucky Senate majority leader, argue PBMs continue to squeeze small pharmacies by slashing payments and steering business away from community drugstores to their own chain stores or mail order houses.
SB 188 follows a 2020 law, also sponsored by Wise, that cut PBMs out of the state’s substantial Medicaid prescription drug business, which the state said has saved it millions of dollars.
“We had great success with Medicaid, but with the commercial side, we’ve hit a roadblock,” Wise said.
Kentucky ‘an outlier’
Frustrated by what he said is the state’s failure to enforce portions of his 2024 bill, Wise has asked Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman for an opinion on whether the Beshear administration is correct in claiming it is restricted by federal law.
“Other states, including neighboring states, have passed legislation similar to Senate Bill 188 and are enforcing all provisions of the law,” said Wise’s June 19 letter seeking an attorney general’s opinion. “It appears Kentucky’s (Insurance Department) is an outlier in its interpretation of the laws.”
States that have enacted similar laws include West Virginia and Tennessee, his letter said.
In an interview, Wise said he doesn’t understand Kentucky’s reluctance to fully enforce the law.
  Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark
“It looks like other states, they’re proceeding just fine,” he said.
In a recent bulletin, Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark cites federal court decisions from several jurisdictions. But, Smith said, none apply to Kentucky.
Coleman’s office has received the request and is researching an opinion, spokesman Kevin Grout said.
The Kentucky Department of Insurance is the agency authorized to enforce SB 188.
Asked for comment, a department spokesperson referred a reporter to the bulletin from Commissioner Clark posted on its website Monday outlining the department’s position.
In it, Clark agrees the department can enforce a provision that sets a baseline for reimbursement paid by PBMs to pharmacists per prescription, which already is in effect and which pharmacists say has provided some relief.
But Kentucky insurance officials insist that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prevents it from enforcing some other provisions of the law affecting commercial health insurance plans including limiting the ability of PBMs to “steer”  prescriptions to their own entities.
The “anti-steering provisions” of SB 188 “are pre-empted by federal law,” the bulletin said. 
Wise and others — including a Washington D.C. lawyer hired by the independent pharmacists and the Kentucky Pharmacists Association — disagree.
“We respectfully believe this interpretation is incorrect and urge your administration to reconsider,” said the letter to Beshear from Washington lawyer Robert T. Smith.
Rosemary Smith, the independent pharmacist, said the department’s bulletin leaves too many questions unanswered.
“It’s still not clear what this does for the pharmacy community,” she said
Meanwhile in Kentucky, delay in enforcement has added to financial stress on the about 500 independent pharmacies across the state, likely costing them “hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Rosemary Smith said.
In the past two years, 98 independent drugstores have closed, mostly from financial pressures.
“It’s a crazy business,” said Smith, who with her husband, Luther, owns six community drugstores in Eastern Kentucky.
Medicaid ‘a saving grace’
In 2020, amid growing complaints from Kentucky pharmacists, the General Assembly enacted Wise’s Senate Bill 50, which eliminated the role of PBMs as subcontractors to the multiple national health insurance companies that manage most of Kentucky’s $18 billion a year Medicaid program.
Reprieve for Kentucky’s independent pharmacies is saving Medicaid millions

Medicaid, which in Kentucky gets about 80% of its funds from the federal government, provides health coverage for about 1.4 million individuals, most low-income or with disabilities.
Under Wise’s bill, the state Medicaid Department hired its own single entity to manage prescription drug claims and set minimum reimbursement levels for pharmacists.
The bill helped pharmacists financially and saved the state about $283 million in its first two years, state officials told lawmakers in 2023, largely in proceeds previously collected by PBMs.
Because Medicaid is so huge — it covers nearly one-third of Kentucky’s population and spends about $3 billion a year on prescription drugs — it has been a  lifeline for pharmacists, Rosemary Smith said.
“Medicaid, that’s been a saving grace for us,” she said.
But she and Wise, the sponsor of the new law, said PBM reforms also are needed for the commercial health insurance market in Kentucky.
Wise said he’s hoping a favorable opinion from the attorney general will remove any roadblocks from full enforcement of the new law.
While the complexities of the prescription drug industry might seem “wonky” to most Kentuckians, they do understand when the cost of their prescriptions increase and local pharmacies close. “That’s when you have a large number of Kentuckians upset,” he said.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Though lawmakers made progress in addressing Maine’s growing waste problem, activists and advocates were hoping for more. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge Landfill that sits between Old Town and Alton. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. Last fall, the state signaled its support for expanding the facility, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028, despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
More than half a dozen bills were introduced this past legislative session seeking to address relations between the landfill and its neighbors, as well as the waste itself as Juniper Ridge inches closer to capacity. 
Overall, Old Town resident Ed Spencer said he is “somewhat disappointed” in the work that was done in Augusta this year regarding the landfill he lives less than two miles from. Spencer is part of the grassroots movement Don’t Waste ME, which advocates for policies to protect the health of communities at risk of disposal operations, and attended multiple of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee meetings. 
Without action, Old Town residents worry town will be ‘sacrifice zone’ to Juniper Ridge

In early May, Spencer joined more than 50 others for a rally in Old Town to not only voice their concerns about expanding the state’s largest landfill, but also to ask the lawmakers to back bills that could address the contamination and injustice they feel local communities have endured. 
Though he was pleased with the outcome of some bills, Spencer said he is especially disappointed that LD 297 passed and was signed into law by Gov. Janet Mills. Proponents argued the bill was necessary to allow more bulky waste to be brought in to stabilize the sludge that is disposed of at the facility. However, Spencer fears it just opens the door for more out-of-state waste to fill the landfill even faster.
If that legislation didn’t pass, Spencer said he may have felt more positive about the progress this session, but “that bill is a real stinker.”
Spencer said he also hoped for the passage of LD 1349, which sought to require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge, which would have increased oversight.
The Legislature did pass a measure (LD 1782) directing the Bureau of General Services to work with the landfill contract operator and the city of Old Town to ensure that the city is “fairly and adequately compensated for the burden of hosting” the landfill. 
Despite what Spencer sees as losses, he applauded the passage of two other waste-related bills. 
“We learned it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon,” he said. “As hard as it is to compromise, sometimes we have to accept what victories we can get.”
He was pleased that the governor signed LD 1604 into law to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. While Spencer wished the Environment and Natural Resources Committee kept language in the bill that would have imposed limits on how much leachate waste that treatment plants could discharge, he still thinks of it as a success, especially for homeowners next to landfills who will be able to have their water tested for PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
Spencer is also celebrating passage of a food waste ban, which he described as a “total victory.” That bill became law with the endorsement of Mills’ signature bringing Maine in line with every other New England state that already has a so-called food waste ban on the books. The law will prohibit significant generators of food waste, which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others, from disposing of food waste if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. 
“The state of Maine needs to continue to push for real zero-waste solutions” like LD 1065, said Dana Colihan, co-executive director of Slingshot, a community organizing group focused on environmental threats.

Andy Beshear signs a proclamation in the Capitol Rotunda making October 2024 Domestic Violence Awareness Month in Kentucky. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)If you or someone you know has experienced domestic violence, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. You can also contact any of Kentucky’s 15 domestic violence programs. 
Most perpetrators and victims of domestic violence in Kentucky are between the ages of 25 and 39, the annual Domestic Violence Data Report shows. 
The 2024 report, released Monday, shows about 9% of domestic violence perpetrators are between the ages of 13 and 17. 
Olivia Spradlin, a policy expert at ZeroV, (formerly known as the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence), said that while ZeroV staff are still examining the report, that 9% data point stood out. 
“Oftentimes we talk about children living in domestic violence and witnessing it and getting in between parents,” Spradlin said. “That number, I think, stood out to us, though, from an aspect of: these are children who are already committing intimate partner violence. That feels like an area to think more about, in terms of prevention and healthy dating.” 
Kentucky also has high rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which are traumas a person experiences before turning 18. Research published in the National Library of Medicine in 2022 suggests a link between experiencing trauma and violent behavior. 
“While risk factors can be linked to a greater likelihood of using violence, they are not necessarily direct causes,” Spradlin said. “The DV data report does not have information that can speak to those risk and protective factors; that is an area that would need more inquiry.” 
  The report shows most domestic violence perpetrators are men and most victims are women. About 9% of domestic violence perpetrators are between the ages of 13 and 17.  (Screenshot)
The report also shows most domestic violence perpetrators are men and most victims are women. Of Kentuckians who sought a protective order, the report shows 69% received some type of order and 21% were denied. 
The state began gathering this data in compliance with a 2022 Republican bill that directed agencies to annually gather and publish data on domestic and dating violence and abuse. 
Data in it comes from the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet’s Criminal Justice Statistical Analysis Center, Kentucky State Police, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Administrative Office of the Courts.
At least 44.5% of women and 32.9% of men in Kentucky have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime, according to the report. 
“In Kentucky, while progress continues, challenges remain, particularly when analyzing data sourced from multiple systems designed for varying purposes,” the report says. 
Those challenges include different organizations using different terminology and definitions and the lack of a “formal statewide surveillance system” to identify domestic violence deaths. 
Because of that gap, “this report cannot provide a definitive count of Kentuckians who have died due to domestic or dating violence,” it says. 
“Far too many Kentuckians experience domestic violence,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. “That’s why it has been a top priority of my administration to make our commonwealth a safer place for all our families, and to make sure victim services are available across the commonwealth. Through working with partners, we are able to help Kentuckians in need while working together to bring justice.”
By the numbers 
  Of Kentuckians who sought a protective order, the report shows 69% received some type of order and 21% were denied. (Screenshot)
The report shows that in Kentucky last year: 

32,899 electronic JC-3 forms (documenting alleged violence) were filed. This is a small increase from 2023, when  32,885 were filed. 
Those reports resulted in 7,964 arrests, an increase from 7,759 the year prior. 
Despite more arrests, some convictions were down. 
There were 4,088 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault, a decrease from 4,196 in 2023. 
There were 100 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault by offenders facing their third or offense in five years. That is a 9% decrease from 2023, when there were 110 such convictions. 
There were 82 convictions of 2nd Degree Domestic Violence Assault, down from 105 in 2023. 
There were 12 convictions for 1st Degree Domestic Violence Assault, the same as in 2023. 
There were 17,023 emergency protective orders (EPO) and temporary interpersonal protective orders (TIPO) served in 2024, down from 17,036 in 2023. 
There were 14,187 reports of alleged child abuse/neglect to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) that also included intimate partner violence. 
More people got services from ZeroV’s 15 programs — 15, 386 in 2024 compared with 15,104 in 2023. 

Policy opportunities 
In 2024, a Northern Kentucky Republican unsuccessfully tried to pass a law that would have given victims of coercive control access to  protective orders without first having to experience physical violence or face immediate threat of physical violence. Coercive control is a more nuanced type of abuse in which one person exerts control over another through isolation, threats, surveillance, loss of financial freedom and medical access and more.  
The report acknowledges that “not all harmful or abusive behavior meets the threshold for criminal charges or protective orders.”
“Behaviors such as restricting access to privacy or sleep, micromanaging daily activities, threatening suicide or consistently undermining one’s parenting are profoundly damaging,” but  “may not be recognized as domestic violence in a legal context.” 
Spradlin said ZeroV “has supported adding coercive control to protective orders” but “we would remain very attentive to the implementation process for unintended consequences.” 
She said accessing housing is also a “huge barrier” for survivors of domestic violence. 
“Housing, right now, is a huge issue for survivors — and affordable housing and dignified housing and housing that folks want to live in,” she said. “If a survivor can’t find housing, they can’t financially support themselves when they leave.”

Mazza/iStock/Getty Images)A group of environmentalists have launched a legal battle to stop a logging project in the Sandwich Range of New Hampshire’s White Mountain National Forest.
The Sandwich Vegetation Management Project, which was approved by the U.S. Forest Service last year, will allow 638 acres in the Sandwich Range to be logged by private companies, reconstruct about 16 miles of roads through the area and authorize prescribed burns on 306 acres. The Forest Service has said that the project will help manage vegetation to provide a sustainable supply of timber for local economies and the burns will help diversify vegetation and wildlife. It’s one of several logging projects in the White Mountain National Forest, several of which are being challenged in court.
“The Forest Service in this project, like in recent projects, is flouting the requirements of federal law as they approve these significant logging projects across the White Mountains,” Christophe Courchese, the attorney behind the lawsuit, said in an interview with the Bulletin. “And they’re doing less than the bare minimum required reviews of these pretty significant efforts that will really change the face of these areas for decades to come.”
The Sandwich Range Wilderness spans about 35,300 acres within the southern portion of the national forest. It includes Mount Passaconaway, Mount Tripyramid, Sandwich Mountain, several rivers, and about 60 miles of hiking trails. 
An allegedly ‘shoddy’ process
In a lawsuit filed in late June, Standing Trees, Inc. — a Vermont environmental group that seeks to protect forests across New England — and attorneys with the Environmental Advocacy Clinic — a project of the Vermont Law and Graduate School — allege the Forest Service didn’t sufficiently prove logging was necessary in the area or go through the proper steps for environmental review and public input.
“If you go down the list of various resources that they were supposed to analyze, and you really look carefully at what they put together, what you see is a pattern of the Forest Service just concluding, without evidence, that the project will have no impact on those resources,” Courchese, who serves as director of the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said. “And that doesn’t meet the requirements of federal law.”
The lawsuit argues the project runs counter to guidelines outlined in a plan for the forest established by the federal government in 2005 called the White Mountain National Forest Plan. It claims the project fails to comply with that plan because it doesn’t include any measures to protect the officially designated wild and scenic Cold River and will affect parts of the forest visible to hikers and recreationists in violation of requirements to not impact scenery. The suit also says the Forest Service failed to demonstrate that logging will help manage vegetation and won’t harm the habitats of animals in the forest, including the northern long-eared bat, a federally listed endangered species that lives in the range.










They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn't adequate.


– Don't forget to add author


It also alleges the Forest Service plans to build four times as much mileage of roads than authorized in the 2005 plan by classifying the proposed road construction as reconstruction of existing roads. The lawsuit argues those roads have been decommissioned for so long that reforestation has occurred over them.
“The public should have a right to weigh in on these uses of federal public lands, especially, these really beautiful, important areas that have major species and other important water quality benefits and all these sorts of things that that the Forest Service was supposed to take into account,” Courchese said. “And they really did a very shoddy job in analyzing these impacts.”
The lawsuit also accuses the project of violating the National Environmental Policy Act in numerous ways including by failing the so-called “hard look” test and not properly examining the impacts on forest health, climate, and endangered species.
“They certainly went through a process, but the process wasn’t adequate, especially given the types of information that they presented and the analysis that they did in that review,” Courchese said. “So it’s not that they didn’t do any review, but the review that they did really fell short of the federal requirements.”
The Forest Service’s stance
The Forest Service has not filed a response to the lawsuit, according to online court records. Officials with the Forest Service and White Mountain National Forest’s Campton office did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. However, in a letter outlining approval for the project, Jim Innis, Saco District ranger at the national forest addressed public concern over the project, writing “The National Forest System is managed under a multiple use mission, which not everyone agrees with.”
“Public opinion on forest management has and will continue to be controversial,” he continued. “Federal land management policy can be complex and difficult to understand. My staff and I did our best to explain the ‘why’ of our management actions and will continue this approach for future projects. … I have considered public comments received throughout the analysis and balanced them with the best available science in making this decision.”
The Forest Service had three 30-day comment periods and held five public meetings and five meetings with clubs and organizations on the project.
After those meetings, the Forest Service excluded 50 acres of old-growth forests from the project, Innis wrote. He also said the agency consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which determined “the proposed project may affect, but not is likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat.”
Several contested projects
This isn’t the first time Courchese and the Environment Advocacy Clinic have sued the Forest Service. There are more than a dozen logging projects approved or proposed in the White Mountain National Forest, and the Environmental Advocacy Clinic, partnered with Standing Trees, Inc., have targeted several of them.
“We’ve been very active in this space,” Courchese said, “challenging the Forest Service and trying to hold them accountable for complying with federal law.”
That includes their lawsuit over the Tarleton Project near Gorham and Lake Tarleton in the western portion of the forest, and a lawsuit against the Peabody Project in the famous northern Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Those lawsuits are ongoing and revolve around similar disputes.
They’ve also challenged logging projects on state land in Vermont and sued chemical manufacturing giant Monsanto over its alleged harmful impacts on water in New England. 
New dynamics under Trump
The logging projects have been ongoing across multiple presidential administrations. However, when President Donald Trump retook office in January, Courchese said he noticed two major conflicting changes happening simultaneously.
“Clearly, at the presidential level and at the top of the agency, there’s a real imperative to get these logging projects going,” he said. “And there’s a real set of commands, through executive orders and other directives, to put more of these national forest lands on the chopping block, so to speak, for reasons that don’t hold up, such as the fact that we have a supposed emergency in the national forests in terms of wildfire risk, which is just not the case in the White Mountains.”
However, at the same time, he said that massive cuts in staffing and funding appear to have hamstrung the Forest Service employees’ ability to work on this quickly.
Trump has taken several actions aimed at opening up more forests to logging across the U.S. Late last month, he announced plans to end the quarter-century-old “roadless rule” and lift restrictions on road construction in nearly a third of U.S. National forest land, a necessary step to build logging infrastructure. Trump also instructed his cabinet secretaries to bypass endangered species laws and other environmental restrictions to allow loggers to tap into more areas. These actions follow a series of executive orders in early March meant to streamline timber production and bypass environmental protection laws on claims of national security and natural disaster risk.

(Screenshot from Governor’s Office X video.)Governor Josh Stein vetoed three bills Wednesday afternoon, including an expansion of the state auditor’s powers and a controversial reduction in emissions standards sought by Duke Energy.
In a slew of bill actions, Stein issued three vetoes and signed seven other bills passed by the General Assembly. The decisions bring Stein’s veto total for the term to seven, after he previously rejected bills on the permitless carry of concealed firearms, immigration enforcement, and environmental policy changes last month. That’s roughly on pace with the previous legislative session — by this point in 2023, Governor Roy Cooper had vetoed eight bills, though all were ultimately overturned.
So far, none of Stein’s vetoes have been overridden, as the legislature has a very narrow path to do so. Though Republicans hold a veto-proof, 30-20 supermajority in the state Senate, they are one seat short of the 72 votes needed in the 120-seat House, meaning any veto override would require either support from a House Democrat or absences.
Duke Energy bill
The highest-profile veto Wednesday was of Senate Bill 266, a proposal that would cut greenhouse gas emissions requirements for Duke Energy while allowing the utility monopoly to charge higher rates to fund the construction of new electric facilities.
SB 266 would eliminate a 2030 goal to reduce carbon emissions by 70% for electric companies that service more than 150,000 customers, leaving intact only a 2050 goal for carbon neutrality. It would also allow for large electric companies to raise rates to cover future generating facilities, so long as estimates show the new facilities would yield long-term savings for customers.
This bill is the most likely of the three to see a successful veto override, as it received votes from 11 House Democrats last month, meaning it already has the support of a supermajority of House representatives.
Stein took aim at the bill for its potential to raise utility costs on consumers in the short-term.










“This summer’s record heat and soaring utility bills has shown that we need to focus on lowering electricity costs for working families — not raising them. And as our state continues to grow, we need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets. Recent independent analysis of Senate Bill 266 shows that this bill could cost North Carolina ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050 due to higher fuel costs. This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive, but it also shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people — families will pay more so that industry pays less. Additionally, this bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy. My job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.”


– Governor Josh Stein


  Stein vetoed a bill on Wednesday that would relax emissions targets for Duke Energy and allow them to raise rates. (Screenshot from Governor’s Office X video.)
In a statement issued following the veto, a Dan Crawford of the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters praised Stein for rejecting what he called a false choice between low costs and clean power, a trade-off he said, that represented “a scam pushed by wealthy utilities to protect their profits at the expense of our communities.”
“Governor Stein continues to stand up for hardworking North Carolinians against Duke Energy’s greed,” said Crawford, the NCLCV’s director of government relations. “Senate Bill 266 would have raised residential energy bills, put ratepayers on the hook for Duke’s expansion, and gutted a key state climate goal — cutting carbon emissions 70% by 2030. An independent study found removing this target goal would cost ratepayers an additional $23 billion by 2050.”
A spokesperson for Duke Energy did not respond to a request for comment.
Republican legislative leaders in the House and Senate bashed Stein’s veto decision, with Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger labeling him a “Green New Deal Radical,” arguing that the bill would in fact save North Carolinians $15 billion in electric costs. House Speaker Destin Hall said in a statement that he expects a veto override to succeed.
“I’m disappointed in the governor’s veto of the ‘Power Bill Reduction Act,’ which would have delivered cheap, reliable energy to North Carolina, cut the red tape that is choking innovation and long-term energy solutions, and saved consumers over $12 billion dollars,” Hall said. “Considering the strong bipartisan support in both chambers, we anticipate overriding this veto.”
An analysis posted June 30th by researchers at NC State University said that the bill would lead to a $23 billion increase in fuel costs through 2050.
State auditor bill
A bill whose fate would appear cloudier is House Bill 549, which would grant broad investigative powers into any entity receiving state or federal funding to the State Auditor’s Office, while also exempting the office from several state requirements.
HB 549 comes as Auditor Dave Boliek has received broad new grants of authority from the state legislature, including oversight of the State Board of Elections, a shift that flipped the board from control by a Democratic majority to a Republican one. Stein cited the state’s commercial interests as a chief reason for vetoing the bill.










“House Bill 549 would grant the Auditor sweeping access to the data and records of any private corporation that accepts any amount of state funding. Giving the Auditor this intrusive power may undermine our state’s efforts to recruit businesses to North Carolina. Additionally, the bill would remove the Office of State Auditor from the state’s cybersecurity efforts led by the Department of Information Technology, putting North Carolinians’ personal identifying information at heightened risk of a breach.”


– Governor Josh Stein


Though state legislative leaders did not address the bill’s veto, Boliek said in a statement that Stein’s veto undermines the “autonomy and independence” of the state auditor’s office, citing a need for greater latitude to perform its watchdog function.

“Governor Stein’s veto undercuts the important principles of accountability and transparency that taxpayers expect from their government,” Boliek said. “Further, as the governor is aware, our office already has the authority to hold those who receive tax dollars accountable. I have confidence the legislature will stand up for these principles and override the governor’s veto.”
If the legislature attempts to override Stein’s veto of HB 549, it will likely face a narrow path to success. Only a single House Democrat, Rep. Shelly Willingham of Edgecombe County, voted to concur with the Senate’s passage of the bill in June, after having previously voted against it in May. To overcome the veto, Republicans will need to retain his support while ensuring full attendance from their own caucus.
Charter school bill
In his third veto of the day, Stein rejected Senate Bill 254, an overhaul of charter school laws in the state that would delegate greater authority to the state’s Charter Schools Review Board, including allowing it to reject State Board of Education rules that would apply to charter schools.
Stein wrote in his veto statement that giving the CSRB the authority to overrule the State Board of Education would violate the North Carolina state constitution.










“Senate Bill 254 is an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Additionally, it weakens accountability of charter schools when every North Carolina student deserves excellent public schools, whether traditional or charter.”


– Governor Josh Stein


Objecting to the veto, the North Carolina Coalition for Charter Schools issued a statement arguing that charter schools in the state require greater independence and flexibility to operate than is currently provided.
  If passed, S.B. 254 would allow the Charter School Review Board to overrule State Superintendent of Public Instruction Maurice “Mo” Green and the Board of Education on charter school policies. (Screengrab from education forum hosted by WRAL)
“The success of public charter schools hinges on their flexibility and autonomy,” said Dave Machado, the coalition’s executive director. “The legislature rightly placed at the front line of charter schools regulation and oversight a body of public charter school experts insulated from political maneuverings that have hamstrung the charter school sector in other states.”
Machado also disputed that the state constitution prevents this change, noting that the clause empowering the State Board of Education states that its authority is “subject to laws enacted by the General Assembly.”
As with the energy bill, supporters of SB 254 appear at first blush to have sufficient numbers to override the governor’s veto. Eight Democrats joined with Republicans to pass the bill in the House, more than enough to provide a supermajority vote.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Virginia and other states will regain the ability to use $33 million in emergency relief funds, after the federal government last week reversed course on a March decision that prohibited them from using the funds.
U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon abruptly accelerated the deadline for schools to spend all allocated funds  on March 28, leaving schools scrambling to make plans for the money. 
McMahon announced the rescission of that policy in a June 26 letter to chief state school officers, after several states sued the agency in the Southern District of New York, leading to injunctions that prevented the DOE from enforcing its policy. Virginia was not one of those states involved in the litigation, but its state education agency did file appeals with DOE.
The Virginia Department of Education said DOE’s announcement will unlock a total of $52 million for Virginia, including $26.3 million for state-level projects and $25.7 million for school projects. The state education department previously received an extension for $18 million for statewide tutoring services. 
“The original intent of the policy announced on March 28 was to treat all states consistently with regards to safeguarding and refocusing their remaining COVID-era grant funding on students,” wrote McMahon. 
She said that, given the ongoing litigation against the policy, states can submit reimbursement or route pay requests for their Education Stabilization Funds programs. The agency will review requests and evaluate them consistent with the prior process. 
McMahon wrote that states that have already submitted requests and receipts as part of the review and appeals process do not need to resubmit.
Beginning in 2020, states, including Virginia, received millions in grants through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations and the American Rescue Plan Acts. 
Schools have used the funds to support safe operations for students and staff, and address the pandemic’s negative impacts on learning with tools such as tutoring and after-school programs.
Although the federal government extended the deadline to use the grant funds under President Joe Biden’s administration, schools were required to return all unspent funds, which were intended for immediate and short-term needs.
“We continue to work closely with impacted school divisions to ensure their reimbursements are submitted to USED to close out the ESSER III projects and funding,” VDOE said in a statement. “The continued use of the funding through the original approved late liquidation period will allow school divisions and the state to complete projects that were either almost completed or well underway.”

The state is showing a dedication to sustainable farming measures by allocating $223 million for agricultural practices that stop pollutants and sediment disturbances that lead to runoff into the Chesapeake Bay.
It is a $16 million increase over the last fiscal year, leading to the fourth year of increasing funding from the state. The program helps farmers in the commonwealth to implement projects that conserve water, help soil health through cover crops, and other sustainability goals. It is part of a larger, multistate effort to improve the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay.
“This unprecedented funding underscores Virginia’s strong commitment to environmental stewardship and agricultural resilience,” said Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon in a statement. “Investing in voluntary conservation practices is one of the most effective ways we can protect our waterways, support farmers and meet our Chesapeake Bay restoration goals.”
Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in fiscal year 2026 to cost-share one of over 60 projects, including stream cattle exclusion zones, cover crops, and animal waste control facilities. 
“So sometimes they would be implementing a practice, but this is kind of taking their practice to the next level from a work party perspective, and the payment structure is set up in a way to try and incentivize or offset the financial disadvantage of implementing rye over a legume for example,” said James Martin, Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s division of soil and water conservation. Rye is less attractive to farmers as a cover crop because it spreads into other crops.
Martin said it is important to bring farmers to the table on these goals because they understand it is a cost to them to implement these projects. He said he has been pleased with the General Assembly’s investment in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.
“If we fail to meet our agricultural commitments in the Chesapeake Bay by 2027 there’s a possibility that the secretaries of agriculture and the secretaries of natural resources would mandate the implementation of nutrient management on crops,” Martin said.
Over a decade ago, Virginia joined other states in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Later, the General Assembly implemented a law that beefed up the requirements for the state to reduce its amount of pollutants running out of its waterways into the Bay. 
There are questions around how the agreement will be impacted with the Trump administration proposing major cuts to the EPA. After a brief funding pause, many of the dollars already allocated by Congress were released to the Bay cleanup programs. It is uncertain what the budget for the projects will be in the next year.
Farmers are able to apply for the state conservation funds through their local soil and water conservation districts.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced the National Institutes of Health is limiting indirect-cost funding to 15%, but this has been blocked by a federal judge. 
“We’re going to lose people from Ohio to other states that might have more resources in the space that don’t rely as much on federal funding,” said Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors. 
“That is part of the ripple effect as well. We are going to lose faculty members. We’re going to see a decrease in research production at our institutions. … This is going to set back advancements in medicine, advancements, and all other kinds of fields potentially for decades.” 
More than 1,600 National Science Foundation grants totaling more than $1.5 billion in research investments have been eliminated since April, according to Grant Watch. 
National Institutes of Health cuts
Ohio’s seven Research 1 universities could lose more than $106 million through NIH cuts, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 

Ohio State University could lose nearly $50 million. 
Case Western Reserve University could lose nearly $39 million.
The University of Cincinnati could lose nearly $16 million. 
Kent State University could lose about $1 million.
Ohio University could lose about $662,000.
The University of Toledo could lose about $518,000.
The University of Dayton could lose $148,000 

“Recent federal government directives have had an immense impact on our university, especially on research funding and, consequently and unfortunately, on many teams,” Case Western Reserve University said in a statement. 
“We are grateful for the research support we receive from our federal partners as these investments literally save lives right here in Ohio,” said Ohio State Spokesperson Ben Johnson. “We are closely monitoring and managing federal notifications that have impacted a number of our faculty and laboratories.”
The NIH funding cuts were projected to be almost half a billion dollars in Ohio, Kilpatrick said. 
“Shutting down this money is going to have grave consequences,” she said. “It’s going to make not just Ohio weaker, but the entire country weaker because we have always been at the forefront of research development, of scientific discovery, so we are putting ourselves in a weaker position globally by having these kinds of research cuts.”
NASA and National Science Foundation funding 
Ohio State University’s Astronomy Chair Todd Thompson is waiting to see what will happen with the funding. 
“If those were to go forward, there would be very substantial reductions in our ability to get grants,” he said. “Those grants fund our graduate students, and they also fund some aspects of our undergraduate research program.”
The Ohio State Astronomy Department has 30 graduate students and slightly more than half of them are funded through federal grants, he said.  
“If you decrease that funding by a factor of three, then there you go,” Thompson said. “That would basically almost eliminate our ability to fund graduate students off of grants.”
Ohio State Spokesperson Chris Booker said “it would be premature to comment at this point in the process” when asked how these potential cuts could affect the astronomy department.
The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is the next flagship mission for NASA — something the Ohio State Astronomy Department is heavily involved in — but the White House’s proposed 2026 NASA budget would cut its funding in half. The telescope is almost fully built and is scheduled to launch in October 2026, Thompson said. 
“You have a mission that’s basically ready, you want to launch it, you want to get data,” he said. “You want to figure out new things about the universe. … The idea that it wouldn’t go forward, or that it would be very substantially hampered by a lower budget, by lower operating costs are all bad for science, all bad for training students in science.” 
The funding cuts would be devastating for all the astronomy programs across the country, Thompson said. 
“We would not be able to train students, which means that we would not be able to do as much research which means that we would not be putting in this steady pipeline of highly trained, very agile and very able students into the workforce to do these types of things, and we also would not produce the type of science that you see,” he said. 
That means the pace of new space discoveries — ranging from new galaxies to black holes — would substantially decrease, Thompson said. 
Scientific discoveries by Americans will slow down, said Ohio State Astronomy Professor David Weinberg. 
“Americans have become used to a steady stream of medical miracles that cure previously fatal diseases, advances in physics and chemistry that produce astonishing new technologies, and Nobel-Prize winning discoveries that rewrite our understanding of nature,” he said. “If things proceed along the administration’s proposed path, then that era is basically over.”

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of the state along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
Hard to thrive
Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.
In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.

Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
‘The tremble factors’
While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”

Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.
Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
‘Take a step back’
People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In 1996, women from both sides of the strife tearing apart Northern Ireland, then divided along ethno-nationalist lines, formed a political party to advocate for inclusion and human rights in upcoming peace talks. Only the top 10 vote-getting parties would be part of the talks. Though they organized only six weeks in advance of the election, the women’s party came in ninth out of 24.
Their remarkable success was attributed to keeping their message simple: inclusion, human rights and equality. They also urged “transversal politics,” meaning members could keep their own identity and views on various issues while respecting those of others to advance their common goal of having a voice at the table. Their slogan was “Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs.”
The No Kings movement could learn from those Irish women.
I consider myself part of the No Kings movement. I call it a movement because movements are collective efforts by a group of people to bring about or resist social or political change.
There were eight marches to protest the values and policies of the Trump Administration in my small state of Rhode Island on June 14, which just so happened to be Flag Day.
That day, tens of thousands of people showed up for marches in New York, New Jersey and Southern California. Estimates overall suggest millions of people participated in marches across the United States. Photos of the demonstrations show some marchers waved U.S. flags, but the flags of other nations appeared as well.
Consequently, the simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.
As a female academic teaching security studies in professional military education for 20-plus years, the importance of “reading the room” and consequently properly “selling your message” to the audience cannot be overstated. What will make them listen? What will shut them down? The same is true for the growing numbers of Trump supporters who are disappointed — and frightened by — the actions of an increasingly authoritarian regime. Latino voters who helped Trump retake the White House, for example, are falling away, as are low-information voters, rural voters, young adults and ethnic voters. But they will not be lured to a movement that often conveys mixed messages through its rhetoric and images. The message ought to be of a tolerant, diverse, united America. But that’s not always the case.










The simple message conveyed by the name of the No Kings movement can get lost in the many messages that accompany and are associated with the movement. Frankly, it needs better organizational goals and marketing.


The Fourth of July is the perfect opportunity to do better.
Rather than showing up at rallies and parades with flags from other countries and symbols of political causes, No Kings supporters should show up with American flags. Diversity makes America great, and a sea of diverse individuals all waving the same flag shows a united front. All Americans are Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, and all Americans are Mexican on Cinco de Mayo. Now all Americans and those who want to live in an American democracy need to show their support for American democracy when trying to stop an autocracy. “Make America Great Again” Trumpians have usurped the America flag as their own but abandoned American values. The No Kings movement needs to embrace and retake the American flag as its own, as a symbol of American democracy and values.
Further, rather than glorifying individuals who have been unjustly attacked after they exercised their constitutional rights to, for example, free speech — some of whom are themselves divisive for their political views — simply support the right to free speech, as well as freedoms like religion and assembly. Don’t give Trumpians the opportunity to distort the important message of the No Kings movement into one of a hyper-radicalized left where individuals can’t even get along with each other. For the movement to grow, it must attract diverse individuals who can tip the scales away from authoritarianism. It must give all individuals a safe and welcoming place to go.
And while many individuals are rightly afraid of their rights being abused by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or some other form of retribution, individuals can be identified with or without a mask if the government is determined to do so. Pictures of individuals who show up at rallies or parades wearing masks and waving flags from other countries quickly become headline news or click bait for right-wing media. That does not serve the movement well.
We are living in an era of normalized chaos, deliberately created to allow autocracy to take hold. The No Kings movement clearly shows there is opposition. Movements can learn from the success and failure of others. No Kings should take an organizational and marketing lesson from the women of Northern Ireland.

North Carolina First Lady Anna Stein joined social justice advocate Kerwin Pittman on Wednesday to unveil the state’s second mobile Recidivism Reduction Center, expanding an effort to support people leaving prison as they transition back into society. 
The center is run by Recidivism Reduction Educational Program Services (RREPS), the nonprofit Pittman founded after his own experience with incarceration. In just 70 days, the group’s first mobile center has served more than 3,000 people in three cities — a pace Pittman said reflects both the urgency of the need and the effectiveness of the model. 
“Too many people have fallen through the cracks and aren’t given a second chance,” Pittman told attendees. “We’re here to change that.” 
The mobile centers — housed in customized RVs — provide case management and a suite of wraparound services, including job placement, housing assistance, mental health support, and help obtaining important documents like identification. The goal is to reduce recidivism by meeting people’s basic needs in the critical days and weeks after they leave prison. 
About 95% of people in North Carolina prisons will eventually be released, and studies show the first 72 hours after release are particularly high-risk, with many struggling to find stable housing, employment, or healthcare. 
First Lady Stein, a member of the state’s Joint Reentry Council, praised the initiative for addressing those challenges head-on. 
“Communities benefit when all residents can achieve their goals,” she said. “This work helps build safer, stronger communities by giving people the support they need to succeed.” 
North Carolina is among a half-dozen states participating in Reentry 2030, a national initiative aimed at improving reentry outcomes by the end of the decade. 
The state’s Joint Reentry Council — made up of government agencies, nonprofit groups, and directly impacted individuals — has identified reducing barriers to housing, employment, and health care as key priorities. 
RREPS opened its first mobile center in January. The vehicles are equipped with computers, private meeting space, and intake systems to connect clients with services. The organization’s goal is to deploy mobile units across the state to serve people in both urban and rural areas who might otherwise lack access to reentry support. 
Pittman said the centers are also designed to break down silos between service providers and ensure formerly incarcerated people aren’t left navigating a complex system alone. 
“Our mission is simple,” he said. “Nobody should be defined by their worst mistake.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1819-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-03 05:02:22.039483
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT Rail, Metro-North fares set to rise by 10%",Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/ct-rail-metro-north-transit-fares-rising/,The DOT said the hike is needed to fill a gap between how much money the agency requested for rail services and what the CT budget included.,"Connecticut is planning to raise fares on Metro-North Railroad and CT Rail transit throughout the state later this year in order to cover the increased cost of operating rail services.
Fares are slated to rise by 5% beginning Sept. 1, and another 5% on July 1, 2026. That means a rush-hour one-way trip between New Haven and Stamford on Metro-North, for example, would rise from $8.75 to $9.50 by July of next year. An off-peak one-way trip between Hartford and New Haven on CT Rail would rise from $8.25 to $8.75, and a one-way trip from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North during peak hours would rise from $16 to $17.75 by this time next year. 
Officials with the state Department of Transportation said the fare increase was necessary to keep the trains running.
“The cost to operate the existing level of service has increased year over year,” said Dan Baker, a transportation supervising planner with the department during a public meeting in Stamford on fare increases. “So in order to maintain the current level of trains and rail service and account for rising costs, fares needed to increase to offset a funding gap.”

DOT had requested $327 million from the state to cover the cost of rail services in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, but the legislature’s budget only included $316 million. The increase in fares will make up for that gap, officials said.
Connecticut last increased fares in 2023 when the Hartford line, New Haven line and Shore Line East faced a 4.5% increase. Before that, fares had stayed the same since 2018.
Baker said even with the planned increases this year and next, inflation will still have surpassed rail fare increases. Since 2018, inflation has driven up consumer prices by approximately 28%, whereas by 2026 rail fares will have increased by 14% to 15%, according to DOT data.
Fares account for roughly half of Metro-North’s operating costs, but a far smaller slice — less than 10% — of the Hartford and Shore Line East rail lines’ operating costs. Most of the rest of the funding comes from the state.
Many lines faced service and funding cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridership has rebounded unevenly across lines since then. 
Over that same period, the state has invested in new transportation and development projects, like the WALK rail bridge spanning the Norwalk River, and the Connecticut River bridge connecting Old Saybrook and Old Lyme.

Commuters’ concern
Some commuters expressed opposition to the state’s plan to raise fares, noting problems with the current service, including its delayed restoration after the Covid cutbacks, and general frustration about the rising cost of living throughout the state.
Susan Feaster, a frequent commuter on Shore Line East rail, said riders shouldn’t be on the hook for the state not fully funding rail transit. “Fare increases are never good, and doing a complete 10% by next year is a lot,” said Feaster, who also founded the Shore Line East Riders Advocacy Group in 2018.
Feaster said lawmakers boosted funding for child care and education in the coming biennium budget, which will enable many parents to work. “But you know, they should probably put some of that money into mass transit to help the people trying to get to work to pay those taxes, right?” she said.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council, said, “While I recognize the necessity of increasing rail rates and the fact it’s been a while since the last increase, I have serious reservations about raising bus and transit fares.” (Currently, bus fares aren’t slated to increase, though the Governor proposed bus fare hikes earlier this year.)
“These services are vital for many individuals facing economic challenges, and now may not be the right time to impose additional financial burdens on them,” he said.
DOT officials said they performed a service and fare equity analysis to assess the effects fare increases would have on low-income and minority customers. “We found that the proposed fare increases for 2025 and 2026 for Hartford line, Shoreline east and New Haven line do not have a disparate impact on minority customers, nor a disproportionate burden on low income customers, whether analyzed individually or in aggregate,” Baker said.

DOT held several public meetings to hear concerns from riders about the fare increases, but turnout was low. In Stamford last Monday, two residents attended. In New Haven last Tuesday, only one resident was there. And in Hartford last Thursday, only a small handful of residents were present.
Jon Bonci, a CT Rail passenger who attended the Hartford event, said he wasn’t confident his presence would change the state’s plans. “We’re gonna have to pay it, so what can you do? It doesn’t matter what we say in the public hearing,” he said.
Stamford resident Nicole Howerton expressed concern at the DOT’s public meeting at the Ferguson Public Library there. 
“As a resident of Stamford and a sole [commuter] for my family, it plays a major role in being able to get around and enjoy the community,” Howerton said. “When we’re presenting an increase of some nature, we need to look at the schedule and see if and how that’s meeting the community.”
A frequent commuter through the Metro-North’s West Haven station, she added that when rail service is down she has to take Ubers, which is another additional cost. 
Chris Irby, the only registered speaker at the New Haven public meeting, pointed to Bridgeport as an urban area that would be significantly affected by the fare hikes. As a Bridgeport resident and a frequent commuter, he said that Bridgeport residents already struggle to find money for the fares.
“Bridgeport is not a business city like New Haven is,” Irby said. “Everybody has to take the train to go to other towns, to go to work.” 
Irby also called on DOT to do a better job of advertising the events, stating that he would like to see more of DOT’s presence and advertising in downtown New Haven.
The department held additional public hearings virtually on June 30 and July 1. Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto will consider public comments through July 6, via email to dot.proposedtransitchanges@ct.gov or by leaving a voicemail at (860) 594-3612. DOT will take all comments into consideration before finalizing the proposed fare changes, officials said.

A study released this week by researchers at NC State University highlights the destructive impact that a bill sent to Gov. Stein by the General Assembly last week will have on electric ratepayers.
The bill, which bears the inaccurate and misleading title “Power Bill Reduction Act,” would repeal a bipartisan 2021 law that committed our state to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by the year 2030, as we move to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.
If the proposal were only about the environmental damage it will likely cause it would be bad enough, but as the NC State professors found, the bill will also significantly increase electricity bills for average households.
This is because it will incentivize Duke Energy to build more natural gas-fired electric generation plants—the price of natural gas is notoriously volatile—and shift the allocation of fuel costs from industrial to residential customers.
The bottom line: A bill this bad for consumers and the environment is richly deserving of a gubernatorial veto.

The people behind state programs that are supposed to create jobs aren’t taking credit for Ohio’s relatively high jobless rate. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on June 24 released May unemployment rates. Ohio tied with Rhode Island for the fifth-highest rate at 4.9%. Exceeding them were Kentucky, at 5%, California, at 5.3%, Michigan, at 5.4% and Nevada, at 5.5%.
Ohio had the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment rate in April. 
Ohio near the top in April unemployment 

Those jobless rates come despite a long history of state lawmakers and political leaders foregoing huge amounts of tax revenue on the argument that giving wealthy people and businesses tax breaks and other perks will prompt them to make new investments and create jobs.
For example, under the guidance of then-Gov. John Kasich, Ohio in 2013 created the LLC tax break, allowing people to incorporate as “pass through” entities and avoid a big portion of state income tax.
The tax break costs the state about $1 billion a year, and there’s little evidence that it’s done much in the way of create jobs. 
Ohio’s non-farm employment in December 2023 was 112.3% of its 2010 level, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. That lags the national average of 121.2% by nearly nine percentage points.
Meanwhile, the group of Ohioans already doing the best have done well under the LLC tax break. Policy Matters of Ohio in 2022 reported that the top 7% claiming qualifying business income in 2020 received 39% of the overall value of the tax break — about $390 million.
Despite the fact that the LLC loophole hasn’t lived up to its promises, the Ohio legislature hasn’t repealed it.
Around the same time that program was created, the Kasich administration also led the way in creating JobsOhio. Even though it was created by the legislature and was given a deal to lease the state’s liquor franchise, the Ohio Supreme Court has allowed it to operate as a “private” corporation, exempting it from Ohio’s open-records laws. 
The agency has spent more than $1 billion in what used to be state money, providing much of it to wealthy corporations in the form of incentives to locate or expand in Ohio, or at least not to leave. 
Research has shown that such incentives rarely play a deciding role in businesses’ strategic decisions. And JobsOhio has struggled to produce data that show it has improved the state’s employment picture.
How does JobsOhio stack up? Don’t ask them

Asked if Ohio’s relatively high unemployment rate reflected poorly on the work of his agency, spokesman Matt Englehart said it would be even worse — if not for JobsOhio.
“Much of the current unemployment is the result of federal layoffs and their ripple effects,” he said in an email. “Because of Ohio’s large number of federal workers, those federal layoffs could have created a severe shock to Ohio’s economy. Still, unemployment is only slightly elevated because of JobsOhio’s focus on industrial diversity. We focus on growing 10 sectors of Ohio’s economy, accounting for 22% of jobs, 29% of payroll, and 36% of Ohio’s gross state product.”
Ohio’s per-capita federal workforce isn’t all that big, according to a March report by Columbus-based Scioto Analysis. With 10 federal employees per 1,000 workers, Ohio tied with seven other states for the 26th-highest rate of federal employees.
Englehart didn’t furnish any data showing that JobsOhio has diminished the state’s unemployment rate.
“While JobsOhio does not directly impact month-to-month swings in preliminary data, we are investing aggressively for the long term to build a highly diverse, resilient economy across strategic industries,” he said.
Despite questions about its efficacy, Gov. Mike DeWine and legislative leaders in February extended JobsOhio’s control of the liquor franchise for an additional 15 years — until 2053. And while JobsOhio agreed to pay the state $1.41 billion for its initial lease, it wasn’t required to pay anything for its lucrative extension.
DeWine this week signed another windfall to the wealthiest Ohioans that was pitched as a way to help the economy. The now flat, 2.75% state income tax was touted as an “economic driver” by Ohio Senate Republicans.
But Policy Matters Ohio said it will cost $1.1 billion a year and the wealthiest 20% of households — those making more than $138,000 a year — will reap 96% of the benefit.

And Ohio is giving up tax revenue as President Donald Trump appears poised to slash Medicaid and food assistance to the poor. Ohio would have to fill those gaps or see hundreds of thousands lose health care and go hungry, advocates say. In addition, the cuts could plunge the economy into recession, depressing state tax collections as it voluntarily foregoes part of them.
DeWine’s office was asked, in light of Ohio’s relatively high unemployment, if it was wise to keep creating windfalls for the richest people in the state. It didn’t respond.

Background
In 2020 and 2021, the federal government offered supplemental benefits worth a couple hundred dollars a week. Nervous those extra dollars were keeping workers on the sidelines, DeWine chose to forgo the added benefits. Thirteen other Republican governors did the same.
DeWine’s announcement came in May of 2021, and a group of Ohio residents including Candy Bowling challenged the move in court.
The trial court turned them down, but the appeals court took a different tack. The judges determined state law requiring the governor “secure” for residents “all available advantages” applies to the supplemental benefits.
The dispute wound its way to the state supreme court later that year. The justices rejected bids to fast-track a decision, and eventually dismissed the cause as moot in a single sentence decision in November 2022.
In a follow up filing, attorneys for the governor asked the justices to be more specific. They argued the court’s order should explicitly vacate the appeals court decision putting supplemental benefits under the umbrella of “all available advantages.”
Ohio workers want court to order Gov. DeWine to protect unused unemployment funds

The Ohio Supreme Court declined.
“In light of this ambiguity,” the trial court decided, it would interpret the Supreme Court’s decision narrowly. Instead of applying to any challenge of the governor’s action, the court determined it only related to requests for “a court order enjoining the State of Ohio from prematurely terminating participation” in the program.
The case demanding the governor seek out the benefits he turned down was allowed to continue. In those proceedings, the parties brought forward an email from a Department of Labor official explaining states that initially turned down benefits are welcome to change their mind and laying out the procedures they would have to follow.
As recently as July 2024, the same official stated those policies remain in effect.
With that in mind, the trial court decided DeWine should try to claim benefits on behalf of Ohioans. The governor appealed, arguing the Ohio Supreme Court already settled this case and it’s unlikely those unemployment dollars are still out their waiting.
“We disagree on both points,” the Tenth Circuit judges wrote Monday.
The decision and reactions
Writing for a unanimous appeals court panel, Judge Shawn Dingus noted the Supreme Court never got at the merits of the case.
“A dismissal based on mootness is not a judgment on the merits,” Dingus wrote.
“Accordingly,” he continued, “the Supreme Court’s dismissal of (the case) as moot resolved only one issue: whether Bowling’s motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction presented a justiciable controversy at the time of its decision.”
Because the appeals court determined way back in 2021 that state law does compel the governor to pursue the supplemental benefits, and because the Supreme Court didn’t make a peep about it, that decision still holds.
As for DeWine’s argument that the case is moot because those unemployment funds are likely gone, Dingus said that’s not good enough.
“None of those reasons establish that recovery is impossible,” Dingus wrote. “Under the proper standard of possibility rather than substantial likelihood of recovery, Bowling’s action is not moot.”
In an email, a DeWine spokesman said simply, “We have no comment at this time as the appeals process continues.”

Attorney Marc Dann, the Democratic former Attorney General representing Ohioans seeking benefits, hailed the ruling a “landmark” decision.
“We are gratified that the Court has affirmed the rights of Ohio workers and families who were unjustly denied critical pandemic relief,” Dann said in a press release. “This decision is a victory for the rule of law and for the thousands of Ohioans who continue to struggle with the economic fallout of COVID-19.”
He went on to note any chance to recoup that lost funding is “especially important” in light legislation at the state and federal level reducing food assistance and other safety net programs.
“Injecting up to $3,000 into 300,000 working class households will temporarily take the sting out of those cuts,” Dann argued.

Jerry Moran’s post-passage statement relies on narrow, legalistic arguments to pitch a package that will harm the state he purports to represent. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Here is what we know: The gargantuan budget reconciliation package making its way through Congress will kick thousands of Kansans off Medicaid and cost the state’s hospitals billions of dollars.
Here’s something else we know: U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, doesn’t deny those facts.
But he still voted for the bill.
Moran issued a statement after the Senate voted for President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” early Tuesday. What’s remarkable about the senator’s words are not what they say, but what they don’t say.
I encourage everyone to take a look at the text. Here’s an enlightening paragraph.
“As this legislation was being drafted, I worked to make certain hospitals in Kansas were at the forefront of these discussions. After numerous discussions with Kansas hospital leaders, my colleagues and Administrator Oz, I was able to make changes to the legislation to make certain Kansas hospitals will not face any immediate cuts upon enactment of this legislation.”
Notice, again, what Moran omits. He doesn’t deny that Kansas hospitals will face cuts. He can’t, because he knows they will. Instead, he says they won’t face any immediate cuts.
That’s like saying I don’t face an immediate risk of death from the train hurtling toward my stalled car on the tracks. I might feel fine in the moment, but I’ll be squashed in no time.
Moran goes on:
“These provisions will protect Kansas’ ability to continue pursuing its application for increased Medicaid payments for certain providers. This change ensures that as state directed payments wind down, Kansas providers will be starting at a higher percentage of enhanced payments buying them much-needed time to utilize federal dollars as payments are reduced.”
Notice how many conditionals have been piled into this paragraph. Kansas can “continue pursuing” an application for increased payments. That doesn’t mean the state is going to actually receive such payments. And who will those increased payments go to? Well, certain providers.  That doesn’t mean everyone.
And what’s with the “much-needed time”? It’s much needed because, as Moran says later in the sentence, payments will be reduced. All of this should raise the eyebrows of critical readers. Why shouldn’t Moran support the enhanced payments and oppose the other cuts? I think that “R” after his name might provide a clue.
“I also secured a one-year delay in the implementation of reductions to state directed payments to give Kansas providers more time to access these resources. Finally, I pushed for the establishment of a rural provider fund to aid rural hospitals facing significant financial challenges. These changes and investments, along with tax cuts for Kansas families, will bolster our economy and strengthen the safety of our nation.”
Yes, the legislation passed by the U.S. Senate includes a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals. However, it’s worth digging into the details. That money will be paid out over five years and available to all 50 states. Given that Kansas hospitals will experience a $2.65 billion drop over 10 years, basic math suggests that that federal money won’t go far enough.
Finally, it’s important to note two items that Moran’s statement leaves out entirely.
He does not call the piece of legislation the “one big, beautiful bill.” He instead refers to it as “Senate budget reconciliation legislation.” The senator apparently wants to distance himself from Trump and any bombast surrounding this package. However, he still voted for it.
Most disappointingly, Moran makes no mention whatsoever of the 13,000 Kansans who will lose insurance coverage through this package. Indeed, he does not mention Medicaid recipients a single time in his statement.
Farmers, yes. The border, yes. Air traffic controllers, sure.
But poor people who need health insurance? Nah.
Moran has built a lot of goodwill across Kansas. His prairie pragmatism still contrasts positively to the MAGA theatrics of U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall. But that post-passage statement relies on narrow, legalistic arguments to pitch a package that will harm the state he purports to represent.
Real people’s lives and communities are on the line here. Trump’s administration has asked lawmakers to play reverse Robin Hood, snatching benefits from the poor to benefit the rich.
All the carefully tailored language in the world won’t change that.

The 1925 Scopes trial, in which a Dayton, Tennessee, teacher was charged with violating state law by teaching biological evolution, was one of the earliest and most iconic conflicts in America’s ongoing culture war.
Charles Darwin’s “Origin of Species,” published in 1859, and subsequent scientific research made the case that humans and other animals evolved from earlier species over millions of years. Many late-19th-century American Protestants had little problem accommodating Darwin’s ideas – which became mainstream biology – with their religious commitments.
But that was not the case with all Christians, especially conservative evangelicals, who held that the Bible is inerrant – without error – and factually accurate in all that it has to say, including when it speaks on history and science.
The Scopes trial occurred July 10-21, 1925. Between 150 and 200 reporters swooped into the small town. Broadcast on Chicago’s WGN, it was the first trial to be aired live over radio in the United States.
One hundred years after the trial, and as we have documented in our scholarly work, the culture war over evolution and creationism remains strong – and yet, when it comes to creationism, much has also changed.
 The trial

In May 1919, over 6,000 conservative Protestants gathered in Philadelphia to create, under the leadership of Baptist firebrand William Bell Riley, the World’s Christian Fundamentals Association, or WCFA.
Holding to biblical inerrancy, these “fundamentalists” believed in the creation account detailed in chapter 1 of Genesis, in which God brought all life into being in six days. But most of these fundamentalists also accepted mainstream geology, which held that the Earth was millions of years old. Squaring a literal understanding of Genesis with an old Earth, they embraced either the “day-age theory” – that each Genesis day was actually a long period of time – or the “gap theory,” in which there was a huge gap of time before the six 24-hour days of creation.
This nascent fundamentalist movement initiated a campaign to pressure state legislatures to prohibit public schools from teaching evolution. One of these states was Tennessee, which in 1925 passed the Butler Act. This law made it illegal for public schoolteachers “to teach any theory that denies the story of divine creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.”
The American Civil Liberties Union persuaded John Thomas Scopes, a young science teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, to challenge the law in court. The WCFA sprang into action, successfully persuading William Jennings Bryan – populist politician and outspoken fundamentalist – to assist the prosecution. In response, the ACLU hired famous attorney Clarence Darrow to serve on the defense team.

When the trial started, Dayton civic leaders were thrilled with the opportunity to boost their town. Outside the courtroom there was a carnivalesque atmosphere, with musicians, preachers, concession stands and even monkeys.
Inside the courtroom, the trial became a verbal duel between Bryan and Darrow regarding science and religion. But as the judge narrowed the proceedings to whether or not Scopes violated the law – a point that the defense readily admitted – it seemed clear that Scopes would be found guilty. Many of the reporters thus went home.
But the trial’s most memorable episode was yet to come. On July 20, Darrow successfully provoked Bryan to take the witness stand as a Bible expert. Due to the huge crowd and suffocating heat, the judge moved the trial outdoors.
The 3,000 or so spectators witnessed Darrow’s interrogation of Bryan, which was primarily intended to make Bryan and fundamentalism appear foolish and ignorant. Most significant, Darrow’s questions revealed that, despite Bryan’s’ assertion that he read the Bible literally, Bryan actually understood the six days of Genesis not as 24-hour days, but as six long and indeterminate periods of time.

The very next day, the jury found Scopes guilty and fined him US$100. Riley and the fundamentalists cheered the verdict as a triumph for the Bible and morality.
 The fundamentalists and ‘The Genesis Flood’

But very soon that sense of triumph faded, partly because of news stories that portrayed fundamentalists as ignorant rural bigots. In one such example, a prominent journalist, H. L. Mencken, wrote in a Baltimore Sun column that the Scopes trial “serves notice on the country that Neanderthal man is organizing in these forlorn backwaters of the land.”
The media ridicule encouraged many scholars and journalists to conclude that creationism and fundamentalism would soon disappear from American culture. But that prediction did not come to pass.
Instead, fundamentalists, including WCFA leader Riley, seemed all the more determined to redouble their efforts at the grassroots level.
But as Darrow’s interrogation of Bryan made obvious, it was not easy to square a literal reading of the Bible – including the six-day creation outlined in Genesis – with a scientific belief in an old Earth. What fundamentalists needed was a science that supported the idea of a young Earth.
In their 1961 book, “The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications, fundamentalists John Whitcomb, a theologian, and Henry Morris, a hydraulic engineer, provided just such a scientific explanation. Making use, without attribution, of the writings of Seventh-day Adventist geologist George McCready Price, Whitcomb and Morris made the case that Noah’s global flood lasted one year and created the geological strata and mountain ranges that made the Earth seem ancient.
“The Genesis Flood” and its version of flood geology remains ubiquitous among fundamentalists and other conservative Protestants.
 Young Earth creationism

Today, opinion polls reveal that roughly one-quarter of all Americans are adherents of this newer strand of creationism, which rejects both mainstream geology as well as mainstream biology.

This popular embrace of young Earth creationism also explains the success of Answers in Genesis – AiG – which is the world’s largest creationist organization, with a website that attracts millions of visitors every year.
AiG’s tourist sites – the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, and the Ark Encounter in Williamstown, Kentucky – have attracted millions of visitors since their opening in 2007 and 2016. Additional AiG sites are planned for Branson, Missouri, and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
Presented as a replica of Noah’s Ark, the Ark Encounter is a gigantic structure – 510 feet long, 85 feet wide, 51 feet high. It includes representations of animal cages as well as plush living quarters for the eight human beings who, according to Genesis chapters 6-8, survived the global flood. Hundreds of placards in the Ark make the case for a young Earth and a global flood that created the geological strata and formations we see today.
Ark Encounter has been the beneficiary of millions of dollars from state and local governments.
Besides AiG tourist sites, there is also an ever-expanding network of fundamentalist schools and homeschools that present young Earth creationism as true science. These schools use textbooks from publishers such as Abeka Books, Accelerated Christian Education and Bob Jones University Press.
The Scopes trial involved what could and could not be taught in public schools regarding creation and evolution. Today, this discussion also involves private schools, given that there are now at least 15 states that have universal private school choice programs, in which families can use taxpayer-funded education money to pay for private schooling and homeschooling.
In 1921, William Bell Riley admonished his opponents that they should “cease from shoveling in dirt on living men,” for the fundamentalists “refuse to be buried.” A century later, the funeral for fundamentalism and creationism seems a long way off.

Cutting federal aid could also shutter some rural hospitals already in financial trouble.




Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

He's seen here in 2018. Donald Page/Getty ImagesIf I wanted a failed football coach as my U.S. senator, I’d move to Alabama.
And I’m not moving to Alabama.
Seriously, what in Derek Dooley’s resume makes him think his next job ought to be serving Georgia in the U.S. Senate? At age 57, his sole asset as a political candidate is his legendary last name, gifted to him by his late father, the longtime football coach and athletic director at the University of Georgia. 
In football, that name opened a lot of doors for the younger Dooley, but once inside those doors he wasn’t able to stay long. His career peaked with a surprise hiring as head coach of the University of Tennessee, where he was fired in 2012 after building the worst record of any Volunteer coach since 1906.
Yet to hear Dooley tell it, mediocrity in other fields might be the perfect qualification for government work. He apparently aspires to be a generic candidate, spouting generic rhetoric, and in that sense at least he is already off to a grand start.
Consider his announcement of interest in the race:
“Georgia deserves stronger common-sense leadership in the U.S. Senate that represents all Georgians and focuses on results — not headlines. I believe our state needs a political outsider in Washington — not another career politician — to cut through the noise and partisanship and get back to real problem solving.”
Excited yet?
In that statement, Dooley refers to himself “a political outsider,” which is one way to put it. Another is to describe his potential candidacy as a political version of stunt casting, where producers put an unqualified celebrity in a role in hopes that name recognition will make up for a lack of actual skill or talent. It shows disrespect for the audience and disrespect for the craft, but sometimes it works, if only for a short period of time.
It worked for Republicans in Alabama, where Coach Tommy Tuberville leveraged a mediocre football career into a seat in the U.S. Senate, and now reigns as the dumbest member of that once illustrious chamber. It didn’t work so well in Pennsylvania, when TV’s Dr. Oz was the candidate. It also didn’t work here in Georgia in 2022, when the GOP ran a far more famous football celebrity, Herschel Walker, as their candidate for U.S. Senate.
As we know, Walker then proceeded to embarrass himself, his party and his state, losing what could have been a winnable race against Raphael Warnock. So, given that recent history, why would Georgia Republicans risk burning their hand again on the same hot stove, this time by considering Dooley? 
Well, there are reasons.
To Republicans, Herschel’s appeal as a candidate went beyond high name recognition. With a friendship with Donald Trump but no history in politics, he could be presented to the public, and more specifically to the GOP base, as a vacant slate, which he pretty much was.
At the time, GOP leaders feared that a highly competitive primary would unleash forces within the base that general-election voters would find disturbing, particularly with candidates competing to outdo each other for Trump’s approval. Walker was their way of side-stepping all that.
In 2025, three years later, that danger hasn’t gone away, and with Trump back in the White House it has intensified. Look at U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter of Savannah. While Dooley dithers about whether to run, Carter has jumped into the Senate race and is campaigning hard for the attention of the one man who matters most.
For example, when Trump says he wants to seize Greenland as American territory, Carter proposes to seize it and rename it “Red, White and Blue Land.” When Trump bombs Iran, Carter wants to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s shameless groveling of the sort that Trump loves, that GOP primary voters love, but many other Georgia voters will not.
But if your name isn’t Dooley, that’s what you have to do to get noticed.

The target? An invasive plant called hydrilla. The truth? This is a chemical shortcut. One that risks ecological collapse, damages native species, and puts public health in the crossfire.

Yes, hydrilla’s a real problem. No one’s denying that. But spraying entire ecosystems with high-collateral poisons is like napalming a neighborhood to kill weeds in one yard. It’s not management. It’s failure.
And if it feels like a sci-fi plot, it is.
This is exactly what happened to Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Some bureaucrat signed off on demolishing his house to make way for a bypass because “the plans were posted.” Now replace the house with a river. Replace the demolition company with the Army Corps. And replace the bypass with a toxic herbicide treatment that nobody knew was coming. Some pencil pusher woke up and decided our rivers needed purging. He doesn’t live here. He doesn’t swim here. He doesn’t drink from it. But his signature just altered your ecosystem. Colonel Justin R. Pabis signed the final authorization.
Gov. Ned Lamont? He shrugs. “Not our project.” Yet if a private company tried to dump these toxins, you’d have cops and hazmat trucks blocking them within the hour. But because this came with a PDF and a federal logo, it sails through? Where’s the National Guard? If the governor gave a damn, he’d halt this right now and demand public hearings. Because no one gave consent to chemical warfare against a river.
This isn’t how a free people treat public water. This is how a collapsed bureaucracy poisons it. Because no one consented to this. No town hall. No vote. No opt-out.
This isn’t how a free people treat their water. It’s how a collapsed system poisons it.
Diquat dibromide is a bipyridyl herbicide. It kills by oxidizing plant cells on contact.It doesn’t discriminate. It destroys all green tissue it touches. And it sticks in the sediment. It lingers. 
It’s banned in Europe. It’s linked to fish kills. It’s dangerous to humans. But it’s coming to: Chester Creek, Hamburg Cove, Selden Creek, Salmon River, Deep River and Lake Pocotopaug. All of them.


These are public waterways. You use them. Your kids use them. Wildlife depends on them. There is no long-term monitoring plan. There is no consent. Just a quiet federal rollout.
And here’s the kicker: This is a pilot program. If they normalize chemical warfare on Connecticut rivers, this template spreads. To Massachusetts. To Georgia. To New York.To everywhere. 
And you know the reason why? Because its easier to poison us than do the real work to remove the plant. And the real worst part? They are not even that difficult. They make boats designed for this exact purpose. And the worst of all worst parts? They don’t even know if the plant is even that harmful in the first place. Its in their own PDF,  section 4.6 It basically says the plant might be bad, but it might not.
This isn’t management. It’s pure laziness with brute force — a bulldozer. And we don’t need more patches. We need ecological intelligence.
Speak now, before your river is next.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-03 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Chronic homelessness –we are the problem,Katherine Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/03/chronic-homelessness-in-ct-we-are-the-problem/,"We judge the unhoused, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, even if they have been our neighbor all along.","The stigma of poverty is deeply painful for many unhoused citizens throughout Connecticut. It influences decision making, problem solving and the personal safety of more than a thousand individuals across the state. 
Many would rather remain in unsafe conditions to avoid the shame of being found out. In many of these cases, medical emergencies go unaddressed and physical violence becomes more prevalent. Those in the crisis of poverty are often in danger.
For those with mental health diagnoses and/or substance use history, these situations are often chronic. The alternative is emergency shelter. Connecticut offers emergency shelter for those in active addiction. What many may not consider is that those in recovery and those actively using drugs are mingling and developing friendships. In a stressful and unstructured environment like a wet shelter, this creates endless opportunity for failure.
The goal of many (if not all) agencies within the homeless system is to practice effective harm reduction. In my experience, this is often done poorly or not at all. The problem with harm reduction strategy is that it needs to be practiced consistently and without deviation from its designed procedure. Half-assed attempts or alterative practices create the opposite effect. This is a regular occurrence within wet shelters.
As a provider and volunteer in the community, I speak directly with those utilizing recovery resources in New London County and I am well versed in the goings-on of shelter. Temporary residents of shelter often complain about the lack of support, the ‘free-for-all’ use of drugs, theft, violence and complacency of guests setting a tone for their own journey. The phrase ‘doing nothing’ comes up again and again.
Services are not properly tailored to the individual either. The state and federal governments pour millions of dollars into helping the unhoused. Programs are created to support these individuals but when the staff isn’t properly trained or vetted, or if the clients are only given 20% of what they need, problems occur. This is a huge issue and it is commonplace. 
In my experience, shelter guests are often treated like herded cattle. They are hustled into housing when they have little to no support to maintain it. It’s also often done on a whim which is chaotic and awful for the guests. In some instances, people are offered poor or inappropriate housing because it is known this person cannot maintain housing independently. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. They cycle in and out of shelter over and over and over.
The system creates unrealistic standards as well. A person should be enrolled in and exited from shelter in a very brief amount of time. For example, 45 days or 60 days. This is partly because funding is linked to ‘length of stay.’
Picture this, you’ve been laid off from your job where you were barely making ends meet. As someone with poor computer skills, you struggle to apply for work as most employers use electronic applications. You reach out to your local employment office and schedule an appointment for help – it’s six weeks out. When you arrive at that appointment, you are told you need a resume, which you can’t make on your own (those computer skills again). They help you build one, but this takes more than one appointment. You have been applying for work on your own but don’t get many responses – likely because of your applications. This process becomes tedious and diminishes your self-esteem.
Folks living paycheck to paycheck likely have little or no savings to back them up in an emergency either, right? So now you are past due on rent and getting a notice to quit. Eventually you end up in shelter and are told you need to get a job when you’ve been trying to gain employment for months already. Are you frustrated yet? A little defeated?
Now, picture you are applying for work while staying in shelter and after three weeks, you get a job offer. It’s only part time, but it’s better than nothing, right? You are told you can’t be housed with that income. It’s another two weeks before you receive a check and it’s only for a few hours. Eventually, you ‘time out’ of shelter because the job you got isn’t enough and you aren’t eligible for a housing voucher so out to the street you go. Even if you aren’t struggling with mental health or addiction, being unhoused can feel like navigating a landmine field.
While working as a program manager in this system, I have witnessed many heartbreaking situations where those who want to succeed are sidetracked by the fishbowl dynamic that occurs within shelter. Dozens of these people, gainfully employed and contributing to society at the time, are sabotaged by the system that is tasked to help them – all while taking no responsibility. It is clear to staff, clients and many previously housed (or never housed) individuals that in many instances, those in charge are more concerned with legal liability and their own personal reputation than the outcomes they create. Some leaders aren’t even present at their own facilities. This shouldn’t be allowed. The disconnect between government agencies, agency leaders and issues is alarming and sad. All they have to do is listen.
I say WE ARE THE PROBLEM because the public has a limited understanding of homelessness or poverty in general. We judge, we criticize, we don’t want to pay for them, and we don’t want them in our back yard, regardless of if they have been our neighbor all along. 
The fact is, they are and have been. WE ARE THE PROBLEM because our government doesn’t support its most vulnerable people the way they need to be supported. Rental caps, funding for holistic mental health and longer-term support so no one is left behind would be a great start. 
WE ARE THE PROBLEM because we put people in positions of authority and leave them unchecked. Third party reviews should be required for all non-profit agencies, not just for CARF Certification or clout. Reviewers should be onsite for regular unannounced auditing of daily procedures as well as a review of leadership practices. This should include a standard of overall well-being and physical safety for clients and frontline staff.
All Connecticut residents can benefit from the success of the chronically unhoused. When supported, they contribute to the community in ways that others cannot, but it would also decrease public risks that aren’t always considered. Public health, property and violent crime, and environmental damage are just the tip of the iceberg. 
We have a golden opportunity to help our neighbors and finally experience all the value they can bring to the table.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose sweeping New Deal reforms transformed post-depression America, spoke these words in a rousing nomination speech that he delivered at the Democratic National Convention on June 27, 1936. FDR also set a new governance ideal for the Democratic Party: to use a “spirit of charity” in order to create, support, and sustain government institutions, recognizing that they are not businesses or commodities, but a public good.
Democrats in Connecticut hold all of the levers of power, including a veto-proof supermajority in the state house and senate. But despite the state’s $480.3 million General Fund surplus and overflowing reserves, Connecticut Democrats have subordinated the public good to an even “higher” ideal: the fiscal guardrails.
Years of contrived austerity have demonstrated to voters that no public good (indeed, nothing at all!) is more important than aggressively paying off Connecticut’s pension debts and filling up the state’s Budget Reserve Fund, which will top $6 billion this year.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat and the most influential champion of the guardrails, closed this year’s legislative session with the claim of “no new taxes.” Perhaps this is true on your W-2, and the withholding of state taxes from your salary (already among the highest in the nation) will not change. But our municipal taxes are at record highs, because the fiscal guardrails merely shift the burden of supporting underfunded services away from the state onto local governments.
Despite Connecticut having one of the highest effective state tax rates in the country, the system of guardrails and caps has meant dramatically less support of our state institutions. This only hurts the people who need their services most, who already are under strain from regressive state taxes.
Steep cuts to our public colleges and universities make as much sense as putting regular gas in a Corvette. It may save a few bucks in the short term, but it will result in degraded performance and damage that are far more costly in the long term. Students and their families pay the repair bill with increased tuition on top of their sky-high taxes. State support for UConn, for example, is 30% lower today than it was in 2008; it should come as no surprise that tuition is now 20% higher, and rising.
We should start calling the fiscal guardrails what they are: a regressive tax. “Fiscal guardrails” is too kind a euphemism for a generational wealth transfer that makes today’s taxpayers pay for the sins of previous administrations.
Governor Lamont has made stringent enforcement of the guardrails his signature policy. But he has failed to justify to Connecticut taxpayers how the benefits of making aggressive debt repayments outweigh the costs of harm to our state institutions in the here-and-now.
Keeping our state institutions in a state of perpetual financial crisis means that more time gets spent on budget triage than helping people who need their services. This is hardly a fiscally responsible use of the few tax dollars that the state is actually able to appropriate for the budget.
What was enacted by legislation can be changed by legislation, and the supermajority possessed by Connecticut Democrats removes any impediments to putting constitutional amendments on the table. Our lawmakers cannot continue to pretend as though there is no legal process to make even small adjustments to the caps or to draw funds from the Budget Reserve Fund.
Investing our hard earned tax dollars into debt repayments and amassing huge cash reserves while willfully cutting critical social services is the very definition of what FDR warned us about: a “government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.”

Dan Sullivan gives an annual address to the Alaska State Legislature on Mar 20, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, took questions from Alaska reporters on Tuesday, in an hourlong phone news conference. He expressed praise and support for the Trump administration’s agenda with the federal budget megabill, saying, “No state fared better from the bill” than Alaska. 
The following transcript of the news conference has been lightly edited to improve readability:
Sen. Dan Sullivan: Thanks everybody back home. You should have gotten a very big, detailed press release that we just sent out. It’s a big bill, a lot there, and what I want to do is kind of cover the highlights, and then be glad to take your questions. But, look, I think this was a huge opportunity for our state. There’s no perfect bill, but a lot that’s in this bill are things that we’ve been working on, not just for months, but for years. And it was a great opportunity with like- minded members of the Senate to really, really advance Alaska’s interests across a whole host of areas. And I think it’s safe to say that no state fared better from this bill than our state, and I’m going to give you a couple of reasons why that’s the case. 
No. 1 and first and foremost, across a whole host of areas, to me, this is a jobs bill. This is a bill about growing our economy, and taking advantage of opportunities. You know, in 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). It was considered historic when we did that in that bill. This bill puts into law lease sales, not just for ANWR again, but for NPR-A (National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska). It goes back to the Trump era, integrated activity plan of 2020, for Cook Inlet and for opportunities for timber sales in the Chugach, in the Tongass. Very importantly, these mandated lease sales are in the law which protects us from, to be frank, administrations, like Joe Biden that we experienced for four years, when they came in with executive orders to try to shut us down. And something, again, we’ve been trying to get done for a long time: Every single one of these big federal areas, ANWR, Cook Inlet, NPR-A, is now at a 70-30 revenue share between the state and the feds. The state getting 70 (percent), and the feds getting 30 (percent). Now these start later in the 2034 period, but for those of you who know our history on resource development, we’ve been trying to get that kind of share more towards the state for decades. So we were able to achieve that across the board. So this is going to be very big for jobs, really important for additional revenues for our state Legislature and state government because of this. And then a whole bunch of other energy provisions, one of which is the new Energy Dominance Council, funded up to a billion dollars. And that’s something that, already, our AKLNG (Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline) project and the secretary of energy are focused on to help advance that project even more. So big wins on economic growth, resource development. If we get this into law, with President Trump’s executive orders on Alaska, this is going to be a really, really exciting time for our economy. 
So next, a real focus here on tax relief for hard-working families and small businesses. As many of you know, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included across-the-board tax cuts for small businesses, middle-class families, doubling of the child tax credit to support working families — all of that expires at the end of this year. So without this tax reform, this budget reconciliation bill, there would be about a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Alaska’s small businesses would be crushed, middle-class families would be crushed. So by extending the 2017 tax cuts, we avoid a massive tax increase. There’s a whole host of new provisions. These are bills that I co-sponsored to focus on making child care more affordable for families with young children. The list, I won’t go through it, it’s in the press release. It’s a really big part of this bill. Alaskans have been reaching out to our office saying child care, child tax credits, employer-provided child care provisions are really important. When I gave my speech at the Legislature last year, there was a lot of talk about that. We hit historic levels of that (funding) for middle-class families. 
I want to get to a couple other areas that I think are important. This is an area that is really important to Alaska, that really hasn’t made hardly any news. I’m the chairman of the commerce committee subcommittee in charge of the Coast Guard. This bill has the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, nearly $25 billion. Think about this, the Coast Guard’s annual budget is about $11.5 billion. So this is a massive investment, and it’s all in Coast Guard assets: 16 new icebreakers – we think icebreakers are really important; 22 new cutters, a $300 million port infrastructure in Juneau to homeport the ice breaker, the Storis. We’re going to have a ribbon cutting in Juneau in August. I’ve been working on these icebreakers, homeporting in our state for 10 years. Forty new helicopters – a lot of these Coast Guard assets are going to be coming to our state. There’s almost $5 billion in additional shore-side infrastructure that will be spread across the country. Again, a lot of that will be coming to communities like Sitka, Seward, Kodiak. These are really, really important elements of the Coast Guard. But as you guys know, when you’re builing out infrastructure, $300 million, for example, in Juneau for the new port facilities, that’s a lot of jobs. So it’s very exciting. 
Related to the Coast Guard are the provisions to secure the border and fight fentanyl. As you guys know, we’ve had the highest overdose rates in fentanyl for the last two years. There’s a real big commitment – $46 billion to build the southern wall, $8 billion for Border Patrol facilities. And a lot more for the kind of nuts and bolts of a more efficient immigration system, the immigration court system, federal courts, detention facilities. So the president has already shut down the border, almost 99% decrease in illegal aliens. But we have a huge challenge still with fentanyl, with drug cartels, and this is going to shut that down.
Building up our military – $150 billion for our military. Again, a lot of this goes to taking care of our troops. It builds on the historic pay raise — 14.5% — we had for enlisted personnel last year. That’s the highest pay raise ever. Twenty-five billion dollars for the president’s Golden Dome. That’s missile defense. Some of you may have seen, I introduced my Golden Dome Act about two weeks ago. A lot of that — a significant amount of that is going to be coming to Alaska, because we remain the cornerstone of missile defense. So that’s very exciting for our state. Again, national security, but jobs. One thing that’s in there, it’s kind of a small item, but we think really important. Again, a lot of us have been working on this for years:, $115 million to support the exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure, like reopening the Naval Air Station at Adak. So a really, really important component of our military. Nationally, of course, there’s a lot focused on ship building, a lot focused on the Indo-Pacific, but a lot of that is going to help our state. 
Another area that’s really important for the country, but also our state: upgrading Alaska and our nation’s aviation system – we have about $12.5 billion for nationwide air traffic control reforms and upgrades, and a significant amount, about $120 million, will be coming to our state building on the $25 million annually that the president and (U.S. Transportation) Secretary Duffy announced for the Alaska FAA Safety Initiative. So we’re building on that. 
Then finally, I wanted to mention the area where we’re going to be strengthening Alaska’s health care. You know, you may have seen, there’s a lot of ads back home, I think false ads, talking about me and this bill. Here’s the facts on the bill: It doesn’t touch Medicare, doesn’t touch Social Security, despite some of these false ads saying to the contrary. And the major reform in this bill is the Medicaid reform that centers around limitations and reductions in states’ use of what are called provider taxes and directed payments. States use that to enhance their federal Medicaid payments. That’s where the reforms in Medicaid are. We are the only state that doesn’t use provider taxes or state-directed payments, so the Medicaid programs and federal funds that the state receives are not impacted by the provided tax reforms in this bill, because we don’t do that. We’re the only state that doesn’t do that. 
So what we have been able to do, and what we’re working on, even as late as last night is to have a very significant, I got a plus up last night to $50 billion in the legislation for rural hospitals, and rural health care that will go to states. There’s a flat rate that — how much that will go — it’s about $100 million a year. And in discussions with senior administration officials, I am very confident that the state of Alaska, contrary to some of the ads on TV that we’re focused on cutting Medicaid, will be getting at least about $200 million a year for the next five years, in addition to what we’ve already gotten in Medicaid. That is a very significant plus-up that will go to the state, it will be able to be used for Medicaid-backlog challenges. And we think that that’s going to be a really, really important innovation, and that was something that I played a lead role in, in the last several weeks. 
There are common sense work reforms that are both in the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the Medicaid provisions. Some of you might be familiar with the Clinton-era welfare reforms, that was a bipartisan work requirement during the Clinton administration. That was 30 hours a week, this is about a third less. It’s 20 hours a week, for able-bodied individuals who have no dependents, who are not disabled, who do not have mental health challenges, or are not seniors. And there’s a way in which that’s going to work for Medicaid, for SNAP. But we were able to get provisions that take Alaska’s unique challenges with regard to the work requirements. For example, all Alaska Natives are exempt from both work requirements on SNAP and Medicaid. That was something that I worked for hard in this bill. And then there are other provisions that, if you’re showing good-faith efforts to make these work requirements, you get extended periods. So those are important as well. 
And then finally, as I mentioned, there’s a whole host of areas where we’re making sure we’re taking care of seniors, elders. There’s a provision it’s about $12,000 per couple for tax deductions to reduce Social Security taxes. This builds on my Social Security Fairness Act that passed at the end of last year, for more take-home money for seniors. And some of the other areas: 100% federal Medicaid match for all Alaska Natives. As I mentioned, complete work requirement exemptions for our Alaska Native communities, many of whom live in rural areas, and that’s very hard to undertake these work requirements. And a final thing that I just wanted to mention. You know, the implementation of this bill, as I mentioned — long night last night, but we’ve been working on some of these things for years. 
There’s been some articles, and I want to just clarify it, because it’s important for people to know the way this works in the budget reconciliation process is that you have to make sure the provisions of the bill are compliant with what’s called the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule is a parliamentary statutory procedure dealing with budgetary and tax issues. The provisions of the bill typically have to meet that Byrd rule, but that’s not self-executing. The way in which provisions are challenged is that a Democratic leader, a Republican leader, will go to the parliamentarian and say, ‘Hey, I want this provision stripped out of the bill because it violates the Byrd rule.’ So the leadership on either side of the political aisle here has to proactively go after provisions that they want to strip out of the bill. What I saw, and it was pretty remarkable, pretty shocking, to be perfectly honest. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, on literally every provision that I’ve talked about that benefited Alaska. And it is a long list, the ANWR leases, NPR-A, Cook Inlet, a fund for rural hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii, an FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) increase – that I’ve been working on for years to get a federal match requirement for Medicaid to be increased in Alaska and Hawaii – ice breakers, homeporting in Juneau, border security, heck, even charitable deductions for Alaska Native whaling communities, every single one of these things — flexible SNAP requirements — Chuck Schumer and the Democrats came after us to try to strip out of this bill. So it’s a little ironic to me, particularly when I’m seeing far-left groups align with Schumer running millions of dollars of ads back home, saying wrongly, ‘Dan Sullivan wants to, you know, cut Medicaid,’ when the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska was Chuck Schumer yesterday when he went after our FMAP provision for Alaska and Hawaii, and unfortunately, he was successful. So the bill had a really good federal match increase provisions for Alaska and Hawaii for Medicaid, and Schumer got it removed. That’s hundreds of millions of dollars for Alaskans getting Medicaid money that the minority leader, Democrat leader of the U.S. Senate took out of the bill yesterday. But we kept fighting back, and this bill, like I said, is still a very strong bill, we think, for our state. And appreciate all the interest, and would love to take your questions.
Brian Venua, KMXT: So one of the things I was curious about, (Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa) Murkowski said in her statement, in an email that the bill, while there’s good provisions, it’s not good enough for the rest of our nation and hopes that this isn’t a final draft. I was curious, what are your thoughts about that sentiment? And you know, what are some parts of it that you’re worried about or would change if you had, like, a magic wand?
Sen. Sullivan: Brian, you know, as you can imagine, I’ve been working with Sen. Murkowski on these provisions for years. And last night, you know, we were all working together and our staffs, that’s kind of a daily thing. I didn’t see her statement, but my understanding from what you said, I know for a fact that she thinks, like I do, that this is a strong bill for Alaska, and I think it is. And so, to be honest, that’s been my focus. Heck, even in Washington, D.C., there’s been some news commentary, even some politicians on both sides of the aisle saying, you know, this bill was a home run for Alaska. Some were critical that it was so good for Alaska. I take it as a badge of honor that this bill has a lot of really good things for Alaska, so that was my focus. I will say that, you know, for me, if I had a magic wand – I had been working on this FMAP provision, that’s the federal match for Alaska and Hawaii, because we both have statutory costs of living levels that are higher than any other place in the country. In the FMAP, it’s kind of complicated, but the formula for your FMAP is based solely on per-capita income, and ever since I became a senator, I’m like, that’s unfair. It should be based on the cost of living and the cost of health care. So I was able to get this FMAP provision to increase our federal match to 65%, and would increase Hawaii’s to 15%. I talked to the Hawaiian senators like, hey, let’s do this together. It’s bipartisan, you guys agree with this provision. And for whatever reason, Chuck Schumer tried to strike it. We fought it really hard. It took us two days. We were fighting in front of the parliamentarian saying, this complies with the Byrd rule. We ended up losing. And you know, that was a real loss, not just for Alaskans, but Hawaiians. But we readjusted and had a more robust provision in the rural health care fund that I talked about, that I still think is going to be a couple hundred million a year for Alaska on health care.
Delcenia Cosman, Homer News: How does the new Medicaid work requirement, outlined in this bill, how would that affect seasonal workers such as the Homer fishing fleet and tourism employees that are not necessarily employed year round?
Sen. Sullivan:  So the work requirement is 20 hours. As I mentioned, 30 hours was the standard under the Clinton administration, but it doesn’t include, as I mentioned, people with dependents, the elderly, and disabled. So there’s a broad exemption in terms of work requirements. And remember, the work requirement is, it’s not just work – you can volunteer for 20 hours. You can go to training for 20 hours. So there’s a whole host of ways in which you can meet that. And then we had provisions that completely exempted all Alaska Native communities in that but we did make adjustments exactly to your question, for seasonal workers, and we also made adjustments — and these are things that Sen. Murkowski and I got in — for areas of the state that have traditionally high unemployment. So to your question, we did make adjustments in that regard, and we can send you the details of that. I don’t have the provision right now in front of me.
Liz Ruskin, Alaska Public Media: Hi there, Senator, the bill extends tax cuts, it creates tax cuts. And as you noted, it spends a lot of money on Coast Guard and defense and other items. It was projected to add more than $3 trillion to the national debt. I’m not sure what the new score is, but are you comfortable with that addition to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, look, Liz, when we look at this, there’s this big kind of debate on the baseline, the use of the way in which CBO (Congressional Budget Office) does the score, and the way in which we’re looking at this, this actually has historic savings of about roughly $1.6 trillion, right? And you know, the big debate is that we believe, and you probably saw this debate in Washington, D.C., that the debt and deficit should be marked from the current baseline right and current policy baseline. What that means is — and even the Obama administration had done this during their budget reconciliation — that it assumes that these taxes were not going to continue. So that was the different challenge here and when we’re pretty sure that the tax cuts were going to continue, and so we think the $3 trillion if you look at it from a current policy baseline, is actually quite inaccurate. So as you know, there’s a big debate on this topic, but we think that that $3 trillion assumes that the tax cuts were going to expire, but under current policy, which is the way we viewed this, that’s $3 trillion that we didn’t think was the accurate score under the CBO score.
Ruskin: So do you think this bill lifts us out of debt, that we have no problem with national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: No, I think we have a huge problem in national debt. I mean, to be honest. You know, last year, we had $37 trillion in debt, and we paid out $950 billion in interest, which is more than we paid for the Pentagon. So what we need to be doing, from my perspective, is reforming programs, which you’re seeing with Medicaid, but also growing the economy, and that’s why keeping the tax cuts extended is going to be really important. So this, we believe, is going to reduce the deficit by about $508 billion. And I think the key, as you know, it’s not just $35 trillion, which is a huge number, it’s the percent of GDP that your debt is. And this is going to start, we believe, with the strong economic growth that will come with this, start to reduce the debt. If you remember, CBO doesn’t always get these scores right. When we did the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they underestimated the growth by about one and a half (percentage) points, and they underestimated the revenues that would come in by about $1.4 trillion. So the key is, you got to have savings, which this bill does, but you can’t grow your way out of a … $35 trillion debt, you got to — I’m sorry, you can’t cut your way out. You got to grow your way out. So the key here is strong economic growth.
Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News: So my question is about Medicaid in Alaska, we’ve heard from a lot of concern that the new eligibility requirements would cause thousands of eligible Alaskans to lose access to Medicaid. So my question for you, Senator, is do you think that the number of uninsured Alaskans is going to increase after the passage of this bill?
Sen. Sullivan: So do you mean uninsured in terms of people not receiving Medicaid, or just uninsured as it relates to another issue?
Samuels: The number of Alaskans who don’t have health insurance. So if you also want to address the potential expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, that would also be helpful.
Sen. Sullivan:  Yeah, look, I think the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is an important issue, and it wasn’t addressed in this bill. And as you know, that expires at the end of the year, and I think it’s something that I’m hopeful that there’s going to be a bipartisan consensus to address that, but it wasn’t. And to be honest, I think that some of the issues related to that, you know, in a bill like this, you can’t fit everything under the constraints of the Byrd rule. There’s a lot of things here, like I said, my FMAP provision that got taken out of this bill when Schumer challenged it. So that’s one that I don’t think would fit under here, but I think it’s an important issue that we have to look at. It’s kind of a cliff, I don’t think we should have a cliff in terms of those people who are relying on that for their health care. In terms of the backlog for Medicaid. I actually think this bill is going to help that. Again, we are not like other parts of the state, going to see any kind of dramatic reduction, any kind of reduction in our Medicaid federal dollars, because we don’t use provider taxes, and we don’t use state-directed payments, which is where all the reforms are for this bill. So the estimates of about $200 million a year from this rural health provider fund that’s in the bill. It’s a $50 billion fund. I was able to get that doubled in the last couple days, because I think it’s very important for rural communities. I think that that is actually an opportunity for our state to undertake reforms to get at the (application processing) backlog with a lot of that money. We’ve been talking to the governor and his team, and I think that they see that it’s an opportunity.
You know, there have been some stories that with the work requirement, some people might choose not to either work or volunteer, or go to school, or go to training for 20 hours a week. And if they choose not to do that, and they are eligible for the work requirement, you could see Medicaid for those individuals slipping. But we don’t think that that’s going to be a high number. And those are really the only areas in which I could see a Medicaid slippage in the state, because we’re not losing funding. To the contrary, with the estimated $200 million plus, I think it’s being more than $200 million a year from this fund. The state’s going to have a lot of opportunities to make reforms to the program. It’ll make it more efficient and serviceable for the people.
James Brooks, Alaska Beacon: Senator, I talked to Sen.Murkowski, and she said she agonized over her decision whether to vote for or against this. Was there ever a point where you questioned whether you would vote for it, and if so, what was it over?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, James, I did. Look, so I know I kind of sound like a broken record, but I’ve been really, really, really focused on this FMAP provision for Alaska. And again, I don’t want to sound too technical, but it’s the federal match requirement for Medicaid. We have one of the lowest matches in the country. We used to be 50%: 50% state and 50% federal. That’s the lowest in America. We’re about 51% right now, which is still really low. And it would always really bug me, because that formula is just pure per-capita income. That’s how they do it, which is why we have a low formula. It doesn’t take into account your cost of living, and it doesn’t take into account the high cost of health care delivery, which we have in those two categories, the highest in the country. So I’ve always said, ‘Hey, we need a much higher FMAP.’ And I’ve been working on this for years, because I just think it’s unfair to Alaska. There’s states that have 80-20 (percent) if you can believe that. Certain states have statutory FMAP – DC has a 70% statutory FMAP. The American territories, Marianas, Virgin Islands, have like an 80% FMAP, and we’re at 50 (percent). So I literally went all the way to very senior folks in the administration and all my Republican colleagues, saying, ‘I need this provision.’ And I explained why, and I got support from the White House, and I got support from all my Republican colleagues, and my provision was actually us and Hawaii, because they had similar challenges. And I will tell you when it got stripped out by Sen. Schumer, it was a giant, enormous frustration of mine, because I’ve been working on this and I care really deeply about this issue. I’ve been working on this issue almost since I got to the Senate. So I had a little bit of a dark night of the soul when that happened. And then we tried to fix it several times, different kind of tweaks and the parliamentarian and the Democrats kept challenging it and we kept losing. So I’m not sure it was a moment where I was going to say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ but it was a moment of enormous disappointment when you’re trying it and you’re very close. Because remember, this was in the bill, my FMAP provision was in the budget reconciliation bill that we voted to get on four days ago. And when you work hard on something that you know is right for the people you represent, and then it kind of goes down the drai: It was frustrating, very, very frustrating to me. And we’ll re-attack it. The way I did it was, it was my initiative to get permission from my colleagues to plus-up this rural fund. It’s a very big rural fund now, $50 billion and to get essentially the equivalent for Alaska of what my FMAP provision would have been. My FMAP provision would have been about an additional $180 million a year for Alaska for Medicaid. And this rural fund actually gets more for us, about $200 million probably it might even go up to almost $300 million, so that was the moment. That’s a long answer, but I’ve been working on this issue for a really, really long time. I feel very passionate about it. And I was close, and it slipped away from me, because Schumer actually was the one who took it out, right? And it’s very ironic. You watch all these ads, you guys are seeing them ‘Dan Sullivan supposedly cutting Medicaid.’ That’s the false attack by Schumer’s affiliated groups. And you know, he’s the only guy cutting Medicaid in Alaska. I mean, he did it the other night, and it was really disheartening for me.
Jack Barnwell, Fairbanks Daily News Miner: Senator, this bill calls for the eventual sunsetting of the clean energy tax credit. Do you have any concerns about how that will affect projects in rural Alaska that might rely on these projects, and don’t have any direct benefit from natural gas or the high diesel and fuel rates costs?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Jack, it’s a really good question. And I will tell you, it was a big component of the debate that was going on. We were able to get a much more generous kind of runway than what was in the House bill that came over. The House bill had this provision that was much more stringent on when the subsidies for those kinds of renewable projects would go away, and we were able to extend that. And then you may have seen there was also this provision in the House bill that they called an excise tax that was kind of a penalty. We got that actually removed in the Senate bill yesterday. And you know, one of the things that we were making the argument on, particularly for Alaska, is that our construction season and start for the timeline of these production and investment tax credits is so short up here. And that we needed an extended and better, phased-out timeline. We did get that to some degree, certainly an improvement from the House bill, but it’s still, I think, a concern to some. Now, as you know, some of these subsidies have been going on for many, many years, and it’s important for some of these industries to not have to rely on it. But I think the timeline extension was what we were trying to achieve and we got that some degree. And getting rid of this excise tax, which is essentially a penalty, we did achieve that in the bill. So good question. A lot of debate on this over the last several weeks, and that’s where we ended up.
Katie Stavick, Mat-Su Frontiersman: I just wanted to know, because of all the changes to the Senate version of the bill and now it goes back to the House. Are you worried at all about the bill not passing the House as it is now?
Sen. Sullivan: Yeah, Katie, it’s obviously the million dollar question. So as you probably have seen, on budget reconciliation, there’s a lot of back and forth, right? Before you go to the reconciliation part of the bill, you have to do what’s called a budget resolution. And we were doing that in the spring. We passed that in the Senate. We sent it back to the House. They sent it back to us. Those are the precursors to getting on the bill itself, the budget reconciliation bill. And the reason all this is important, it’s under the 1974 Budget Control Act, and Democrats and Republicans both use that act, the reason it’s important that you have to comply with the procedures and comply with the Byrd Rule — which is why it’s so important — is that in the Senate, you only have to get 51 senators to pass these kind of provisions. You know, I get along with my good Democratic friends in the Senate, but none of them would ever support the provisions that we got on ANWR, that we got on NPR-A, that we got on Cook Inlet, they just wouldn’t, right? So we needed this budget reconciliation bill to just be able to have Republican senators and House members vote and pass legislation that fits within the Byrd rule, so there’s a 51 Senate threshold. So that’s why all this is really important, that rules are quite arcane, but there’s already been a lot of back and forth between the House and Senate on the resolutions. Now this is the real, you know, the real live bill. You might remember the budget reconciliation bill started in the House. It came over to us (the Senate). 
It’s kind of interesting, the speaker of the House came over to one of our lunches a couple weeks ago and said, ‘Hey, Senators, we really want you to not change this at all.’ Well, we tried to not change it much, but we changed it some, and now it’s going to go back over there. I think, you know, one goal would be for them to just pass it as is, but that’s going to be up to the speaker and the members of the House. But I think he’s moving forward. I know (Alaska U.S. Rep.) Nick Begich is back in D.C. If they can’t get to passing our legislation, as is, they could pass another version, and then we would go into what’s called a conference. Where leaders in the Senate, leaders in the House would meet, would try to hash out our differences. That’s a possibility, but I think certainly our preference in the Senate at this juncture is for the House to take our provision and pass it, or take our bill and pass it. I think the House Rules Committee already met today, and I think the speaker is really wasting no time on moving forward on our bill, and I hope that they can pass it.
Trill Gates, ABC & FOX Alaska: Hi there, Senator, I had a question about Planned Parenthood. It’s my understanding two of the last Planned Parenthood locations, one in Anchorage, one in Fairbanks in our state, are now being threatened of being closed with this bill. Where will Alaskans in need of their services go?
Sen. Sullivan: I mean, there’s a lot of, I think there are other options with regard to services — community health centers throughout the state, which are all over the state. And I think the discussion, Trill, I think it used to be very bipartisan on what was called the Hyde Amendment, which was that federal funds should not be used to provide abortions. And that’s still the law of the land, but I think in terms of other services, for other health care type services — hospitals, community health centers, I think are areas in which those kinds of services can be provided.
Jeff Landfield, Alaska Landmine: I have more of a philosophical question. You know, we have the highest SNAP error rate, it was 60% I think, it might be down a little bit, but it’s much higher than the national average. And, you know, a third of the state is on Medicaid, and FMAP and the Indian Health Service, it’s a 100% match. Do you think the state needs to take steps to try to fix these problems and have people not so reliant on the federal government for health care and food stamps?
Sen. Sullivan: Well, Jeff, I think it’s a really important question. And our error rate on the SNAP provision the last couple years has been the highest in the country by far. It was 60% last year, which there’s not another state that’s even close to that. One of the things that we wanted to do on the SNAP provision we did get this in there, was to give states like ours with high error rates more time to fix the challenge. And I know the governor and the state Legislature are working on that. We were talking to the secretary of agriculture — Sen. Murkowski and I — with a provision we got in there that will grant her, essentially, the authority to let us go out to 2030 on fixing our error rate before any of the cost share provisions in the bill kicked in. And that was an important reform that we got in the bill. It was, you know, kind of trying to take care of our state in terms of getting control over this error rate, getting systems in place. You know, our error rate wasn’t always that high pre-COVID it was about 7% so I think COVID really undermined what happened in Alaska. 
So that’s one issue, and that’s a big part of the bill, and some of the somewhat Alaska-specific provisions that we got in the bill. The other one, though, I think, is a really important one, which is why I started my press conference with talking about private sector-led growth, giant great opportunities that are in this bill, historic opportunities that are in this bill. And I think you’re asking a really important question, because one thing that’s important is to make sure, and I did this in my speech to the Alaska Legislature earlier this year, is to say, ‘Hey, one of our goals should be to lift people off these programs.’ Remember Medicaid, if you’re disabled, pregnant, disabled, that’s who it was originally focused on. But, you know, you have the expansion population, which is 138% above the poverty level, able bodied. And you know, one of the goals I think we should talk about more is people in that category. Hey, there’s an opportunity with a really good job with the laborers or a great union that’s doing work on the (North) Slope. You get that job, you get great health care from the union, you get great private health care. You get off Medicaid, you have a stronger income coming in. So it’s an important issue that I think we need to remember that having more and more people on Medicaid and SNAP shouldn’t be the goal.  Those are safety nets that are very important, and I think they’re for Alaska, they are reinforced in this bill. But overall, I think we want to encourage people to be able to have jobs that move forward and get them, get them off those kinds of programs. 
And I also think that the work requirements are reforms that help in that way. Remember the Clinton administration did this with welfare reform, with 30 hours a week. It was considered controversial. I think a lot of people saw that it worked. This is about a third less in terms of requirement: 20 hours a week. And there’s a lot of ways in which individuals can meet that requirement. They can do volunteering, they can do training, they can go to school, they can get a job. So I think these kinds of reforms help in that direction that you’re asking and it’s important.
Ashlyn O’Hara, KDLL: Hi, Senator, I’d like to know more about the energy dominance financing program. I work for KDLL on the Kenai Peninsula, and there’s, of course, tremendous interest here about the Alaska LNG project. And are you able to be specific about how exactly the program would accelerate momentum on the project, and I guess as a kind of second part of that, or is it your intention to seek federal capital beyond the existing federal loan guarantees?
Sen. Sullivan: Ashlyn, great question, and the answer to your question is yes. One of the things that we are doing right now with Glenfarne (Group) and the Department of Defense is trying to see if there’s a way in which the Department of Defense can be a buyer of gas that would come down through the pipeline. That could dramatically lower the cost of capital, with regard to having a very big purchaser. Alaska LNG (pipeline) is going right past a lot of our military bases, so this is an issue I’ve raised with (U.S. Defense) Secretary Hegseth recently. I raised it in a breakfast I had with the deputy secretary of defense, just three weeks ago, and I raised it in a hearing with the assistant secretary for installations in charge of the Department of Defense. So the senior leaders of the Pentagon are very aware of this opportunity, and that Glenfarne is quite interested in that. 
And then, with regard to the Energy Dominance Council, what we did is we took, I think it’s called the Section 1706 provision that was in the IRA Act (Inflation Reduction Act), and we kind of reformed that to look at much bigger projects that relates to kind of big infrastructure, so nuclear, LNG and pipeline facilities, that can help increase capacity and base-load energy. That’s kind of the new way in which this 1706 energy dominance fund was reformed in the bill, and we got it capitalized with about a billion dollars. Which was important, because I was on a conference call with (U.S. Energy) Secretary Wright, and that’s the capitalization in the program. He is very interested in looking at the AKLNG project as one of the projects by which they would use this new energy dominance financing mechanism.
So they’re quite aware of it. We got a decent amount of money in it. I had a conference call with the secretary and the governor just two weeks ago. We are still trying to get the Department of Energy to set up the loan guarantees that Sen. Murkowski and I got in the bipartisan infrastructure bill several years ago. The Biden Administration never set that program up. It was four years of asking Secretary Granholm, hey, it’s in the law. We got it passed. You guys need to set it up. And they just kind of gave us the Heisman for four years. So we’re trying to get Secretary Wright and his team to set it up. So to answer your questions, you can kind of tell there are several different government financing angles that we are looking at. And if this law passes, this Energy Dominance Council will be a new one, and I think the secretary would like to target AKLNG as one of his projects.
Eric Stone, Alaska Public Media: Thanks, Senator. So I wanted to follow up on the idea that we’ll grow our way out of debt with the tax cuts. So like debt grew by $2.7 trillion between, shortly after the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, I’m going, you know, Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2020, this is before COVID. The debt grew by $2.7 trillion in that time. Why do you believe that extending these tax cuts further will, you know, help us grow our way out of debt, rather than adding to the national debt?
Sen. Sullivan: Because I don’t think you can cut your way out of a $36 trillion national debt, but I think the combination of savings – which this bill has very historic savings, about $1.6 trillion over 10 years – and growth, is really the key. And I think we’ve seen that throughout our country’s history. We’ve had different periods where we’ve had a very, very high debt-to-GDP ratio. That’s really the key indicator. Sometimes the numbers look daunting, but it’s really a measure of what your GDP is. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers thinks that this will help the GDP — debt-to-GDP go under 97%, with this bill because of the growth. It’ll be generated by it. And without it, they think it would be, you know, much higher, going about over 110%. 
So we’ve done this before, we grew out of a huge debt-to-GDP after World War II. I think on the growth side, after the 2017 tax cuts, you know, we were hitting 3% GDP growth. We were bringing in huge revenues. I think pre-tax cuts, it was about, I was looking at the numbers the other day, was about $3.5 trillion. It went up to almost $5 trillion, and then COVID hit and, you know, kind of all hell broke loose. So we had a very good, long meeting with the secretary of the treasury twice last week, and went through a lot of these numbers, and the Treasury Department thinks that we can hit them. But look, you never know. I mean, you’re asking a very fair question. There’s no doubt about it. But I think if you look at our history, the way you get out of these kinds of big holes, and we’re in a huge hole, is growth, is really, really the key.
Margaret Bauman, Cordova Times: Senator Sullivan, I want to go back to something you said at the beginning of the news conference, that “no state has fared better in this bill.” And you know, regarding issues like Medicaid and other economic issues, you’re very well traveled, and I just wonder how fair you think this is. Because the cost of living is high in Alaska, but there are absolutely pockets of extreme poverty all over this country. They’re in logging communities in the Rockies, they’re in Appalachia, they’re in little towns and big cities all over the country, because of the economic impact on individual families. There are families out there that are homeless, that don’t know where their next meal is coming from, and, you know, your obligation is to Alaska. But should Alaska be getting a hell of a better deal on all this than other states? Thank you.
Sen. Sullivan: Well, you’re right. I am focused on Alaska, and it’s hard to focus on other places. You’re right about there are other pockets of the country that have extreme poverty. We have extreme poverty, which is why, you know, we work really hard to get exemptions in so many parts of the legislation that relates to our state. And the other thing that we — I was really, really focused on, I’ve done it for a long time, as I mentioned this FMAP issue, but really, really pushed and got a big plus-up to the provider fund for rural hospitals and rural health care. That is a big deal to me. And in that fund, $50 billion is going to help states across America. As a matter of fact, the way in which we structure that fund, and my team and I were the ones who wrote the formula. We’re proud of this. We did not do it per capita. We’ve been down that road before. 
This fund has a minimum for every state across America, and that’s a $100 million minimum. Every state gets that. So to your question, that was something that my team and I devised, pushed hard on, funded significantly, and that helps every state. That’s not just an Alaska thing, but that’s going to help us huge. Because when you’re not per-capita income, sometimes we get the raw end of the deal on that. 
So, look, I’m not going to apologize for working hard for our state. That’s just my opinion. But back in D.C., there was a lot of chatter on the internet and stuff on how Alaska did really well in this bill: the energy part, the Coast Guard part, the military part, the tax part, the rural hospital fund. But I also think and I think you guys would all agree, we’ve been overlooked by the federal government, particularly in terms of infrastructure and health care, for years. Which is why I’m so obsessed with this FMAP provision, and when I couldn’t get it, when Schumer stripped it from the bill, we pivoted to this rural fund as a way to get those kinds of funds that we think our state needs. So it’s a good question, but as you can imagine, as a senator, I’m very, very, very focused on the people I represent. But I will say some of the initiatives that our team led on, like this big rural fund, are going to help everybody.

,DC,2025-07-03 02:45:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Abrego Garcia was beaten and tortured in Salvadoran prison, new court filings reveal",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-was-beaten-and-tortured-salvadoran-prison-new-court-filings-reveal,,"WASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported in March to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, endured “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” while there, his attorneys wrote in a late Wednesday filing.The filing, an amended complaint to the District Court of Maryland, provides the first disturbing details of what Abrego Garcia experienced at Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.His wrongful deportation has become the most high-profile example of the conflict between the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportations campaign and the judiciary’s call for the due process rights of immigrants.The allegations of torture also raise questions about the U.S. State Department’s payment to El Salvador of up to $15 million to detain about 300 immigrant men at CECOT, a possible violation of the human rights law known as the Leahy Law.The law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — such as military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.Hit with batons, forced to kneel for hoursWhen Abrego Garcia first arrived to CECOT, he was told by a prison official, “Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn’t leave,” according to the filing from lawyers with Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case.Abrego Garcia was later kicked, hit with wooden batons and beaten by Salvadoran guards on his first day at CECOT on March 15, according to the new filing.“By the following day, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia had visible bruises and lumps all over his body,” according to the complaint.While in a cell, Abrego Garcia and 20 other incarcerated Salvadorans were forced to kneel from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and guards would strike “anyone who fell from exhaustion,” according to the filing. During that time, Abrego Garcia was denied access to a bathroom and soiled himself.“The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation,” according to the complaint.At CECOT, the guards would threaten to put Abrego Garcia in cells with gang members “who, they assured him, would ‘tear’  him apart,” according to the filing. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied he is a gang member.During his first two weeks at CECOT, Abrego Garcia’s health deteriorated, and he lost 31 pounds, his attorneys said.Transfers to two more facilitiesOn April 9, Abrego Garcia and four others were transferred to a differentsector in CECOT, “where they were photographed with mattresses and better food—photos that appeared to be staged to document improved conditions,” according to his attorneys.Around April 10, he was later transferred alone to a separate prison facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador. On April 10, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia — who had deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador since 2019.But for months, the Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador, and the United States could not force El Salvador to return him.At the new location, Abrego Garcia “was frequently hidden from visitors, being told to remain in a separate room whenever outside visitors came to the facility,” according to the filing.“During his entire time in detention in El Salvador, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was denied any communication with his family and access to counsel until Senator (Chris) Van Hollen visited him on April 17, 2025,” according to the brief.The Maryland Democrat traveled to El Salvador in an effort to bring back Abrego Garcia, who is a longtime Maryland resident.Criminal chargesWhile Abrego Garica was returned to the U.S. last month, it was to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee while he was detained in El Salvador. His attorneys have denied the charges of human smuggling and say they are nothing more than the Trump administration trying to save face.Abrego Garcia’s criminal case is being handled out of a Tennessee court and he’s being kept in jail due to fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will deport him.Department of Justice attorneys stated in the District Court of Maryland last week that the Trump administration plans to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country, but said the move was not immediate.Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are trying to move forward with discovery to determine if the Trump administration flouted the district court’s order and the Supreme Court’s order in refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after the Trump administration admitted his deportation was a mistake.“Defendants’ disdain for the law and legal process, and their cruelty, shocks the conscience and demands immediate, sustained, judicial relief and oversight,” according to the complaint. “It also marks a profound constitutional crisis in which executive agencies have repeatedly and deliberately flouted the authority of multiple federal courts—including the Supreme Court itself.”“This defiance undermines the foundational principles of our constitutional system by eroding the checks and balances and rule of law that protect individual liberty from government overreach,” the attorneys continued.",,,,2025-07-02 23:01:38.885073

The order also directs the U.S. Marshals to hold him “separately from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal” and to ensure he is able to privately confer with his attorneys.
Abrego, an apprentice sheet metal worker living in Maryland, was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March after a traffic stop as the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts.

A government lawyer later admitted Abrego, who entered the country illegally about a decade ago, had been deported in error. A 2019 order from an immigration judge prevents him from being deported to his native El Salvador due to fears of gang violence. The Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return.
A grand jury indictment unsealed June 6 alleged Abrego served for years as a paid driver to transport immigrants who had crossed the U.S. border illegally to points around the country.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Attorneys for Abrego, who initially sought his pretrial release over the objection of federal prosecutors, last week asked for a delay due to “contradictory statements” made by government officials over his potential deportation.

Both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys have conceded he will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials should he be granted pretrial release.
But government attorneys in Abrego’s separate immigration case told a Maryland judge last week that they expected ICE to begin the process of sending Abrego to a “third country.” The attorneys did not provide a timeline.
A White House spokesperson later denied Abrego would face imminent deportation.
In arguing their client be temporarily kept in jail, Abrego’s attorneys acknowledged the “irony” of their request.
“In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further. And yet the government — a government that has, at all levels, told the American people that it is bringing Mr. Abrego back home to the United States to face ‘American justice’ — apparently has little interest in actually bringing this case to trial.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections announced that 35 men arrested and detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state and held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex were transferred out of state on Monday.
ICE transferred 42 men to Alaska from out of state on June 8, as part of an ongoing agreement between the Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, amid a nationwide deportation crackdown. The move sparked daily protests, a fact-finding hearing by the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, and concerns from attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska around the punitive conditions of detention, violations of due process and criminal confinement.
A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said department Commissioner Jen Winkelman was not available for an interview on Tuesday to discuss the transfer, concerns around conditions of detention, and ongoing plans to house ICE detainees in Alaska.
“The ICE detainees who were transferred due to severe overcrowding in the Washington facility are no longer in the custody of the Alaska Department of Corrections,” said DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley in an email, in which she included the italics and underlining. She added that all questions on the details of the transfer should be directed to DHS/ICE.
Cindy Woods, a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, said the transfer was not unexpected, since DOC had said they agreed to hold detainees for 30 days. She also said she and several other attorneys were not notified of the transfers.
“Yesterday evening, I flagged the attorneys that I know represent folks who had been transferred, to let them know that they were being transferred again, and but none of them had been told by ICE prior to that,” she said.
Woods said all the detainees were going through civil immigration proceedings, and faced no criminal charges.
“These individuals were all in civil detention, so they were not being detained as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding. They were all in administrative immigration proceedings,” she said, and a number of the men have applied for or received asylum protections.
“And then there were also a handful of folks who were waiting for their immigration proceedings to commence,” she said. “And so (they) were waiting for the opportunity to speak with a judge about either a potential asylum claim or some other request for immigration relief.”
The ICE transfer of detainees to Alaska DOC custody raised serious concerns around standards of detention from legislators and advocates. Attorneys testified before the June 20 hearing of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee that despite no criminal charges, their clients reported that they were subject to lengthy lockdowns, overuse of handcuffs and overcrowding — sleeping three to a cell. In addition, they were denied or had limited access to calls with family and attorneys, regularly strip-searched after visits with attorneys, and subjected to use of force by DOC staff members, who pepper-sprayed a unit to stop a “verbal demonstration” on June 12, the attorneys said.
The ACLU of Alaska sent a letter on Saturday to Alaska state officials and ICE demanding detainees be removed from Anchorage Correctional Complex custody, and a stop to any additional transfers “unless and until constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement and attorney access can be guaranteed.”
The letter provided further detail on the pepper-spray incident: “This ‘verbal demonstration’ consisted of detainees requesting access to their belongings, including an individual who was trying to access his property to get the phone number for his consulate. Following the incident, many individuals experienced respiratory distress, including coughing, burning sensations in their mouth, nose, and eyes, and nosebleeds, and did not receive medical attention. They were also unable to change their clothes for an extended period of time.”
Holley said in the Department of Corrections’ emailed response to an interview request that the state did not make the call to transfer the detainees.
“The decision to transfer these detainees out of Alaska rested solely with the federal government. The decision was not influenced by the recent House Judiciary Committee hearing or the letter issued by the ACLU this past weekend,” Holley said.
“It is important to note the Alaska DOC routinely houses both civil detainees and federal prisoners. While we do not currently know whether ICE will request additional placements in the future, the Alaska DOC remains fully prepared to support DHS/ICE in coordinated efforts that prioritize public safety and the efficient use of government resources.”
The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans.
Woods said the DOC protocols and detention conditions are unnecessary, and violated the men’s right to due process. “The conditions that they were all held in were punitive, whether or not that was the intention of the government, and such punitive nature are clearly outside the scope of the law, and especially when it comes to the standards and the requirements for civil detainees, who are not being held under criminal charges,” she said.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment about why the detainees were transferred to and from Alaska. Woods said she was able to search in the ICE inmate locator and confirm the men were transferred back to the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, with reportedly better conditions.
Woods said detainees reported the experience in DOC custody as humiliating.
“They were being held in really substandard conditions, being subjected to pepper spray and strip searches, and handcuffs, and all of those things. And so it was really hard for a lot of people to deal with that shift,” she said, referring to being transferred from Washington state to Alaska custody. “And especially because they were also largely cut off from those outside relationships that sustained them, particularly those who, you know, regularly spoke with their children and their parents and their loved ones who were not located in the United States — having that kind of completely shut off really impacted the individuals who experienced that.”
On Friday, seven U.S. congressional representatives from Washington and Oregon sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security questioning why detainees were transferred to Alaska,  as well as the cost and criteria for who is transferred. The letter also raised concerns that “ICE is wasting taxpayer dollars, flying dozens of people between detention centers thousands of miles apart, in efforts that do nothing to help protect Americans.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of concerned Utah health, food aid and housing advocates rallied together on a virtual call Wednesday to raise alarms about “devastating” fallout if the massive tax and spending bill that’s been dubbed President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” gets approved.
Estimates for how many people in Utah would be affected have been a moving target as the bill has made its way through Congress, but advocates warn tens of thousands could lose Medicaid coverage and thousands more in Utah who rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), could be at risk of losing food benefits. 
They also warned “lives are at stake” because the proposed cuts could especially threaten Utah’s rural hospitals and clinics, which could lead to reduced access to healthcare. Further, they said the cuts would have far-reaching effects that would lead to job losses, increased hunger, and declining health for people across the nation, including Utah. 
Analysis: Upwards of 80K Utahns could lose health insurance under ‘big, beautiful’ bill’

“Over 60,000 Utahns could lose Medicaid coverage because of these cuts, which we know will hit rural Utah particularly hard,” said Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, which is also a member of the Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition. “On top of the coverage loss many Utahns — including children, those who are low income, who have disabilities, who are aging — will also now face greater insecurity.” 
Crippes said “thousands of jobs” across Utah could be at risk due to economic fallout from the cuts. 
“While the impacts on some communities will be abrupt,” he said, “the aftershock will be felt by all Utahns.” 
After the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill Tuesday, it now awaits another vote in the U.S. House. Wednesday, the bill hit a roadblock as far-right members of the House GOP objected to the Senate’s version. Members of the House Freedom Caucus balked at several provisions in the sprawling bill, including that it would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion. 
But a vote in the House still looms. And though advocates acknowledged their complaints may be falling on deaf ears from Utah’s all-Republican congressional delegation, they said they’re not going to stop fighting or give up hope — even if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP get approved. 
They urged Utahns to do the same — not give up. 
“Whether there’s hope or not, the correct thing for anybody individually to do is still to contact your Congress person and make the effort,” said Neil Rickard, a child nutrition advocate with the advocacy group Utahns Against Hunger. “At the very worst, you’ve emphasized that these are very real issues. Whatever happens with the outcome of this bill, the core issues that we’re talking about right now are still going to exist.” 
But if the bill does pass? Rickard said the fight to restore Medicaid and SNAP benefits is just beginning. 
“We have a huge problem on our hands and we need to start addressing it,” he said. “It’s very bad … but the work does not stop.”
‘Absolutely the wrong time’ to shift SNAP costs to states
Among the advocates who warned against the cuts Wednesday was Glenn Bailey, executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, which he described as the “agency of last resort” that provides food pantry assistance to low-income Utahns.

He said SNAP and Medicaid help people from “falling through the cracks” and ending up in food pantries to begin with. Today, Bailey said Crossroads Urban Center serves up to 13,000 people every month between its two food pantries, “and the need is continuing to go up” amid Utah’s increasing housing costs. 
“This is absolutely the wrong time to make cuts in the safety net, particularly in food resources that help single parents,” Bailey said. He added that adding “red tape” like work requirements or other barriers would be a “big mistake,” especially “for the most vulnerable people in our communities.” 
If the bill passes, Bailey said the federal government will be “spending a whole lot more money and exploding the national deficit in order to do less for the people who need it the most.”
“It’s a big mistake,” he said. 
How would Utah deal with the cuts? Former legislator weighs in
Marsha Judkins, a moderate Republican from Provo who is a former Utah legislator who served on the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee for six years, said the cuts will likely affect Utahns who need the services rather than weed out fraud because, she said, fraud in Utah’s programs is rare.
Judkins, who did not seek reelection last year, said she’s seen first-hand how legislators are “very careful about the money received from the federal government.” 
“The Medicaid and SNAP programs in Utah have very little fraud, misuse or waste,” she said. “The application process is very rigorous, and the clients on these programs are often reviewed to make sure that they still qualify.”
The proposed cuts could lead to several possible scenarios, she said, but “all of them have some fairly severe consequences to every-day Utahns.” 
“Legislators could decide to make the cuts permanent, and then they would either cut people from the programs or cut the benefits they are receiving,” she said. “Who would be cut and the services that would be cut? New moms, possibly receiving postpartum care. Addiction recovery. Services for those who have serious mental illness. Children who have complex health needs. Patients battling cancer.”

While proponents argue the cuts are meant to go after people committing fraud, Judkins said, “in Utah we simply don’t have that problem, and it’s going to be real people who are going to be cut. And they’re going to be cut from programs that they truly need.” 
She also warned that “unintended consequences” could be increased hospital costs, increased hospital visits, longer wait times for care, and increases in health insurance premiums, “and that’s just to name a few.” 
Rural hospitals at risk
Matthew McCollough, rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association, warned rural hospitals are especially at risk from the cuts. 
Roughly 1,300 “critical access” hospitals, or hospitals that are located in rural and underserved areas, currently exist across the U.S., with an average operating margin of only 2.5%, “so they’re barely getting by,” he said. He added that 46% of rural hospitals are operating with a budget deficit, while in states that have not expanded Medicaid, 53% of those hospitals are operating in the red. 
He added that 188 rural hospitals nationwide have already closed or converted to a rural emergency hospital status “because they were unable to keep the doors open.” And about 432 rural hospitals are already vulnerable to closure. 
“And that’s today,” he said, adding that the federal cuts would only further jeopardize “an already very vulnerable, fragile rural healthcare system.” 
He stressed that it’s important to realize “these are real people that need care.”

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion.
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect.
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.”
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law.
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April.
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.”
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.”
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state.
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Attorney General Josh Kaul, who brought the lawsuit against the law, said at a Wednesday morning news conference that the decision was an important step toward ensuring all Wisconsinites have the freedom to access abortion care, but that the Legislature should step up and further clarify the law.
“I thought we were right on the law. The arguments we made have now been vindicated,” Kaul said. “But at a time when the rights of Wisconsinites and Americans are under threat, this case is a stark reminder of how important it is that we fight for our rights, that we advocate for what is in the best interest of the people of our state, and that we stand on the side of freedom. Here today, we were able to achieve a significant victory for the freedom of Wisconsinites.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care.
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion.
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.”
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929.
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.”
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case.
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”

Meanwhile, the voting-rights group that filed the lawsuit is urging a federal court not to dismiss the case. 
The post Trump’s DOJ sides with Gray in voter registration lawsuit appeared first on WyoFile .","As a federal court prepares to make a key ruling on a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law, the U.S. Department of Justice weighed in Tuesday, filing a statement of interest in the case. 
“This court should maintain the long-held position that preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence are legitimate state interests,” the department’s Civil Rights Division argued in its filing. 
In its own pair of motions, Equality State Policy Center, which filed the lawsuit in May, urged the court Monday not to dismiss the case, arguing the new law “threatens voting rights.”
The law, which took effect Tuesday, makes proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship part of the voter registration process in Wyoming. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days. 
Such regulations are unconstitutionally vague and impose an undue burden on the right to vote, the lawsuit alleges. It names Secretary of State Chuck Gray in his official capacity as a defendant in the case, along with all 23 county clerks. 
The complaint’s profile has risen considerably since it was initially filed, first attracting high-profile attorneys to both sides of the case, then the attention of the Republican National Committee and a coalition of 25 states and Guam. Now, the Trump administration wants to have a say. 
“Requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote is a valid method for a State to achieve its interests in preventing fraud and safeguarding voter confidence in elections,” according to the DOJ’s filings. 
In a poll prior to November’s election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in 2024 to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
Gray, in a press release, welcomed the federal government’s involvement. 
“I am extremely grateful for President Trump’s and the DOJ’s leadership and prioritization of these important election integrity measures,” he said.
The harms described in the federal lawsuit are speculative, Gray’s attorneys have argued, and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court. They’ve alleged that the nonprofit can’t point to specific examples of voters who will be disenfranchised by the new law.
In Monday’s filings, attorneys for ESPC pushed back on Gray’s suggestion, arguing that they’ve “submitted concrete evidence” and pointing to “three separate declarants attesting that they serve individuals who lack the identifying documents [the law] requires.”
“Secretary Gray is also incorrect that no voters facing a disproportionate impact are before the court,” the filing states. “For example, Plaintiff highlights the experience of domestic abuse survivors, thousands of whom live in Wyoming. These survivors are before the court as constituents of the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, one of the Plaintiff’s member organizations. And Plaintiff can adjudicate that harm on their behalf.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
Both parties have pointed to a legal doctrine known as Anderson-Budrick balancing, which “requires courts to weigh burdens that a state imposes on electoral participation against the state’s asserted benefits,” according to SCOTUSblog. 
But Gray’s attorneys have misconstrued the doctrine in his filings, according to ESPC’s motion, and “the Secretary offers no legally meaningful defense of the law. Thus, under binding precedent, and on this record, the Court should find Plaintiff is likely to succeed.” 
ESPC also filed a motion Monday opposing a proposed amicus brief from Guam and 25 states, including those that have passed similar voter registration laws to Wyoming. 
“For all states may posture during legislative sessions (or in amicus briefs) about the specter of non-citizen voting, the fact remains that there is no evidence that it is an actual problem — in Wyoming or anywhere else — and the amici tellingly point to none,” the filing states. 
The court made two decisions on Wednesday. 
For one, it set a deadline for ESPC to object to a separate proposed amicus brief from the Immigration Reform Law Institute — a legal nonprofit affiliated with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which was founded by white nationalist and anti-immigration activist John Tanton. Plaintiffs have until Tuesday to do so. 
The court also granted a motion designating the county clerks as nominal parties, meaning they will technically remain a part of the case but will not have any responsibilities. 
In the meantime, the court must still rule on the plaintiff’s request to halt enforcement of the new law pending the lawsuit’s outcome.

“This legislation will kill economic growth and jobs, raise energy prices, and cede clean energy technology manufacturing to other countries,” said Carly Ebben Eaton, Wisconsin Policy Manager for the Blue Green Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.
Eaton took part in two online news conferences Wednesday to draw attention to the federal budget reconciliation bill and its repeal of key portions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The budget bill has been the top priority of the Republican majority in Congress as well as the administration of President Donald Trump. It was drawn up to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump’s first term that will expire at the end of 2025.
The package returned to the U.S. House for final action after a tied vote in the U.S. Senate that required Vice President JD Vance to pass the measure on Tuesday.
Steep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition programs have drawn the most attention during debate on the bill, along with the Congressional Budget Office finding that the wealthiest taxpayers will benefit most from its tax cuts.
The bill also includes measures that would undo several provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the signature pieces of legislation enacted during President Joe Biden’s four years in office. After its passage the act was lauded by environmental advocates for provisions to address climate change by encouraging clean energy through tax credits as well as federal investments.
The House version of the GOP bill “already dealt a serious blow to clean energy tax credits and investments,” Eaton said Wednesday, “but the Senate took it even further, doubling down on cuts that will cost jobs, stall progress and raise energy costs.”
Consumer, business renewable energy incentives
The IRA’s tax breaks were designed to encourage consumers to move to energy-efficient and clean energy appliances and vehicles and encourage utilities and other businesses to increase their use of renewable resources such as solar energy and wind power.
Eaton said Wednesday that clean energy tax credits are supporting more than $8.6 billion in private investments in Wisconsin.
Garrik Harwick, assistant business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union Local 890 in Janesville, said that over the past three years more than 300 members have worked on solar projects in Southern Wisconsin. He spoke at a news conference with Eaton and several other union leaders.
The IRA tax breaks have encouraged those developments, Harwick said, and the investments have included increased apprenticeship slots, bringing in new trainees.
“These investments don’t just deliver clean energy,” Harwick added. “They create good paying union jobs that strengthen our local communities.”
He warned that repealing the tax credit will likely reduce the use of clean energy technologies and increase energy costs by 6% for homeowners and more than 9% for business customers.
The IRA’s provisions that encouraged apprenticeships helped “open doors that many didn’t even know existed,” said Andy Buck, government affairs director for the Wisconsin and Upper Michigan district of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.
He said the union has added a number of jobs, including apprentices, installing energy-efficient glass in buildings on projects that were facilitated by the Inflation Reduction Act.
“When someone enters a registered apprenticeship program, they aren’t just learning a trade,” Buck said. “They’re building a career, gaining self-respect, and finding a path to a better life.”
Another provision of the 2022 law opened up tax credits for renewable energy to nonprofit organizations and government agencies, allowing them to receive direct payments to the federal government comparable to the value they’d receive from the tax credit if they paid taxes.
A new middle school being built in Menasha will include solar panels and energy storage, said Matt VanderPuy, a business agent for the Sheet Metal workers union in Sheboygan. The direct pay program will reimburse the district $3 million, he said, while the energy savings is projected at $190,000 per year.
“This is money that they can reinvest into the students, the teachers and the school district,” while saving on property taxes, VanderPuy said.
‘Very ugly impacts,’ says advocate
At another news conference, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes observed that more than 90% of the jobs that IRA incentives helped create are in Republican congressional districts — although no Republicans in the state delegation voted for the bill. Barnes leads Forward Wisconsin, a nonprofit established during Biden’s term in the White House to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.
But business uncertainty this year, which Barnes blamed on GOP positions including Trump’s tariff executive orders, has led nationally to the cancellation of projects worth $15.5 billion, he said.
“The so-called big beautiful bill is going to have some very ugly impacts in Wisconsin, ripping away tax incentives for wind and solar farms, for rooftop solar, for farm sustainability programs, for clean cars and school buses,” said Amy Barrilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, at the event with Barnes. “And giving more tax breaks to big oil and gas companies does absolutely nothing to create jobs here or any opportunities here — it’s a gift to big oil at the expense of Wisconsin families and at the expense of our environment.”
Heather Allen, policy director for Elevate, an energy efficiency nonprofit, said as many as 11,000 clean energy and manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin could be at risk.
Plans for a $2.5 billion network of electric vehicle charging stations in the state have stalled, Allen said, and Wisconsin manufacturers that would have supplied components “are going to lose that opportunity now.”
“This legislation is going to strangle our solar businesses with red tape,” Allen said. “What you have here is an attack on small businesses that are delivering clean energy solutions to help families save money on their energy bills. And that includes solar installers, but it also includes other home energy contractors, other construction jobs.”
In four recent polls, a majority of those surveyed disapproved of the Republicans’  megabill — making it “more unpopular than any piece of major legislation that’s been passed since at least 1990,” Barnes said.
At the labor news conference, Emily Pritzkow, the Wisconsin Building Trades Council executive director, said advocates are urging people to contact their members of Congress.
“The polling on this is abysmal, and as long as people continue to call and deliver that message , that is what we need to do right now,” Pritzkow said. “Now is the time to weigh in, not once it’s coming to your front door, impacting you, your community, and people you care about.”

(Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)Even as U.S. House struggled to wrangle the votes to pass President Donald Trump’s major domestic policy initiative Wednesday, Minnesota progressives, food shelves and health care advocates sounded the alarm over the “big, beautiful bill” that would deliver steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid for low-income families.
“There are seniors who will not have care because of this bill. There are Minnesota low-income college students who will not be able to go to college because of this bill. There are people who will not be able to get health care, and people who get health care who are paying thousands of dollars more because of this bill,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, at a Wednesday rally in Minnehaha Park.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed Trump’s plan that would extend 2017 tax cuts and slashes spending on the Medicaid program for low-income people and people with disabilities. The legislation also shifts significant costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to states for the first time.
The U.S. House passed its own version of the bill in May and now House Republicans are facing pressure to pass the Senate’s version before Trump’s self-imposed Friday deadline. The Senate’s version includes steeper cuts to Medicaid compared to the House, though the House’s most far-right members want even more cuts and have threatened to withhold their votes if they don’t get their way.
Because of the tax cuts and increases in spending on defense and immigration enforcement, the plan would add about $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The richest 5% of American taxpayers would receive 44% of the net tax cuts next year, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
The bill would hit state Medicaid programs across the country. All told, changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the Senate bill would cause 12 million additional people to be without health coverage in the next decade.
Over 1.2 million Minnesotans receive health care through Medicaid, known as Medical Assistance in Minnesota, and the congressional cuts would impact people’s health care coverage or their ability to access care. Many of Minnesota’s rural hospitals see a high rate of Medicaid patients, and they could see increased costs through uncompensated care.
Fair Share America rolled a dollar-green bus into Minnehaha Park Tuesday, where advocates and legislators gathered to protest the bill. It was part of the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway,” a cross-country bus tour with a focus on the bill’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
Several Minnesota legislators and advocates gave speeches to a group of roughly 40 people, who staved off the summer heat with fans shaped like dollar bills.
Jerry Guritz, 72, and John Heidelberger, 72, attended the rally together. Sitting in the front row, they had signs reading “Tax the Rich” and “No Kings.” It was the first action Heidelberger had attended since the early 80s when he protested with the Teamsters.
“We’ve got to quit giving the richest people a free pass. They’ve got to pay their share. That’s where the revenue is going to come from, to aid all of the rest of us. I mean, the billionaires made their money off of the workers. Whichever industry it’s in, they’ve had workers,” Heidelberger said.
Zach Rodvold, public affairs director for Second Harvest Heartland, said that food shelves across Minnesota have seen a vast increase in demand, which will be exacerbated if the bill passes.
“This could affect benefits for as many as 150,000 Minnesotans in the near term through cuts to benefits, or outright stripping people of their benefits altogether,” Rodvold said in a virtual press conference Wednesday. “Over time, it will affect every Minnesota SNAP participant because it makes it harder for benefits to keep up with costs over the next 10 years.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0035-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

Kelly Armstrong hold a press conference to show their support for the reconciliation bill passed by the Senate earlier this week. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Amid national controversy over Congress’ “big, beautiful bill,” U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., promised the legislation will bring tax relief to North Dakota residents.
The nearly 1,000-page bill was approved in the Senate on Tuesday. The House now must reconcile the Senate’s version of the legislation with the package it passed in May.
Hoeven and other Republican members of Congress have cheered the bill for its tax cuts, protections for farmers and investment into immigration enforcement and deportations.
Hoeven highlighted that the Senate version of the bill will reduce taxes by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Higher-income Americans and corporations would see the largest tax cuts, though both chambers’ packages also propose tax reductions on tips. 
US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against Freedom Caucus resistance

“These are the fundamentals that make our state stronger,” he said at a Wednesday press conference with Gov. Kelly Armstrong in Bismarck. “Now we’re getting these things implemented at the federal level.”
Critics of the “big, beautiful bill” argue it would push millions of Americans off of Medicaid, undermine other social safety net programs like food stamps and grow the national debt.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in an analysis published Tuesday said the bill would add $3.4 trillion in deficits over the next decade.
Armstrong, a former member of Congress, said he is generally skeptical of the office’s numbers and that its analysis of the bill low-balls the positive effects it would have on the economy.
“I think they drastically, drastically underestimate the impact for North Dakota,” he said.
A Legislative Council analysis of the bill published last week also estimated that it would reduce Medicaid enrollment in North Dakota by roughly 18% within the next 10 years, in part due to proposed changes to eligibility requirements that would force all able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work.
Hoeven said the only people who would lose access to Medicaid under the bill are people who can work but choose not to.
“For all the traditional Medicaid population, nobody loses their Medicaid,” he said.
The reconciliation bill has also caught criticism for proposing changes to SNAP, the nutrition program formerly known as food stamps. The House bill would require states to pay a percentage of food benefit costs for the first time. The Senate proposes only implementing this change for states that can’t get their error payment rates below a certain percentage. Error payment rates measure how accurately states determine who qualifies for SNAP and how much assistance to give them.
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

Hoeven also said that both chambers’ bills increase the child tax credit, which currently is $2,000 per child. The House proposed increasing the credit to $2,500, while the Senate proposed increasing it to $2,200.
North Dakota’s two other Congressional delegates, Sen. Kevin Cramer and Rep. Julie Fedorchak, also voted in favor of the package.
The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party in a statement earlier this week criticized the package as potentially devastating for people who rely on federal social programs.
“North Dakota taxpayers will be left holding the bag when our elected officials rubber stamp this disastrous bill,” Rep. Zac Ista, House minority leader for the North Dakota Legislature, said in the announcement.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Pennsylvania education leaders are scrambling after the Trump Administration said it would withhold more than $230 million in congressionally approved funding for after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Education said the U.S. Department of Education informed officials Monday evening of a delay in the release of funding that was due to be available starting Tuesday. 
The action is separate from the budget reconciliation bill pending final approval in the U.S. House.
Education advocates told the Capital-Star on Wednesday the failure to release the funds was reckless and unlawful and would affect the commonwealth’s most vulnerable students.
“These federal funds support key programs that expand learning for our most underserved students,” Maura McInerney, legal director of the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the announcement caught state and local school officials off guard, which came days after the deadline for school districts to approve their budgets.
The uncertainty also arrived as the General Assembly continues negotiations over the state budget.
According to an analysis by Education Week, the $230 million due Pennsylvania is the sixth largest amount among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. 
Schweyer said he learned of the funding freeze from a school superintendent in his legislative district who had received a “terse” email from the state. He learned further details about the Trump administration’s decision from a New York Times article.
“To say we had no idea this is coming is absolutely accurate,” Schweyer said.
The federal Education Department referred questions to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond.
He said the funding freeze comes as many school districts and partner organizations are working to finalize agreements and hire staff for after school and summer programs. Rural communities where independent nonprofit organizations such as the YMCA and Jewish community centers are less common are likely to be hit harder, he said.
“The Trump administration is beyond reckless. This Congress is beyond impotent. They’re hurting the families we all collectively serve,” Schweyer said.
Funding for seven federal programs totaling nearly $7 billion nationwide is affected. Five of the programs support K-12 schools, while the other two help schools, community colleges and other organizations provide adult literacy and civics education.

McInerney said the programs benefit children affected by poverty through summer school and after-school tutoring and enrichment programs; immigrant students and English learners, children of migrant workers; youth in the foster care system and juvenile justice system; and adults seeking basic education as a pathway to post-secondary education and employment. 
The state Education Department  provided estimates of the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education, $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction, $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition, $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States, $20 million

“We are assessing the impact of this delay and will keep school leaders and local programs informed. We are also determining any next steps,” department spokesperson Erin James said. “PDE will continue to share updates as they become available and is committed to supporting Pennsylvania schools, educators, and learners throughout this process.”
McInerney said withholding the funds is a violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which regulates how the president can delay or rescind spending that has already been approved by Congress.
“The unilateral withholding of these congressionally appropriated funding streams without any justification or warning to Congress is outrageous and unlawful.  The administration cannot unilaterally delay or cancel appropriations already enacted into law. Only Congress holds this constitutional power,” McInerney said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shauneen-doe-building-exterior_0-1024x7681742509292-1.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, addresses the House of Delegates during a floor session on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan shared more details Wednesday regarding the proof he says he’s collected showing Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, was not responsible for making an antisemitic comment on Instagram last month.
McGeehan — in an interview for WRNR TV — said he personally investigated the accusation against Masters and found the person who he says left the comment from an Instagram account that was using Masters’ full name and that linked to the Citizens Defense League, where Masters once served as president.
The comment in question was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. 
In a June 25th interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters denied leaving the comment and said he didn’t have “any active Instagram account.” The next day, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, told MetroNews Talkline that Masters told him the @NoQuarterMasters account used to be his, but he no longer used it. 
According to McGeehan’s radio interview, Masters knew the person who allegedly left the comment through his late brother. When Masters was visiting his hometown in Hancock County “sometime last year,” McGeehan said he ran into the “younger guy” and wanted to help him.
“… [Masters] gave resources to him — gave money, he gave him his old iPhone which didn’t have any cellular service, but you could work it with WiFi or whatever,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan said Masters’ social media accounts, including Instagram, were still logged in on the phone. The person opened them, McGeehan said, and used Masters’ account to leave the antisemitic comment.
“I don’t even think he knew he was on [Masters’] account,” McGeehan said.
McGeehan would not name the individual who he claims made the comment, saying he was “very sick,” “basically homeless” and living with substance use disorder after a recent extended hospital stay where he woke up from an almost two-month-long coma.
“Look, this is a guy that is probably going to eventually die in the near future, either from the disease he has or from overdosing on the narcotics he’s been prescribed to deal with it,” McGeehan said. “… so I’m not getting [him] involved.”
West Virginia Watch left a voicemail for McGeehan on Tuesday afternoon. He responded via text: “Do not contact me.”
When asked by WRNR host Bill Stubblefield if law enforcement should be getting involved as the person who left the comment “hacked” an elected official and impersonated him online, McGeehan laughed.
“Ha. No. This is over as far as I’m concerned,” McGeehan said. “… There’s a lot of things that would go into [an official investigation] and I’m not going to have some sort of witch hunt. I’ve done due diligence.”
Shortly after Masters’ interview with West Virginia Watch last week, the name on the account was changed from “Ian T. Masters” to “I. Masters.” Masters told Hanshaw, according to MetroNews, that he couldn’t access the account and needed tech support from Instagram to change the password. 
The profile picture on the @NoQuarterMasters account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia — where Masters grew up, McGeehan said Wednesday. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. 
McGeehan said the letter in the profile picture was from Masters’ late brother, who died by suicide in 2014. The runes, McGeehan said, were “symbols from Scandinavian Norse mythology” and were meant to be an “homage” to Masters’ brother as the two grew up reading Norse literature.
The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals.
Masters has not commented publicly on this situation, however he is scheduled to give an interview to WRNR on Thursday morning. He could not be reached by phone on Wednesday.
The state Democratic Party has called on Speaker Hanshaw to perform a “full forensic investigation” of Masters’ devices, social media accounts and email; seek an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it as well as how the name and bio on the account were changed after his interview with West Virginia Watch if he did not have access to the account.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pat-McGeehan-20240202.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

The council, a nonprofit which distributes funds to 52 family planning centers in Missouri and three in Oklahoma, has been operating without key federal funding for three months. It received notice last week that funds were being restored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Wednesday, a letter arrived awarding the organization another year of Title X funding.
The decades-old Title X program funds access to family-planning options, like contraception, cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases. In fiscal year 2024, MFHC received $8.5 million from the program, covering 56,000 patient visits at clinics.
“While we had raised emergency funds to support health centers in providing services, those funds were dwindling,” the nonprofit’s executive director Michelle Trupiano told The Independent. “We and our health centers were about to make some really tough decisions about how to keep doors open and keep services.”
At the end of March, the Trump Administration froze Title X funding to 16 nonprofits in an effort to crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts barred by the President’s executive order. Nearly one in five grantees were impacted. Missouri was one of seven states that, as a result of the suspension, no longer had Title X funds, according to a KFF Health News report.
Trupiano said that the federal government requested information on MFHC and the clinics it helps fund, looking into discrimination policies. MFHC submitted the requested documents and didn’t hear back until the letter of restoration came last week.
“We hadn’t done anything wrong to begin with,” Trupiano said. “Therefore, it’s unclear what we did to correct it because they did not ask us any follow-up questions.”
The Missouri Family Health Council is one of four nonprofits to get funding restored. Others continue to operate without Title X funding or are forced to close doors.
At the end of May, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ohio stopped operations, citing the loss of Title X funds.
There is an active lawsuit filed by the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the federal government’s withholding of the funds. Missouri Family Health Council is mentioned in the complaint.
Despite the restoration of funds, Trupiano is anxious about the future of Title X, especially given that President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget request includes cutting all Title X family-planning grants.
“We are concerned about what the future holds,” she said. “That is why we are so relieved that this funding was released so that the health centers can provide as much care to as many people as they can for as long as they can.”

“We’ve already had 600 fires start in Washington” this year, Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove said during a press conference Wednesday. Four hundred of those fires were on state-owned land, he added.
“Don’t be an idiot, don’t set our state on fire this weekend, and have a fun, safe Fourth of July,” Upthegrove said. 
Citing data that shows fireworks were responsible for 156 injuries and 271 fires in Washington last year, with the highest concentration of incidents occurring on the Fourth of July, the state fire marshal is encouraging residents to view fireworks at a public display rather than igniting their own. 
For those who do choose to set off their own fireworks, the fire marshal advises them to only use legal, consumer-grade fireworks that don’t show signs of tampering or damage. Officials also warn against pointing fireworks at others or consuming alcohol when handling fireworks. And they advise keeping sparklers and fireworks away from anyone’s body, and having a water source like a bucket or a hose nearby. 
It’s legal to buy or sell fireworks in Washington until 9 p.m. on July 5. 
Under state law, fireworks can only be discharged between noon and 11 p.m. from June 28 through July 5.  
Some counties and cities across Washington have their own fireworks restrictions that supersede state guidelines. 
With much of the state abnormally dry or in drought, counties in eastern and western Washington have also already been imposing burn bans this summer.
As of Wednesday, InciWeb, the federal website that displays wildfire information, showed a roughly 1,900-acre, lightning-sparked fire burning in north-central Washington, mostly in the Glacier Peak Wilderness. It had not led to evacuations and was not threatening any structures.
Fireworks are prohibited year-round on all public lands in Washington, including state parks, beaches and land managed by federal and state agencies. 
After volunteers removed over 129,000 pounds of trash from Washington beaches last Fourth of July weekend, Washington State Parks is asking beach visitors to clean up after themselves and pack out their trash this year. 
To help reduce litter, volunteers with Grassroots Garbage Gang will hand out garbage bags to visitors at the Seaview, Sid Snyder, Bolstad, Cranberry, Klipsan, Ocean Park and Oysterville beach approaches from 4 to 8 p.m. on July 4. 
Washington State Parks and a handful of nonprofits, including Washington CoastSavers, Grassroots Garbage Gang, Surfrider Olympia and Grays Harbor Surfrider, will also host volunteer beach cleanup events along the coast from 9 a.m. to noon on July 5. 
In addition to the year-round fireworks ban, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is restricting several fire-related activities on land it manages in eastern Washington until further notice due to increased wildfire risk.  
Restricted activities include campfires, target shooting, smoking, welding, operating chainsaws, and operating a motor vehicle away from developed roads. 
“This year’s forecast shows an increased risk of wildfires statewide,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Lands Division Manager Kevin Connally said in a statement. “These restrictions help protect local communities, as well as critical wildlife habitat, and we all have a responsibility to our shared outdoor spaces.” 
July 2 marks National Wildland Firefighter Day. Upthegrove and several fire officials took time Wednesday to honor three Idaho firefighters who were shot Sunday in an ambush in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, while responding to a brush fire, as well as Washington firefighters who died in the line of duty last year. 
“One of the best ways we can honor those that are putting their lives on the line is to do our part to reduce the risk of wildfire, to prevent folks from having to go out and respond in the first place,” Upthegrove said during the press conference, held in Ellensburg. 
Fire season preparation in Washington was made more difficult this year by state budget cuts and federal layoffs, “but we’re ready, at the Department of Natural Resources, thanks to strong partnerships with other agencies,” Upthegrove said. 
“We’re heading into a very, very busy time,” said Kittias Valley Fire and Rescue Chief SJ Goldsmith, citing drought conditions and winds.
“It’s going to take just one spark to create a disaster for our community,” Goldsmith said. “Please make sure that we are taken care of and we don’t have to come put out a fire and risk our lives for your negligence.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fireworks-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

The community college announced this week its Senior Companion Program, an Americorps-funded initiative, has paused operation as its funding is being held and reviewed by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Hawkeye Community College Provost Lynn LaGrone said.
Americorps provides funds for programs working with volunteers ages 55 and older to help older adults with special needs live independently and comfortably through the Senior Companion Program. At Hawkeye Community College, LaGrone said the program operates with a $500,000 budget, $400,000 of which comes from Americorps.
College officials, program participants and clients are waiting and hoping the program is deemed valuable enough to the community to get the funding that was already approved by Congress.
“We are such an incredible part of this community that it hurts deeply to not be able to continue to offer a service that benefits some of our most vulnerable constituents,” LaGrone said.

Hawkeye Community College has offered the program since 1976, LaGrone said. Before the halt of operations, 52 senior companions helped 78 clients with what they needed most, whether it be transportation, cleaning or just camaraderie. With other federal grant uncertainty in higher education, she said the college was aware this could happen.
To ensure clients are aware of what’s going on and understand why their companions are no longer stopping by as usual, Executive Director of Public Relations and Marketing Mary Pat Moore said the program head is calling each client personally to “let them know that we’re not abandoning them” and provide advice and resources to try to fill the gap.
Vicky Buss, a second-generation companion who followed in her mother’s footsteps, said she gets paid $4 an hour to meet with three clients multiple times each week. What she does depends on the client’s wishes and needs, she said, but they are always overjoyed to see her stop by and sad to see her go.
“It’s not the money, per se, but it’s just that I feel like these people are people, human beings, and they need the companionship, they need the hugs, they need the caring, you know, and they don’t get that other (than) from us,” Buss said.

This is a program unlike most, LaGrone said, and addresses a growing concern of loneliness becoming a public health crisis. With many of the clients homebound and volunteers all being older adults, the program helps alleviate isolation alongside more practical problems.
“This, to me, adds to part of the crisis, because these were baby steps in the big pool of things, but they were so essential and important to the people who depended on this service,” LaGrone said.
The college has started exploring other funding options in case its federal dollars are permanently lost, but LaGrone said she is remaining “cautiously optimistic” that the funds will be released and the program can continue on like normal. As one of the college’s oldest programs, the community doesn’t want to let it slip away.
Some of the companions are still going out to visit their clients, on their own time and dime, LaGrone said, because of the deep connections and caring the program has facilitated. Buss said she plans to keep seeing at least one of her clients, who has cerebral palsy and always cries when she has to leave.
“I just don’t understand why the government ain’t working with us and helping us out to help them, because in the long run, we’re helping them out, keeping people in their homes,” Buss said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Back in February, South Dakota lawmakers recognized emergency medical services as an “essential service.”
Sort of.
“Essential service” typically means the government has to guarantee access to said service by providing or funding it.
The majority of states don’t affix that designation to ambulance services.
South Dakota lawmakers voted unanimously in favor of a non-binding resolution that says the Legislature “supports efforts to prioritize emergency medical service as an essential public service.”
Grant funds bolster rural ambulances with training, equipment

There were other efforts in Pierre that didn’t get quite so warm a reception.
Two days after the passage of that resolution, lawmakers shot down a bill that would’ve required counties and municipalities to provide ambulance services. Eight days after that, they shot down a similar bill that would’ve created a state fund to divert some money from criminal fines to help pay for services.
Instead of backing those bills, they chartered a committee to study the issue and stocked it with five senators and six representatives. 
On Monday, that group of lawmakers convened in Pierre to talk about long-term survival for the ambulance services now provided by a mix of paid and volunteer response teams across the state. 
The Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee heard testimony on low passage rates for emergency medical technician exams, a decline in volunteerism and the difficulty of setting up an ambulance district, a legal entity.
But one issue loomed over all others.
“The biggest thing I want to get across is that somebody has got to be responsible for funding us,” said Maynard Konechne, director of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association and a presenter during the Monday meeting.
The study group, which reconvenes on July 23, is tasked with producing a report for lawmakers on the sustainability of ambulance services in South Dakota, with a focus on three areas:

Staff recruitment, training and retention.
Access to care in rural areas far from trauma care centers.
Efficiencies in operations.

Citizens expect an ambulance to show up regardless of how far they live from the nearest hospital, said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, one of the committee’s two leaders. That means the group — and the Legislature as a whole — has to be ready to change the way it thinks about emergency medical services (EMS).
“We have to be willing to have a conversation about how we recognize, support and potentially restructure EMS as an essential part of our public safety system, just like law enforcement or fire services,” said Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, co-chair of the committee.
Rural areas, declining volunteers, low reimbursement rates
The average emergency medical technician in South Dakota is 51 years old, according to survey data collected by the state Department of Health. 
The department regulates and offers technical support to the state’s 121 licensed ambulance services. It also offers training, collects data, and, for the past three years, has been in the process of disbursing $20 million in COVID-era funding to modernize and bolster ambulance services across the state. 
New report recommends state efforts to sustain rural ambulance services

Marty Link, the director of the department’s Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Program, told the committee that South Dakota has 28 active emergency medical technicians (EMTs) between 70 and 75 years old — and two in their 80s.
“They’re doing great work, and I love them dearly,” said Link, himself a longtime service provider, but aging providers are part of the reason the state urged ambulance services to apply for grants to buy “power cots.” The cots lift and push patients into place without the aid of paramedic muscle, which allows older providers to stay on duty a few more years. 
The trouble is that fewer people are signing on to be volunteer technicians, Link said, and more stringent testing requirements have become a hurdle in recent years. 
Just 56% of the South Dakotans who took their paramedic test with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians passed on the first try this year. EMTs aren’t as highly trained as paramedics, but also must pass a test, often after completing a 190-hour certification course. The passage rate for South Dakota EMT hopefuls in 2025 thus far is 72%.
Paramedic and state Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, told the committee his first emergency medical course lasted eight hours. Increasing professionalization has meant a more skilled response team, he said, but it’s also put some people off.
Twenty-eight ambulance services in South Dakota are all volunteer. Another 24 have a mix of paid staff and volunteers, and still more are paid per-call.
Training can be ‘“four, five, six months of their life for something that they may not even be compensated for,” Emery said.
Jerome Harvey of Pennington County, a volunteer firefighter, told the committee he doesn’t see the volunteer model as workable long-term.
“The number one issue is steady state funding and realizing the fact that it is a profession,” he said. “We have to recognize that we’re on the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the pyramid, on the downhill slide in terms of volunteerism.”
Recruitment and retention were the number one needs identified in health department surveys of ambulance agencies, part of a 2023 sustainability assessment.
On Monday, Link and Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt trumpeted the department’s “Telemedicine in Motion” program, which has equipped 84% of South Dakota ambulance agencies with tablets that connect to doctors who can advise EMTs on how to best deal with traumatic issues.
Reimbursement troubles
Lemmon, in far northwestern South Dakota, is among the more rural of the state’s rural enclaves. Its nearest hospital is 26 miles away in Hettinger, North Dakota. 
State spends $11.6 million to update equipment for South Dakota ambulance services

Some of Lemmon’s ambulance services are delivered on a pay-per-call basis, but the call cost often outpaces the pay. Medicare covers about $650, Lemmon EMT Association Treasurer Carrie Derschan said, and Medicaid reimbursements pay around $400.
“That’s about 56%,” of the cost to run a patient from the Lemmon nursing home to the nearer hospital.
“We have to write the rest of that off,” she said.
A “Big, Beautiful Bill” packed with President Trump’s policy prescriptions is currently up for debate in Congress. The bill’s provisions have been revised multiple times so far, but Konechne, the EMS Association leader, said he worries that its proposed cuts to Medicaid will exacerbate the issues facing the mobile medical teams.
“We’re struggling the way it is,” said Konechne. “And now we’re going to take another hit. They’re not doing that for police and firefighters.”
Next steps
An increase to the base rate paid by Medicare and Medicaid in South Dakota for ambulance rides is among the funding options listed by the health department in its Monday presentation. Also suggested was funding help for training courses from the state, more investment from local communities for operational needs, and additional fees for “super speeders” or drunken drivers, earmarked to fund medical services.
Community buy-in is already part of the funding puzzle for rural ambulance services. 
Spearfish pitches in $50,000 a year, that city’s EMS director said. In Buffalo, a northwestern city near the Montana border, financial support for the Harding County service’s 2,500-square-mile coverage area comes from local businesses.
“They realize that we are health care,” said Annette Slaba, Harding County’s EMS director.

Emery sponsored one of the bills to require counties and cities to fund ambulance services that failed to earn support back in February. 
His included a plan to siphon some of the money the state collects in criminal fines into an EMS fund, from which localities could pull grants for their operations. It would have started with $1 million from the state general fund, but Emery said during debate on the measure that the fund would probably need $50 million a year to meet the state’s needs.
Committee member Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, said Monday that she feels like citizens wouldn’t balk at paying additional taxes for emergency medical services, as long as they understood where their money was going.
“We want quality people in those ambulances,” Grove said. “We want people who know what they’re doing and are willing to show up at our worst moments.”
Sen. Reed suggested that lawmakers could simplify the process of starting an ambulance district, around 20 of which exist today as multi-county, or multi-community partnerships. If state law makes it too difficult to set up those districts, Reed said, it might make sense to simplify the process to let communities take the lead.
“I don’t think we want the state starting to draw lines,” Reed said. “It’s best for communities to work together and figure this out. A taxing district would be a way of doing that.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/original_978949a6-1724-4a75-b829-cadf69a4b1da_PXL_20221118_164635230-scaled-e1668887227535-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Motorized cots and chairs, emergency medical technician training and life support dummies are among the purchases made by local ambulance services through two rounds of grant awards from the South Dakota Department of Health.
Some of those items came up during the first meeting of the Legislature’s Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee this week in Pierre. That body is studying ways to maintain the viability of the state’s ambulance services, which operate without state funding through a hodgepodge of paid, paid-per-call and volunteer frameworks.
The $7.5 million in grants for local agencies originated with federal COVID relief funding. Former Gov. Kristi Noem asked lawmakers to set aside $20 million of that money in 2022 to bolster local ambulance services.


The money came in three phases. The first $1.7 million was used to fund Telemedicine in Motion, which uses electronic tablets in ambulance vehicles to connect paramedics and other mobile medical providers to doctors who can help guide their responses. 
In the second phase, the state purchased and distributed LIFEPAK 15 patient monitors and defibrillators, along with training for their use, at a cost of $11.6 million.
The third step involved $7.5 million in grants to individual ambulance providers. Those were made available after the completion of a statewide assessment of sustainability for emergency medical services, paid for during the second funding phase. To apply, applicants were required to read the assessment and ask for items that could fill the gaps identified by the report. 
“We said, ‘If you want to apply for a grant, you have to be able to read the study, to read what was done statewide,” Marty Link, the Health Department’s director of emergency medical services, told the committee on Monday. “We didn’t want that just sitting on the shelf.”
Equipment, training purchased through grant awards
Among other things, the sustainability report cited recruitment and retention, an aging volunteer base and funding for equipment as major needs. 
To that end, dozens of local agencies applied for grants to purchase motorized “power cots” and stair chairs, which allow medics to transfer patients without the physical strain.
Fifteen of the 44 grants in round one, awarded in July 2024, included one or more power cots and chairs, distributed across 14 communities. Some of those grants also included money for instructor training, training classes, medical simulation mannequins and software.
Lawmakers look for ways to deliver on support for ‘essential’ ambulance service

Another 18 of the round two grants awarded last November involved the purchase of mobile people-movers.
“With an aging workforce and patients who are getting larger and larger, it helps us get people safely in and out of the house,” said Alan Perry, who heads up the ambulance service in Lennox and is the president of the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association.
Perry’s agency bought one power cot and one stair chair with a $45,000 grant, awarded last July. The agency got another $25,200 in the second round to produce a strategic planning report for Lennox, and to buy bright, wearable lights for use by those who respond to incidents on highways at night.
Training was also a focus area. In Spink County, the ambulance service was able to hire two emergency medical technicians and put on a training course for other technician hopefuls. Twelve of the 17 people who qualified to take the national exam passed and were certified, according to the Department of Health’s presentation to lawmakers on Monday.
Grant money for patient transfer database
The largest single grant went to the South Dakota Association of Health Care Organizations for a project that aims to boost efficiencies statewide. 
The group is using its $500,000 grant to set up an interfacility transfer system that it hopes will create “a single portal where neighboring ambulance services can view and select available transfers” by November 2026.
Link pointed to that project during the study committee’s first meeting. 
Ambulances that move patients without emergency needs from one facility to another – like a patient who needs to ride from a nursing home in Chamberlain to an orthopedic hospital in Sioux Falls – can create hazards for their own communities by doing so, he said.
“There’s a lot of concern with ‘How do we maintain that ambulance presence within our local community when we have an ambulance going over the road?” Link said.

As a result, local ambulance services may decline to give the ride or ask that the patient wait for a ride, according to Tim Rave, director of the association. On any given day, Rave told South Dakota Searchlight, there are up to 80 people in the state who are in a hospital that ought to be somewhere else.
That’s the kind of information the association’s collected with its grant funding, Rave said, as it looks to find out how prevalent the issue is. The database the association aims to build would make it easier to alert ambulance services in any given area to patients in need of a ride, Rave said.
In the future, he said, such a database could help ambulances do things like pick up patients from the hospital to which they’ve just delivered a different patient and bring them home.
That would allow a service to “get paid both ways.”
“That’s the sweet spot we’d love to get to, but that feels a little bit like a stretch goal at this point,” Rave said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PXL_20221118_164408441-scaled-e1668887078839-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

Keith Kautz left the high court last year due to the state’s mandatory retirement age. He takes over as Wyoming’s top legal official as state attorneys defend a string of anti-abortion laws in court.
The post Gordon names former Wyoming Supreme Court justice who spoke out against abortion as new attorney general appeared first on WyoFile .","Keith Kautz, a retired Wyoming Supreme Court justice known to carry deep religious convictions against abortions, will become the state’s next attorney general, Gov. Mark Gordon announced Tuesday.
Kautz stepped down from the bench last March, when he turned 70 years old — the legally mandated retirement age for justices in Wyoming’s high court. He is, in essence, swapping positions with Bridget Hill, who served as Wyoming AG until Gordon appointed her in April to fill the supreme court seat left open by the retirement of former Chief Justice Kate Fox earlier this year. 
Fox and Kautz were admirers of each other’s passion for the rule of law, though they often disagreed on judicial decisions, WyoFile reported in a November 2023 piece on Kautz’s retirement. 
Kautz grew up around Huntley, Wyoming, and Lyman, Nebraska, and has a University of Wyoming law degree. Gov. Mike Sullivan first appointed him to the bench in 1993, and Gov. Matt Mead appointed him to the high court in 2015. 
Kautz will become the state’s top law enforcement officer, and its chief litigator, at a time when women’s right to seek an abortion is one of the most pressing issues facing the Wyoming judiciary. Wyomingites have been waiting on the state supreme court to rule on the constitutionality of two bans on abortions passed by the Legislature in 2023. If the justices strike down the total ban, a number of court cases on other abortion restrictions — such as an ultrasound requirement, prohibitions on off-label abortion prescriptions and strict regulations on the state’s lone abortion clinic — will all likely have to be litigated. Kautz would presumably helm the state’s defense of the Legislature’s policies in those cases.
As the state’s top law enforcement officer, Kautz could also play a role in determining how zealously Wyoming enforces whichever restrictions on abortion do survive legal muster.
The former justice made his personal opinions on the matter clear in April, days before his old colleagues held a hearing on the abortion ban. Alongside conservative religious leaders and leaders of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, Kautz participated in a “pray in” ahead of that hearing, leading prayers that the justices would uphold the ban.
“To our great shame, Father, we have decided that an unborn child made in your image isn’t a child at all, but merely an unidentified tissue of potential life that may be destroyed and killed even though we know it is alive,” Kautz said during his prayer remarks. “We are becoming enslaved to unthinkable corruption and immorality and we deserve the consequences of our actions.”
His participation in that event raised eyebrows among some pro-choice advocates. When questioned about it by Wyoming Public Media, Kautz said he had asked Fox not to assign him any cases in his retirement — retired judges in Wyoming will sometimes be called upon to hear a case due to judicial workload or judges having conflicts of interest.
“Because of my interest in this particular issue, abortion, and the right to life and the sanctity of life, I thought it would be better for me and the judiciary for me not to be assigned any cases,” Kautz told WPR.

It’s unlikely a Wyoming attorney general would recuse themselves from defending or enforcing a state law because they personally believed in it, legal observers said. While state officials are governed by conflict-of-interest rules, those apply to financial conflicts or matters involving family members. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Gordon, said he wasn’t able to comment on the question. WyoFile was unable to reach Kautz on Wednesday, when his appointment was announced. 
In a news release announcing his appointment, Gordon praised Kautz’s long tenure in the Wyoming judiciary. When the two men met to discuss the appointment, Kautz quoted George Washington, who said that “due administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good Government,” according to the news release. 
In his 2023 interview with WyoFile, Kautz lamented the divisive rhetoric and polarization in today’s politics.
“It’s unfortunate,” he said. “I don’t think that’s productive. But I’m not willing, in a democracy, to say ‘You can’t have the rhetoric.’”
Gordon’s appointment may be well received by his critics on the right. It comes at a time when some legislators have called for changing Wyoming law to make the attorney general an elected position, as opposed to an appointed one. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to make that change with a 6-3 vote. Chamber leadership chose not to consider the measure on the floor, however, killing the bill.

This week marks the 25th anniversary of civil unions, which were the most sweeping grant of rights to gay couples in the nation when they became law on July 1, 2000.
Civil unions grew out of a lawsuit filed by three gay and lesbian couples who had been denied marriage licenses in Vermont. The lawsuit was known as Baker v. Vermont. In December 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same benefits of marriage as heterosexual couples. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to craft a law that would satisfy the ruling, either by legalizing same-sex marriage or by creating an equivalent partnership structure. 
Vermont Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy wrote that the decision, “is simply a recognition of our common humanity.” 
It would take until 2009 for Vermont to legalize same-sex marriage. 
To mark the milestone, I spoke with four of the key participants behind civil unions. Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck were two of the six plaintiffs in Baker v. Vermont. Chief Justice Amestoy wrote the decision. Gov. Howard Dean signed civil unions into law. (Rep. Bill Lippert recounted how the Vermont legislature passed the historic law on The Vermont Conversation in an interview in April.)

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. The unabridged audio version of this interview can be heard by clicking the audio bar above.
THE PLAINTIFFS
I first met Stacy Jolles and Nina Beck in their South Burlington home in 2000 when I covered the civil unions debate for Mother Jones. In my article, I described them cooing over their newborn son. Seth Jolles has since graduated from college and graduate school. Nina and Stacy had a civil union and were married as each of those opportunities became legal.
Stacy, now 67, a psychologist, and Nina, 69, a physical therapist, are now “semi-retired.” They have been familiar faces as the owners of the popular Burlington tea house, Dobra Tea, which they owned for 11 years and sold in 2021. 
Stacy and Nina joined me on the Vermont Conversation in 2015 to talk about the US Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationally, known as the Obergefell decision. 
This week, I asked them how it felt to be marking the 25th anniversary of civil unions.
Stacy Jolles   
I can’t believe it’s been 25 years. That seemed like such a time of great hope and such a different time than it feels right now. So it is nice to go back and remember that times were better but it’s a little scary to realize that we made it 25 years. We may not make it 26.
Nina Beck
It’s an odd juxtaposition to be celebrating something that happened what feels like a very long time ago but really is only the lifetime of our son, and yet wondering what the future holds or if we’re going to lose those rights that we gained.
David Goodman 
You were one of the three couples that were part of this landmark lawsuit. Tell us a little of your personal story as a couple and then what brought you to sue the state of Vermont?
Stacy Jolles   
Stacy prior to our son Seth, who’s 25 now, we had a son, Noah. We were living in North Carolina and we knew at the time that in order to protect me as the non-biological parent, we needed to do a lot of legal paperwork. And so we did that. When Nina was giving birth, we tried to have a home birth but we ended up going to the hospital. And there was another pregnant couple, actually, that went in, and they didn’t ask the gentleman of the couple anything about paperwork, and they literally stopped me at the door and asked for my paperwork and what allowed me to be there. Who was I? Nina was struggling to give birth and Noah was in trouble in utero and I had to come up with the paperwork that allowed me to be there. So for me, that was a very pivotal moment in our lives and it laid the groundwork that marriage is really a legal contract primarily to protect the children. I don’t need the state to sanction my relationship. I don’t need any public validation other than I need legal protection for my kids. So when the opportunity came along, that was what was in my mind.
Nina Beck   
Stacy and I were living in California before we moved to North Carolina and Vermont. In 1992, we had our big Jewish wedding, which was for our friends and family. That was of course not legally meaningful at all. At the time, we’d heard about a lawsuit brought by three couples in Hawaii and they tried to get marriage. They were the first state, and they failed. But that totally put the idea in my mind that this was a fight. This was this was maybe possible. 
We decided together that if we live somewhere where it was possible to be involved in the work for legal civil marriage, that we wanted to do it. That was 1992, and we showed up in Vermont in 1996 in April and found the Vermont Freedom to Marry movement. We said, how can we be involved? We want to do this. 
David Goodman   
Talk about the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force and the marriage equality movement in Vermont that you were part of.
Stacy Jolles   
Well, the movement was really Beth and Susan. 
David Goodman   
This was Beth Robinson, now a federal judge, and Susan Murray, your attorneys at the time.
Stacy Jolles   
Exactly. A lot can be done with just two people who are dedicated. And they were absolutely phenomenal. 
Nina Beck   
It was a very grassroots movement in terms of trying to lift people’s awareness of what is civil marriage (and) why would we want it? Many people traveled all over the state to speak at events to try and gain public support for this. 
David Goodman   
What kind of responses did you get when you were out there tabling and at county fairs?
Stacy Jolles   
Surprisingly we got mostly positive feedback. Both Nina and I were activists our whole lives and we had nothing to lose. It was our obligation since we were both lucky: our families weren’t going to disown us. We weren’t going to lose our jobs. We had so many privileges in so many ways that so many gay and lesbian people didn’t have then and still don’t have. It felt like an obligation to be the person that came forward when so many others couldn’t.
We experienced very little backlash. We got only one letter that was from someone who said they were going to pray for us. And I’m always happy to have somebody pray for me (laughs). 
David Goodman   
I remember being in the Vermont State House when civil unions was being debated in the winter in early 2000. It was intense. There were busloads of people, many from out of state and many with very noticeable southern accents who were from evangelical churches in the South. It felt very volatile. How did it feel to you?
Stacy Jolles   
Well, we’re both martial artists. Not that we were going to get into any kind of physical altercation. 
It was a different time. If I was in that situation now, I would feel very differently. Political violence has become much more normalized. It was moving times, emotional times, but I didn’t feel in danger.
Nina Beck   
I feel like there was a difference between the way Vermont people who lived here reacted to us, even when they didn’t agree with us, as opposed to the people who came up from the south and came from other states. Those people were much more threatening. And also the Vermont folks, even those who were not on our side, didn’t want help. They told those people basically go away. We’re going to keep it local. 
Later when we’d drive through the countryside and see the barns printed with Take Back Vermont, it wasn’t warm and welcoming, but I honestly didn’t feel in danger. 
David Goodman   
The Baker decision was a win for advancing LGBTQ rights, but Stacy, you’ve told me that you felt it was a loss. Explain how it could be both.
Stacy Jolles   
When the decision came down and the (Vermont) Supreme Court basically punted (same-sex partnership) to the legislature, I felt like we lost. The Supreme Court did not rule for marriage. Intellectually, I recognize that you take two steps forward, one step back. I get that it was progress, but I felt like we lost. I felt like the Supreme Court said, No, we’re not going to give you marriage. (Civil unions) wasn’t going to protect my kids in the way I needed them protected. At the time I was working full time and staying home with Seth, and it wasn’t going to protect his rights with the over 2000 federal advantages from marriage. 
Nina Beck  
We live on Lake Champlain, and if we traveled across that lake to New York State, our civil union wouldn’t necessarily be recognized there. What if we went across the lake for the day and got in trouble and needed medical care? There were many, many important protections that marriage has, that civil unions left out. It was separate but unequal.
David Goodman   
It took another decade for Vermont to pass same-sex marriage in 2009 over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. How did that feel?
Stacy Jolles   
That was awesome. That felt like a step in the right direction towards federal marriage being legal in all states. That was uplifting. 
David Goodman   
Did you get a civil union and then get married? 
Nina Beck   
Yes, we had a civil union ceremony, which included our local representative coming to our house, acting as Justice of the Peace, sitting in our living room and signing a piece of paper. We were not very excited about it, but we wanted it legally in place. When we won marriage, we had a great party in the boathouse at the Burlington waterfront. We recreated our big Jewish wedding, and Beth (Robinson) officiated. That was a great party. 
David Goodman   
Twenty-five years after civil unions in Vermont, there is intense blowback against LGBTQ rights. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled against LGBTQ rights in several cases, allowing parents to opt-out their children from school classes that include LGBTQ-themed books, and banning gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. How fearful are you that the rights that you won could be undone?
Stacy Jolles   
I think they will be undone. 
I am the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, as is Nina. So we were raised to view governments like the one we’re experiencing now in a very different way than most Americans might view it. I think it’s going to get very bad and I’m just going to be active until the very last minute. I can be active trying to protect young LGBTQ people’s rights, particularly young transgender people. And I think we’re going to have to fight harder than we have before. 
Nina Beck   
Not to make too many parallels, but the Jews of Europe became extremely assimilated, particularly Austria and Germany, and kind of forgot that antisemitism was real. And there’s a way in which I think young people today who have grown up in the last 25 years without knowledge of homophobia in the way that we who grew up in the 60s and 70s felt it. So it’s a shock to them. It’s not surprising to me, but it is scary in a way that we haven’t seen in a long time.
Every day some more rights are lost. I don’t want to go back to living that way, but I know how to and we’ll just keep fighting. We’ll just have to keep fighting and not be shocked and horrified that these things are going away but rather activated by it.
David Goodman   
You both lived through a time when it seemed impossible that same-sex marriage could win. In 1996, President Clinton passed the Defense of Marriage Act. The tide was not in your favor in the late 1990s. What is your advice to the next generation of activists about what’s needed to prevail even at a time like this?
Stacy Jolles   
We have to be vigilant and brave and as out there as we possibly can. It’s going to get really bad, it’s going to get really scary, and we still are going to have to stand up and fight.
Nina Beck
Don’t back down. 
We have to be as strong as humanly possible. We can look to AIDS activists for tactics. We can look to the civil rights workers for tactics. There’s so many organizations that have gone before us. We just have to adopt the tactics of our predecessors and do it again.
David Goodman   
Any last thoughts? 
Nina Beck   
We continue to feel very privileged to live in the great state of Vermont where we do have rights and privileges as gay and lesbian people. Vermont is the only state that has no laws pending or on the books against trans people. That’s remarkable. We are very lucky to be here.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
Jeffrey Amestoy served as attorney general of Vermont from 1985 to 1997, winning seven elections, five of them as the nominee of both the Republican and Democratic parties. In 1997, Governor Howard Dean appointed Amestoy to be Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Two years later, he wrote the Baker decision. Amestoy retired as chief justice in 2004 and later was a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
Amestoy, 78, spoke with me at his home in Waterbury Center with a stunning view of Mount Mansfield. I asked him what led him to write the most famous line from the Baker decision, that legalizing same-sex partnerships was “simply a recognition of our common humanity.”
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was cognizant of the extent to which a pure legal analysis that dictated a result to the people of Vermont on an issue that divided them was something to be concerned about. I thought if we could frame the issue in terms that folks would respond to, they would begin to see what it meant in terms of the rights involved. So the phrase “common humanity” was one that I had hoped would resonate. I think it helped structure the public debate, because it became not a question of whether a special class should get special treatment, but I think it helped promote a dialog in which people spoke of their own personal experiences and related it to common humanity. 
The structure of the legal analysis was based on the common benefits clause. So it became a mechanism to try to encourage a public dialog that spoke to the heart of the matter, which was really human relationships. 
David Goodman   
How aware were you that your decision would have national implications and thrust Vermont into the middle of a national culture war?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I was aware of the significance of the issue to a substantial portion of the country. Folks had fought long and hard, like Beth Robinson and Susan Murray and other advocates for same-sex recognition. You couldn’t be ignorant of the extent to which it had been turned into a real divisive political issue. The Defense of Marriage Act was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996 — that’s three years before our opinion. The (U.S.) Senate passed (DOMA), 85 to 14. Senator Leahy and Senator Jeffords both voted for it. That law said that marriage was between a man and a woman, and beyond that, no state was required to recognize another state’s same-sex marriage. That framed the political culture. It was a reminder to me that any decision that Vermont came up with was going to precipitate a national debate.
David Goodman   
You also knew that other state courts had waded into this terrain. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 1993 and Anchorage (Alaska) Superior Court in 1998 had both legalized same-sex marriage, only to have voters in those states pass constitutional amendments that reversed the decision. How did that affect you as you approached the Baker decision, knowing that you could spark a backlash that could result in this being a very short lived decision?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It was fundamental to my perception of how we ought to weigh the consequences of the decision if our rationale was trying to advance equal rights for same-sex couples. To me, one of the paramount determinations to be made was how likely was a decision of the court going to advance that? Would a same-sex marriage decision directed from the court advance that? Based on the experiences of Alaska and Hawaii, (legalizing same-sex marriage) would have certainly precipitated a constitutional amendment in Vermont that would have found a lot of public support that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman. That would have cut off the ability for a court to deal with the matter if the Vermont State Constitution was amended. 
In terms of the climate of the time, between the decision of our court in December 1999 and the civil unions passage in April 2000, voters in California, a liberal state, passed (Proposition 22), a referendum that defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. That passed 61 to 39 percent. That was an indicator of the extent to which there wasn’t going to be a straight line from a Supreme Court decision, even from Vermont, that was going to then lead directly to the recognition of same-sex marriage legally in this country. So all those were part of my framing of the issue.
David Goodman   
You’re describing a very hostile national climate regarding same-sex marriage. What persuaded you to go a different way?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
We tried to look at the issue of the claim for same-sex marriage rights in the context of the Vermont constitution. You had a culture and a history of Vermont in terms of the creation of the common benefits clause. What persuaded me was a legal analysis that we could draw from Vermont’s constitutional culture and one I think that was consistent with Vermont values. So from that standpoint, beyond whatever our personal consideration about the issue was, the claim for same-sex marriage benefits in Vermont resonated with our constitutional framework. Our decision attempted to advance that in a way that would lead to what it did lead to, which was eventually an embrace of same-sex marriage by Vermonters.
David Goodman   
The Baker decision legalized either marriage or an equivalent partnership structure. It took another 10 years before marriage passed over the veto of Governor Jim Douglas. Why didn’t you just legalize same-sex marriage in 1999?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
I thought it would precipitate a constitutional amendment in Vermont, as was being done in 36 other states and was being done in California, that would compel states through their own state constitutions that would foreclose courts from deciding the issue. The constitutional amendments in each state would have provisions that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. 
The response even to the civil union decision indicated how difficult it would have been in that climate in that time to have even Vermonters abide by that decision in the Supreme Court. If you look at the surveys at the time, Vermonters were not embracing the idea of same-sex marriage, and they were not embracing the idea of civil unions either. So it became a much more difficult task for the legislature. Not that what we’d done was an easy thing to do, but the difficult and hard work (that) we honor 25 years later was the work of the Vermont legislature and, of course, Vermonters themselves.
David Goodman   
What does this 25 year milestone mean to you?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It makes me proud of Vermont. I’m from Vermont. It was a testament to my own faith in the judgment of Vermonters. What Vermonters should be proud of is that it advanced the extraordinary significance of same-sex marriage in this country in a way that I think would have taken longer and perhaps had a more difficult route. Vermonters, as I’d hoped they would, rose to the occasion, as they’ve done historically in a number of other areas too. 
David Goodman   
What did you feel when the U.S. Supreme Court passed the Obergefell decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015?
Jeffrey Amestoy   
It came much sooner than I thought. At the time of Baker, if someone had asked me would the U.S. Supreme Court reach a decision legalizing same-sex marriage in my lifetime, I would have said no. I go again to the point of how a constructive, realistic approach to moving public discourse that recognizes common humanity probably moved that to a much quicker decision by the United States Supreme Court than I would have thought possible. That was a testament to what we had done in Vermont.
THE GOVERNOR
Howard Dean, 76, became governor in 1991 on the death in office of Governor Richard Snelling. Dean was subsequently elected to five two-year terms, becoming the longest serving governor in Vermont history. 
David Goodman   
How did you feel about same-sex marriage in the mid to late 1990s? Democrats nationally were not particularly supportive.
Gov. Howard Dean   
President Clinton wasn’t supportive because he was a great politician and could read the polls. I was not a great champion at the time. I remember exactly where I was when the (Baker) court decision came down. I was in Burlington at a meeting on education, and somebody threw a microphone in front of my face and said, What do you think of this? And my response was a great dismay to people who later became very close friends (like Rep.) Bill Lippert. 
I said, “Well, it makes me uncomfortable, same as everybody else.” And I was uncomfortable.  
I grew up in the 60s and when I was in high school, it was unthinkable to say who you were if you were gay. There was plenty of homophobia. I grew up in a different era. I came to change my mind as governor, because it was actually quite simple. The same-sex marriage people basically outlined about 1700 rights that you could have if you were a married heterosexual person that you could not have if you were in a gay partnership. And as soon as that happened, I realized this was a civil rights bill. It wasn’t just about marriage, (it was) about equality under the law. There was a whole population of Americans that was discriminated against and so something had to be done about it. But I was somebody who had to be brought along because of my upbringing and because of the generation I come from.
David Goodman   
It’s helpful for people to understand where things were in the 1990s. Even for a Democratic governor like yourself, this was not a simple issue. 
Gov. Howard Dean   
Yeah, it was complicated. But once it got distilled to the civil rights issue, that was easy. And then (Reps.) Tom Little and Bill Lippert, who were respectively the chairman and vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House, came to me and said, Look, we can’t get marriage out of our committee, so we’re going to call it civil unions. And essentially, they said a civil union is going to be marriage by another name. And so I said, Look, you guys are the ones on the firing line. You have to do it. And of course, Bill (Lippert), because he was gay, if he was advising this course, then that was sort of the gold standard. And then it went to the Senate. It passed. And that was brutal. In the House, absolutely brutal. 
The (House speech) I remember the most was (Rep.) John Edwards, who was this former state trooper from a very conservative part of the state, which is Franklin County. And he gave up his seat. There was (Rep.) Marion Milne. She gave up her seat. She got up and said she was from Barre and didn’t like this. And she said basically, this is the right thing to do. She didn’t flinch. 
David Goodman   
Unlike anyone else involved in this issue, you had to run statewide after passing civil unions in 2000. This was the heyday of the Take Back Vermont movement, which really sprung up in response to civil unions being passed. You won re-election in 2000 with 50.5% of the vote, barely enough to keep it out of the legislature…
Gov. Howard Dean   
…Which was a Republican legislature after all was said and done because of civil unions. 
David Goodman   
Many legislators who supported civil unions were defeated in November 2000. So there was a political price to pay. What impact did you think civil unions would have on your political future? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I hate to say this, and nobody’s going to believe it, but I didn’t care. 
This is where the problem with most politicians is. If an issue like this comes along and you conclude that it’s a matter of civil rights, and you duck it for the convenience of your election, you’re wasting your time in politics. Which, of course, is what the problem in Congress is today. I’d say 100% of the Republicans and a good portion of the Democrats are wasting their time because they shouldn’t be in politics. If you’re not willing to stand up for something, why are you in the business? And so for me, it was easy. 
David Goodman   
You signed civil unions into law in 2000 and it took nine years, and over the veto of your successor, Governor Douglas, for same-sex marriage to be legalized in Vermont. Do you have any second thoughts that perhaps just legalizing gay marriage in 2000 would have been the better move?
Gov. Howard Dean   
We couldn’t possibly get it through the legislature. If Bill Lippert comes to me and says, I can’t get this through the legislature, and Tom Little – (a Republican) who in all states other than this one would be a Democrat — if those two people come to me and say they can’t get the bill through…
In politics, sometimes you have to take half and come back and get the other half later. What we did was the first marriage equivalent bill in the entire United States of America. And I think if we hadn’t done what we did, that would have set the cause back for years. We were the model. Even though it wasn’t full marriage — but it basically was as the two described it in the privacy of my office, this is marriage in everything but name — and that’s what it was.
David Goodman   
What do you think was the national significance of Vermont’s civil unions bill?
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think people saw it as gay marriage. It was sort of the lead issue. It happened. I think the next state that did it was Massachusetts, and they did it by court order.
David Goodman   
Today we see a backlash against LGBTQ issues, with the US Supreme Court and Congress limiting rights. Do you think this is a backlash that began right after you signed that law?
Gov. Howard Dean   
This is an organized conservative attempt to overthrow rights which the vast majority of American people support. This (U.S. Supreme) Court essentially is bought and paid for. The court system in this country is a disaster and thank God it wasn’t like that when all this stuff was going on. 
David Goodman   
In the long arc of your political career, where do you rank civil unions among the things that you’ve accomplished? 
Gov. Howard Dean   
I think the only thing that was more important was getting the waiver from the Clinton administration to insure all kids under 300% of poverty. Virtually every child in the state has health insurance, and that’s been going on since 1992. So that one I’d have to put first, but I’d put civil unions second. 
In terms of personal challenges, civil unions was by far the first, because I didn’t really for sure understand what it was to be a public servant until you have to make a decision like that, where you know the public is going to be really upset. I didn’t know I had it in me to do what was right instead of what was politically expedient. 
I never regretted. I had to wear a bulletproof vest all summer during my campaign because the threats were so awful, not just in state, mostly out of state, and all the parades I had to go to, and the meetings that I went to, and tremendous amount of money spent by the Vermont taxpayers on making sure that nobody could take a shot at me. But it never crossed my mind.
Why are you in politics if you don’t stand up for anything that needs to be stood up for?

""When Aiden Became a Brother"" can be seen in the front. Pierce County LibraryA Pierce County librarian is out of a job because of what she calls political pressure over a book about a transgender child that was part of a display in the library.
Former Pierce County Library Manager Lavonnia Moore doesn’t have a degree in library science but worked her way to the top over 15 years, starting as a part-time clerk.
That came to an end on June 18 when she says she was called into the office to speak with Three Rivers Library System Director Jeremy Snell, who told her she was being let go over a book that was part of a summer reading display. Moore said the book, titled “When Aidan Became a Brother” by Kyle Lukoff, was selected for the display by a child at the library.
Moore said she did not have a history of disciplinary problems or bad performance reviews.
Snell did not respond to a voicemail or emailed requests for comment. Snell told the Blackshear Times that the display of the book was the reason for the decision.
Moore said she has hired an attorney.
“It was a shock. I was shocked. I said ‘OK.’ And I broke down. In my mind, I was thinking to myself, ‘I was not going to tell a child no,’” she said.
Moore said the beginning of the end came near the start of June when she allowed parents and kids to create a display to match the theme of the Georgia Public Library Service’s summer reading program, “color our world.”
“There were books, DVDs, games, and each and every one of them had at least a hint of a rainbow on it,” she said. “Because all the kids went to find rainbows. I was just happy that the kids knew where the books were. They even took the time to go into the card catalog to find books. I’m like, ‘Oh! They used the library properly! They know how to use the library!”
“One kid put a box of crayons on the display,” she added. “I’m like ‘Dude, that’s awesome,’ and he’s like ‘I know, right?”
Moore said one of the children brought the book “When Aidan Became a Brother.” Moore said she didn’t know it at the time, but the book is about a young transgender boy whose family is expecting a new baby.

The book is written for young children and discusses Aidan’s gender identity not matching his sex at birth. It doesn’t contain anything graphic or explicit. The cover shows Aidan with his family wearing a shirt with a rainbow on it.
“All I saw was Aidan becoming a big brother,” Moore said. “I saw a family with a kid wearing a rainbow sweater and the mom pregnant. It was a mixed family. I was like, ‘OK, sure, put it on the table.’”
But the book’s placement didn’t sit well with a group called Alliance for Faith and Freedom, which made posts on social media calling on followers to write in to library staff and Pierce County commissioners.
“Please PRAY and take just a few minutes right now to email the (Three Rivers Regional Library) staff and Pierce Commissioners to encourage them to put a stop to this and show them the community supports them in taking a stand against promoting transgenderism at our local library,” the group wrote in posts on Facebook and Instagram.
The group’s Instagram post had no visible likes, comments or shares, while the Facebook post had 26 reactions, ten comments and 82 shares.
Alliance for Faith and Freedom did not respond to a request for comment.
Moore said she had no intention to promote any ideology but kept books relevant to all kinds of people in the community, including LGBTQ people, immigrants from different countries and people who speak various languages.
“The library is for everybody,” she said. “You should be able to go into any library and feel welcome or at least find something that you will enjoy reading, doing, or any resources. I know this day in time is tough, believe me, it is real tough, but the library should be one place that should not be a hurdle.”
Moore said the group has targeted her before over similar issues.
According to the Blackshear Times, the Pierce County Library left the Okefenokee Regional Library System last year, joining the Three Rivers System last July “over controversies surrounding certain sexual displays and bathroom policies.”
‘The fundamental mission of every library’
Organizations like Alliance for Faith and Freedom target libraries across the country, said Todd Cates, a library media specialist in Georgia and the recent winner of the Georgia Library Media Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award.
“They seem to be interested in removing books only that discuss LGBTQ issues or issues of people of color,” he said. “They latch onto a book based on the cover, based on the title, based on the topic. They generally don’t have any real reason to attack the book other than it talks about people of color or LGBTQ topics. They raise a stink, and politicians respond to stink.”
Cates said libraries have procedures for patrons to challenge books and he was disappointed to hear that Moore was fired.
He said “When Aidan Became a Brother” was appropriate for the library’s shelves and the display.
“That’s the fundamental mission of every library. We represent all members of our community, no matter their race, their creed, their religion, their gender, their sexual identity, their sexuality, where they’re from. My library here at my school, I have books in Spanish, I have books in Korean. I represent everybody. I have several copies of the Bible on my shelf. There’s several copies of books that would probably be considered controversial by other groups of people, but that’s immaterial because it represents the people that I serve.”
Georgia mom Lena Kotler said she’s happy when her 10-year-old transgender child Aleix can see herself reflected in the books she reads or the shows she watches.
“I want my child to see people like her, but see them living joyfully and with an in-depth life,” the Decatur mom said. “I’m a millennial. The rare times we saw anything mentioned about someone being trans or in some way gender nonconforming, it was a punchline, it was a plot twist, it was this negative thing, and I want my children to see people like them growing up to be adults who are happy and joyful and have the full life experience, the spectrum of life experience.”
But while inclusion is important, the writing still has to be good, Aleix says, and sometimes transgender characters are written as one-dimensional with their whole plot revolving around being trans.
Aleix’ recommendations for kids’ media that get LGBTQ representation right include the 2022 Disney film “Strange World” and “DeadEndia,” a webcomic and graphic novel with an animated adaptation.

(Courtesy of Lake County School District)Colorado school districts are scrambling after the Trump administration put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools across the country, including an estimated $70 million earmarked for the state. 
The U.S. Department of Education is withholding certain grants for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States were notified Monday, a day before they would typically receive the money. 
This pause has left districts across Colorado uncertain about programs they were already committed to offering. Colorado Education Commissioner Susana Córdova sent a letter to schools about the withheld grants, saying she is “deeply concerned about the potential impact of the delay and ongoing uncertainty surrounding these critical funds.”
The federal Department of Education has not provided a timeline on the funds, which it said are under review in a notice to states. The funds were already approved by Congress.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the notice said.
Gov. Jared Polis called the move a “direct attack on children, families and Colorado educators” in a statement Wednesday.
“This funding for our schools is already obligated, and it’s absurd that the federal government withheld it,” Polis said. “Investing in education and ensuring that Colorado children have the best possible future has been a top priority, and it’s disappointing to see the federal government hurt students and teachers.”
Programs in limbo
The paused grants make up two-thirds of the after-school program budget for the Lake County School District, which is nestled in the mountains of central Colorado at a 10,000-foot elevation. 
Half of the students enrolled in the small district qualify for subsidized school lunches, and most of their parents drive hours to get to their jobs in high-end resort towns. These parental commutes are why the district’s after-school programs — which provide kids with tutoring, healthy snacks and even occasional bagpipe lessons — are “essential child care,” Superintendent Kate Bartlett said. 
Without the federal grants totaling about $400,000 the district expected to receive, Bartlett said most or all of the after-school programming would shut down, forcing some parents to cut hours at work.
“It’s not just losing out on Lego robotics,” Bartlett said. “The downstream impact is actually much deeper. So that is what makes me sad and worried, not just about outcomes for kids, but really outcomes for families and outcomes for our regional economy.”
The Trump administration’s decision has hit other districts across the state hard as well. Denver Public Schools stands to lose at least $10 million if the grants aren’t disbursed, according to district spokesperson Scott Pribble. That could push the district, which is the largest in the state, to make cuts to staffing, programs and services, he said.
Alex Marrero, superintendent of Denver Public Schools, and Carrie Olson, president of the district’s Board of Education, issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon to “demand the immediate release of these funds.”
“This action is not just a logistical crisis — it is a moral and constitutional breach,” the statement said. “The decision to delay the distribution of congressionally-appropriated education funds is a dangerous overreach of executive authority and a direct affront to public education, especially for communities that rely most heavily on these supports.”
Colorado Education Association President Kevin Vick said in a Wednesday interview that the teachers union is seeking “every available avenue” to get the funding restored.
“Most of this funding is earmarked for our most vulnerable students in our most vulnerable districts, and so as these districts are making plans for the upcoming school year, they were relying on these funds to be able to put needed programs in place,” Vick said. “These funds need to be delivered to Colorado as promised.”
School-based mental health care
In a decision earlier this year, the Trump administration canceled about $1 billion in Department of Education grants that focus on addressing student mental health. Those grants come from a different pot of money than the funding paused this week.
On Tuesday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser announced that he was joining 15 other state attorneys general in a lawsuit to restore the mental health grants, calling their cancellation illegal and vague. Nearly $10 million is at stake for Colorado institutions, including the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado, University of Denver and Colorado Department of Education. 
The funding was meant to “address a shortage of school-based mental health care professionals through recruitment, retraining and re-specializing clinical workers for school-based roles,” according to a statement from Weiser. 
“This illegal action by the U.S. Department of Education to rip away critical funding couldn’t be happening at a worse time,” Weiser said.  “Colorado is taking action because our educational leaders need every tool possible to support kids who are struggling with disconnectedness, loneliness and isolation.”
The lawsuit was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LCIS-Students-Initiative-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 19:08:06.281567

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)Hundreds of immigrants awaiting deportation will arrive Wednesday night at the detention center the state built in the Everglades, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced on X.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told reporters Wednesday morning that the timing for arrival of detainees depended on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The operations at the Everglades Center that Uthmeier and Gov. Ron DeSantis have referred to as a “one-stop shop” for deportations are starting a day after President Donald Trump visited and urged other states to build similar sites.
Uthmeier didn’t offer specifics of the number of people set to arrive at the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport or where they are coming from. DHS and Uthmeier’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions from Florida Phoenix.
“Alligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,” Uthmeier wrote, using Florida officials’ name for the site. “Next stop: back to where they came from.”
Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

During his Tuesday visit, Trump said the center would house “some of the most vicious people on the planet.” Around 71% of immigrants detained have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
But while immigrants in the country without authorization start to arrive at the Everglades tent and trailer center, which has a capacity of 3,000 people, the DeSantis administration is already moving to open another 2,000-person detention center in Camp Blanding, the primary training center for the Florida National Guard.
Ahead of the start of operations, water seeped into a tent and created large puddles following a storm, where state and federal officials had posed for pictures and Gov. Ron DeSantis answered questions from the press on Tuesday. Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson from the Florida Division of Emergency Management, and DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, said the seams that allowed the water to come in had been fixed overnight.
Griffin also told reporters Wednesday morning that FDEM would be in charge of the facility with oversight from DHS.
Meanwhile, Democrats in the state Legislature and Congress sent letters to Uthmeier and DeSantis condemning the operation and demanding answers about the governor’s speedy takeover of the land owned by Miami-Dade County using authority under a state of emergency on illegal immigration he first declared in 2023.
Florida’s Democratic Congressional delegation expressed its concerns about environmental damage and the treatment of immigrants, who will sleep in bunk beds inside tents with A/C during the rising summer temperatures.
“We urge you to immediately reverse course, halt construction activity, and fully withdraw the proposal to establish any detention facility at the Dade-Collier site,” the Democrats wrote. “We further request that you commit to transparent and science-based environmental review process for any future development plans affecting the Everglades region.”
Environmental groups are waiting for a response from a federal judge out of the Southern District of Florida on their request to temporarily halt the Everglades detention center. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit Friday, arguing that the hasty, eight-day construction at the site violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), requiring public input and analysis of potential harms before construction.

Andre Bauer has launched a bid to unseat four-term U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026, saying he’s the “real MAGA” alternative for fed-up GOP voters.
Bauer, who left elected office in 2011 after losing a bid for governor, announced his candidacy Wednesday, The Associated Press first reported.
The 56-year-old former legislator and two-term lieutenant governor says he’s the true conservative who will fight to rein in federal spending and oppose sending troops and taxpayers’ money to fight wars overseas.
Calling South Carolina’s senior senator a “war monger and globalist,” Bauer told the SC Daily Gazette it doesn’t matter that Graham already has President Donald Trump’s endorsement for a fifth term.
“I am the real Trump guy. I’ve stuck with him the whole time,” Bauer said, noting Graham’s sometimes rocky relationship with the president over the last decade.

“He’s not MAGA,” Bauer said, referring to Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan and dubbing Graham as “liberal Lindsey.”
In response, Graham’s campaign stressed that Trump gave his “complete and total endorsement” to the incumbent senator. And just this week, the Senate Budget Committee chairman helped push Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” through the Senate to deliver the president’s “America First” agenda, said Graham campaign spokesperson Abby Zilch.
As for who’s MAGA, she recrafted the slogan for Bauer’s campaign: “This is all about Making Andre Great Again.”
Also this week, Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, signed on to Graham’s campaign staff, telling reporters “President Trump has made it clear that he wants Sen. Graham by his side to keep delivering results, and I’m proud to do my part to ensure that happens.”
LaCivita also has prior ties to Bauer, having run his unsuccessful 2010 campaign for governor.
Graham’s team
Graham, who launched his re-election bid in February, has a history of attracting — and besting — challengers from his right flank.
In 2014, he fended off six Republican opponents without needing a runoff. In 2020, he easily defeated three GOP challengers to his right before taking on Democrat Jaime Harrison, who lost by double digits in what was then the most expensive U.S. Senate race ever.
Beyond getting Trump’s endorsement for 2026, Graham’s re-election co-chairs are Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott. And a long list of GOP heavyweights helping him raise money include David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada and House speaker; former state GOP Chair Karen Floyd; and Ed McMullen, Trump’s former ambassador to Switzerland.
Still, Graham could face a tougher contest in a smaller GOP primary field.
Trump’s backing doesn’t guarantee the party faithful will support him, as seen at a Trump campaign event in Pickens on Independence Day two years ago, when the crowd booed Graham off the stage on his home turf. The Upstate event wasn’t far from his hometown of Seneca.
“You can bet Bauer heard that boo,” former SC GOP Chairman Katon Dawson told the SC Daily Gazette.
Dawson, whose tenure spanned campaigns by both Graham and Bauer, called both men “talented politicians” but said he expects Graham to be able to shake off many of the criticisms thrown his way.
“He can piss off one wing of the party, but that won’t be all of them,” Dawson said.
Time in office
Greenville businessman Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, launched his campaign to oust Graham in February. After putting $5 million of his own money into the campaign, he’s already running TV ads to boost his profile.

Bauer, who lives in Travelers Rest, has name recognition from his time in office, starting with his election to the state House in 1996 at age 27 representing a Lexington County district. Three years later, he won a special election for a state Senate seat spanning four counties before being elected lieutenant governor in 2002 at age 33. At the time, he was the youngest lieutenant governor in the country.
Still, it has been 13 years since Bauer has run for office and 19 years since he’s won.
Voters who have moved into the fast-growing state since then won’t know him.
Dawson said he saw it firsthand at a Nikki Haley campaign event during her failed presidential bid last year. Inside a crowded room in Beaufort, he said she asked the crowd how many knew her during her time as governor. Only about a quarter of the room raised their hands.
“There are lots of new voters up for grabs,” said Dawson, chairman from 2002 to 2009. “I’ve seen them; they’re out there. And they’re all along the coast.”
Bauer’s last campaign was in 2012 for the state’s then-new 7th Congressional District, when he a lost a runoff to eventual U.S. Rep. Tom Rice. In 2010, he placed last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won in a runoff by Haley, who went on to win the Governor’s Mansion that November.
In the interim, Bauer’s gotten married and become a father to four children ages 5 to 17. Having children changed his entire perspective, he said: “There’s a lot of growth from 40 to 56.”

“I think it’s a good break,” Dawson said of Bauer’s time away from office. “He’s still young.”
Still, the former GOP chairman was surprised to see Bauer taking on an entrenched U.S. senator with what Bauer estimates to be $70 million-plus in fundraising capacity. Graham currently has nearly $16 million on hand, according to the latest campaign filings.
Bauer said he recognizes the money disadvantage.
“This is fighting an Army with a toothpick,” he said. “When you’re part of the system, you’re going to raise a lot of money.”
But the former marathoner, who’s known to walk hundreds of miles over a campaign, plans to out-work Graham to convince voters “what true MAGA is.”
“I wouldn’t want to run against Andre Bauer,” Dawson said. “I think Andre’s asset is Andre. He’ll hang off bridges with signs if he has to.”
Graham’s advantages
But Dawson pointed to South Carolina’s history of re-electing long-time, incumbent senators of both parties.
Graham was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002 to replace retiring GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond, who left office after turning 100 and died six months later. U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings, who remained a Democrat over his four-decade tenure as he fought for balanced budgets, retired in 2004. He died in 2019 at age 97.
Dawson noted neither was voted out. And he said he’d be surprised if Graham doesn’t hold on to his seat. He considers Graham’s hawkish stances on foreign policy, to include his continued staunch support of Israel and approval of Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, to be a strength in this military friendly state.
“He’s got a lot of friends and he’s done a lot of favors,” Dawson said. “If anything, South Carolina likes a career politician who knows how to bring the bacon home. And Sen. Graham certainly does that.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9754-e1751497833645-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-07-02 20:05:39.873305

The Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Monday and Tuesday heard from the elected district attorneys from Santa Fe and Las Cruces, both of whom are critical of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s “case management order,” which sets deadlines for prosecutors to disclose evidence and schedule pretrial witness interviews.
The special rule, which first went into effect in Albuquerque-area courts in February 2015, is meant to resolve criminal cases without unneeded delays and reduce case backlogs by establishing deadlines for steps leading to trial.
At present, the rule applies only in the Second Judicial District in New Mexico’s most populous county of Bernalillo; the Third Judicial District, in the second most populous county of Doña Ana; and the Eighth Judicial District, which covers Union, Colfax and Taos counties.
First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, whose district covers Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties in Northern New Mexico, told the committee on Monday afternoon she expects the case management order will come to her area in January 2026.
She has been in talks with First Judicial District Court Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid about the process of adopting the special rule since the fall of 2023, according to a letter her office shared with Source NM. In that letter, she wrote that Biedscheid hasn’t given her, police or public defenders the opportunity to plan and prepare for the rule.
Under the rules in Bernalillo, Doña Ana and the Eighth Judicial District, the simplest cases must go to trial within about seven months and the most complex ones, including murder cases, must go to trial within approximately 15 months.
The rules require more complex cases to go to trial within a year if the person is held in jail, unless the defendant agrees to a longer period or uncontrollable circumstances occur. The rule also shortens deadlines for prosecutors to make evidence available to defense attorneys.
The same deadlines can be found in the proposed rule for the First Judicial District, which the Supreme Court has not yet ordered. It was not clear on Wednesday when the justices would actually make the rule final.
Carmack-Altwies told the committee in preparation for the order, she asked lawmakers in the most recent session for funding to pay for 13 new positions, but only received money for one.
As a result, Carmack-Altwies told the committee, if the order is implemented in her district, she predicts “thousands of cases are going to be dismissed.”
In addition to personnel and budget concerns, Carmack-Altwies’ office subsequently provided Source with a statement also citing insufficient input from DAs and law enforcement to the rule; lack of computer systems that communicate with law enforcement; and crime labs that are “months or years behind.” 
“People are going to get away with crime and then I believe 10-plus years down the road, you’re going to see an astonishing increase in — an escalation in crime,” she told lawmakers.
Source requested comment on Wednesday from the Administrative Office of the Courts and will update this story if received.
The order has its supporters, though.
Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the committee he believes in case management orders because in an overworked system, all parties tend to focus on the crisis in front of them, and not on the new cases coming in.
“You have to hold people’s feet to the fire to get the work done on cases, especially when people are sitting in custody,” Baur said.
Before case management orders came around, a lot of people were languishing in jail and victims were waiting for justice, he said.
“Without a case management order, what pressure is there on a crime lab to actually get the results in?” Baur asked. “There needs to be some flexibility. They are imperfect, but I think they’re really important to make sure that the system moves.”
When the conversation about case management orders continued on Tuesday, New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice David Thomson told the committee that when courts release someone and attach a GPS monitor to their ankle, and then their case takes a year to reach a trial, “those two things are not acceptable.”
“It’s important to bring them to trial on a timely basis on those charges, and then a jury can decide whether that individual is guilty or not,” Thomson said.
Ultimately, however, lawmakers have no sway over the rules.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) noted there were reasons for the case management order at the time, but he encouraged district attorneys and others to “put some friendly pressure on the Supreme Court to change that.”
“We can’t do it legislatively, but those hard-and-fast deadlines are unreasonable under the circumstances, and they need to be looked at,” Maestas said.

(Photo by Katrin Ray Shumakov/Getty images)Much like the sound level from across the bay on the Fourth of July, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) isn’t making noise about the opportunity for viewing fireworks from Beavertail State Park in Jamestown.
DEM spokesperson Kimberly Keough confirmed to Rhode Island Current that the state park will remain open Friday night for viewing of the city of Newport’s annual pyrotechnics show in the distance without having to deal with loud noise. The display is slated to kick off at 9:15 p.m. 
The Department has promoted the viewing since 2019 as a way for people who are sensitive to loud noises to enjoy the holiday fireworks.
But the state is no longer referring to the event as “Quiet Fireworks” — or promoting it at all. That’s because last year proved a little too popular.
“Last year, emergency responders had difficulty gaining access because of the number of cars in the park,” Keough said in an email Wednesday. “We don’t have an exact number. Last year there were more cars than spots available (150), with cars parking along roadways in both directions.
“Due to this public safety concern and staffing constraints, the event is not being promoted; however, people are still welcome to park and enjoy the fireworks,” she continued.
To avoid the kind of traffic congestion that occurred last year, Keough said the DEM will have two law enforcement officers at the park while Jamestown police will monitor the entrance.
Parking will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and the park will close once the lots are filled.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, spurred by Trump, will trim seven months off its environmental and safety review of Bill Gates-backed project.
The post Feds speed up review for Natrium nuclear power plant in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming may see its first commercial nuclear power plant a few months sooner than anticipated, but still sometime in 2030, according to the developer, TerraPower.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified the Belleview, Washington-based company Tuesday that it’s trimming seven months from an ongoing environmental review and safety evaluation of the proposed advanced, liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear reactor plant outside Kemmerer. That means it will complete its final environmental impact statement for a construction permit by Dec. 31, the agency said.
The move follows “frequent and productive engagements” with the operator, according to the commission, and brings the review process into compliance with an executive order President Donald Trump issued in May. The order was intended to reform the “NRC’s culture” and directed the agency to speed up permitting.
“This acknowledgement by the NRC that our application can be completed more quickly than originally anticipated is a testament to the incredible work by our Natrium team and the support for advanced reactors at the federal level,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a prepared statement.

Levesque also praised Trump for “founding” the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program during his first term. TerraPower was the first ever to submit a construction permit application for a “commercial advanced reactor” in March 2024.
“Streamlining reviews is a commonsense solution that will accelerate permitting schedules; and proves that we can bring safe, well-vetted American technologies to market faster and compete on the global stage,” Levesque said. 
The expedited review is cause for concern, Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Policy Director John Burrows told WyoFile. Residents deserve “robust and thorough” review to ensure safety, especially for an “experimental” technology such as TerraPower’s Natrium design, he said.
“Expediting the review process is not something that inspires confidence when the stakes are very high for this first-of-its-kind project,” Burrows said via email. “Similarly, the perception that the NRC is prioritizing speed over safety does not bode well for the future of nuclear technology in Wyoming — especially given the legacy of this industry and concerns that Wyomingites have raised in the past.”
The $4 billion project, backed by $2 billion from the Department of Energy, was already under a streamlined review process through the NRC’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. The plant will be operational in 2030, according to TerraPower. It will be the first utility-scale advanced nuclear power plant in the nation, the company said.
The Natrium project
After reviewing several potential sites in Wyoming, TerraPower announced in 2021 it would tap into existing infrastructure near the Naughton natural gas- and coal-fired power plant just outside the adjacent towns of Kemmerer and Diamondville in western Wyoming.
The company’s Natrium nuclear reactor is a scaled-down version of currently operating nuclear reactors. It will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of electricity — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — and will have the ability to boost the system’s output to 500 megawatts for short periods, according to the company.

TerraPower, backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, promotes Natrium as an “advanced” reactor design because it will use liquid sodium for cooling, which requires less water and provides more energy efficiency, it says. The plant will also use a different type of radioactive fuel referred to as high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is more potent than traditional nuclear fuels.
If the pilot project is successful, the company plans to deploy dozens of Natrium plants across the globe, and possibly several more in Wyoming.
Clearing permit hurdles
TerraPower commenced construction on some non-nuclear facilities associated with the project last year. The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council granted a construction permit in January, greenlighting all non-nuclear portions of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 plant.
The federal commission issued a draft environmental impact statement for the nuclear side of the project in June, one month ahead of schedule, it said. 
Though the federal agency is working under an expedited timeline, it warned there may be “unresolved items” related to any “substantive” public comments to address after the December deadline. “The accelerated timeline depends on a continued commitment from [the developer] to resolve these issues and provide necessary information in a timely manner,” the agency wrote in a letter to TerraPower.

About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid.,"Charles Sallee, right, speaks to a legislative committee in 2023 in Santa Fe. Sallee, the Legislative Finance Committee director, presented some lawmakers Wednesday with a sense of the tough choices they'll have to make if the ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" becomes law in a state with the highest per-capita reliance on SNAP and Medicaid.  (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A top budget adviser to New Mexico lawmakers Wednesday laid out the most detailed look he could muster on what the Senate budget reconciliation bill could mean for New Mexico, particularly when it comes to federal spending on health care and food aid here.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee’s presentation was to a special state legislative committee grappling with expected federal cuts. It comes a day after the United States Senate narrowly passed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which contains steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps payments over the next decade. The bill now heads back to the House.
Sallee said the Legislature’s approach in recent years of parking record oil and gas revenues in interest-earning reserve funds has insulated taxpayers from a devastating blow to the state budget. Despite that, the state cannot afford to “backfill” all the expected losses, and his team of analysts is only beginning to try to calculate the many indirect economic implications of the cuts, including to farms, hospitals and the state’s overall financial health. 
“I think fiscally, we’re in the best shape to be able to handle this,” Sallee said. But nonetheless: “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”
New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told the same committee Tuesday that as many as 88,530 New Mexicans will lose their Medicaid coverage due to provisions in the bill. The bill will also likely cause 58,180 New Mexicans to lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said. 
Those are significant cuts in the state that has the highest per-capita percentage of SNAP recipients and Medicaid recipients in the country. About one in four New Mexicans gets SNAP and about two in five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. 
New Mexico hospitals and patients face closure from ‘domino effect’ of potential Medicaid cuts

The Medicaid cuts would mean more than 10% of 878,000 New Mexicans who currently rely on Medicaid would lose their coverage. The SNAP cuts would mean about 13% of 463,000 SNAP recipients would lose their food benefits. 
In addition to those who lose their coverage or benefits outright, hundreds of thousands more will see benefits reduced or increased paperwork or other burdens, including work requirements, Armijo said.
Sallee tailored his presentation Wednesday to how the bill in its current form could affect state coffers and also detailed the federal budget deficit that Republican members of Congress say they’re trying to address with the cuts. Even with the lawmakers’ efforts to rein in spending, a Congressional Budget Office estimate concludes the bill will add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. 
Sallee stressed that lawmakers need to look closely at when certain provisions of the bill go into effect and consider the long view of the cuts, which are phased in over years in some cases over the course of a decade, as they consider the state’s response. 
Lawmakers will have to figure out how the state will respond to caps on provider taxes and Medicaid reimbursement that will hit rural hospitals especially hard, Sallee said. 
At least 15 rural New Mexico hospitals are vulnerable to closure due to provisions in the reconciliation, Democratic senators said in a letter in June to President Donald Trump. Six to eight of them could close here within 18 months, advocates and hospital executives said last month. 
The House and Senate will have to reconcile their different methods of reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates and provider taxes states use to increase the federal share of Medicaid payments, Sallee said Wednesday.

The Senate version reduced the tax limit by half a percent beginning next year, whereas the House version prohibits new provider taxes. The Senate version similarly phases in reductions in reimbursement rates versus the House’s approach, according to Sallee’s presentation. 
As for SNAP, uncertainty looms about whether New Mexico’s “error rate” will help or hurt it in the end, Sallee said. 
The reconciliation bill seeks to impose a share of administrative costs, as well as the cost of the benefits themselves, on states, with a higher percentage of that cost-share imposed on states that have a high degree of overpaying or underpaying SNAP benefits. New Mexico’s rate is about 14.6%, according to recent federal Agriculture Department estimates. 
The House version of the bill would make states pay between 5% and 25% of the benefit costs, plus 75% of administrative costs for SNAP, based on the error rate. A Senate version from mid-June reduces the benefit costs borne by states to between 5% and 15%. 
On Wednesday, Sallee said the Senate version of the bill passed overnight might actually “reward” states with high error rates, like New Mexico, by giving them until 2029 to fix their error rates before imposing the increased cost-share. 
“The language is not entirely clear exactly how this is going to work, who’s going to be really in or out,” he said. “But at the very least it looks like that’s an example of where you’re going to hear a lot of people saying there’s going to be big cuts for food security in New Mexico. And it’s like, let’s take a deep breath and figure out when exactly that’s going to occur, and then give you time as policy makers, to figure out how you’re going to deal with that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230817_103528-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

Aug. 10, 2024. (AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Kelli Austin is already juggling being in school, taking care of her children, and running a business. Now, the Waterville resident is worried she will have to choose between food and medicine. Or skip medical appointments so her kids can go to the doctor. 
“It’s not just me and my kids that are affected by this. There are so many kids right now with parents that are struggling, working two jobs already and juggling multiple hats just to just to barely get by,” she said.
Austin, like thousands of Mainers, relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and Medicaid, which she is scared she will lose because of work requirements in Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. 
“If this goes through, it’s not just numbers on a page,” she said. “It’s gonna be missed appointments, closed clinics and deferred dreams.”
Advocates are warning of the disastrous consequences if the budget reconciliation bill becomes law, including jeopardizing access to food and cutting health care from thousands of low income people and families. 
Interviews with representatives from half a dozen different groups underscored the concern that the effects of the bill will also be felt by middle class families, small businesses and rural hospitals for years to come.
The bill, which Maine’s entire congressional delegation voted against, is slated for a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, though stalled due to some Republican resistance. The Senate version, which Republican Sen. Susan Collins voted against after initially casting a vote to advance the bill, added provisions that made the bill worse, many experts said.  
“It is one of the largest transfers of wealth and greatest cuts to health care and food assistance in this country’s history,” said Alex Carter, a policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, a civil legal aid and economic justice organization. “I don’t think it’s dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.”
The bill restricts access to Medicaid, institutes work requirements for food and health care assistance, makes certain reproductive health providers ineligible for federal funding and requires states to cover some SNAP costs, the federal government currently funds. It will also increase premiums for marketplace health insurance. All those cuts are meant to pay for extending tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term that mostly benefit the wealthy, as well as fund a significant increase in immigration enforcement.
Many of the advocates who spoke with Maine Morning Star emphasized these provisions will be particularly challenging for a rural, aging state like Maine, where food insecurity, child hunger and health care infrastructure are already stressed and the state does not have extra funding to make up for federal cuts.










I don't think it's dramatic or hyperbolic to say that people are going to go hungry. People are going to not be able to meet their basic needs, and people are going to die if this bill passes.


– Alex Carter, Maine Equal Justice


“When you look at this bill and what it means for Maine and for Maine people, it effectively means that we’re going to lose services,” said Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
While much of the bill’s opposition has focused on the threats to Medicaid — which an estimated 30,000 Mainers could lose as a result  — there are other compounding impacts that target the same groups of people whose health care is at risk, Martin and others explained.
The impacts may not be felt immediately because different provisions in the bill take effect on different timelines (including some as late as 2028), but “it’s going to take two to three years before people really start to understand how significant this legislation is going to impact them and their communities,” Martin said.
Nutrition assistance impact 
The bill will, for the first time, make states like Maine bear some of the cost of SNAP. According to the bill, states with a higher rate of errors, meaning benefits incorrectly issued, will have to bear up to 15% of the costs of the program, which could cost the state up to $60 million in benefits —  an unsustainable burden that could effectively dismantle the entire program, according to Anna Korsen, policy and program director at Full Plates, Full Potential, which advocates for state and federal support for child nutrition. 
The bill also introduces stringent work reporting requirements that would make nutrition benefits harder to obtain and maintain, particularly for families with children and older adults. 
Although the vast majority of the 176,000 Mainers who use SNAP meet the work requirements, Korsen said the administrative challenge of filling out SNAP benefit forms is already daunting for families. Adding the additional work requirement will push people out of the program, she said.
“The problem isn’t that people aren’t working. The challenge that they’re creating is that people are going to get caught up in all of this red tape and paperwork,” she said. ​“So what they’re trying to do is just make SNAP harder to get and harder to keep.”
When she was finishing school, Austin was part of Maine’s Parents as Scholars financial aid program, which made her eligible for federal assistance. But under the budget bill, she will have to meet work requirements to be eligible for SNAP and Medicaid, which she said is a challenge as a single mom. 
“I struggle just to get by as it is, let alone taking me out of the house for that many hours and making me juggle that much more,” she said. “It’s not that we’re unwilling to work, it’s that we’re underserved.”
“I’m not asking for a handout by any right, but I’m asking for a fair shot for myself and my kids,” Austin added.
Calling Medicaid a ‘lifeline’ for Mainers, health advocates urge Collins to oppose GOP budget bill

The changes would not only impact food security but also harm local economies, with SNAP benefits generating nearly $548 million in annual economic activity in Maine. Small grocery stores could lose up to 20% of their revenue, and local farms could also suffer significant setbacks by losing the revenue that comes from SNAP. 
Korsen argued that the bill’s provisions create an all-or-nothing scenario for states, forcing them to either pay massive new costs or opt out of the SNAP program entirely.
Indirectly, the legislation also threatens other forms of food assistance, such as free school meals, summer nutrition programs, and WIC benefits, because if a family qualifies for Medicaid or SNAP benefits, they are automatically eligible for free meals. This direct certification allows school districts to be accurately reimbursed by the federal government for providing those meals.
“Schools are scared, families are scared,” Korsen said. “It’s just unbelievable that our government would think that this is okay.”
The proposal also ends the work requirement exemption for homeless people and veterans on SNAP, which means thousands of vulnerable people could go hungry, according to Terence Miller, advocacy director at the Portland-based homeless services organization Preble Street. 
That would put even more strain on privately run food banks, which already faced setbacks when the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut programs that allow them to buy from local farms.
“I mean, a veteran who fought for our country and finds themselves unhoused and needing food is no longer eligible to receive SNAP benefits,” he said. “It’s just unfathomable to me to think that those people will not be able to buy their own food.”
Impact on marketplace health insurance 
In addition to sweeping Medicaid cuts, thousands of Maine residents who rely on marketplace health insurance could see their premiums dramatically increase. 
According to an analysis by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, approximately 63,000 Mainers with marketplace coverage will be significantly impacted by the expiration of premium tax credits, Martin said.
For example, a family of four earning around $78,000 annually could see its monthly premiums double from $263 to $476. Even more stark are the potential increases for older residents: a 62-year-old couple earning $85,000 might face a premium jump from $608 to $2,346 per month.
Those premium tax credits have been crucial in making health insurance affordable, Martin explained. About 85% of marketplace participants currently receive these subsidies, which help cap health insurance costs for individuals and families.
The potential elimination of these credits represents more than just a financial burden, Martin added, it could force many Maine residents to choose between maintaining health coverage or cutting other essential expenses. 
“At the same time that health coverage is being taken away from low income households and individuals and people with disabilities, we’re also seeing a scenario in which arguably middle class families are likely to see a significant increase in costs for themselves as a consequence of this,” Martin said.

(Provided by the S.C.

Gary Terry was convicted in 1997 of raping and killing a neighbor in her West Columbia home. Terry, now 57, has claimed that he and 47-year-old Urai Jackson were having a consensual relationship but that he struck her over the head during an argument, accidentally killing her.

After running out of normal appeals, Terry received a temporary reprieve after claiming that he had an intellectual disability, which would mean he couldn’t be executed. Brain scans showed that Terry had damage in the part of his brain responsible for controlling focus and behavior, likely caused by a small stroke, his attorneys argued in court filings.
But Terry’s attorneys failed to prove in court that Terry had enough damage to his brain to warrant pausing his execution, meaning his death sentence “must be carried out,” Circuit Court Judge Robert Hood wrote in a decision filed Tuesday.
Terry’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
It’s unclear whether there will be additional appeals and when an execution might be scheduled.
The state Supreme Court typically sends out death warrants on Fridays, but because this Friday is a holiday, the soonest Terry might receive a warrant would be July 11.
By state law, executions must take place at 6 p.m. on the fourth Friday after a death warrant is issued.
In order for inmates to avoid the death chamber, they must prove they have “significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning” that causes “adaptive behavior” before the age of 18, Hood wrote.
Scans of Terry’s brain showed dead tissue and decreased blood flow to part of his brain. He suffered multiple head injuries before the crime for which he was convicted, including while working for a tree company in Florida, in a motorcycle accident and during a fight in which someone hit him over the head with a board, his mother testified during his 1997 trial.
Terry also started lashing out and showing problems with impulsivity after sniffing glue and losing consciousness when he was 13, his mother testified. He was later diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder, a mental health condition that causes short bouts of rage, as well as antisocial personality disorder and alcohol dependance, according to court filings.
Still, Terry’s intellectual functioning remained in the “low-average” range, which is not enough to constitute an intellectual disability. An expert who testified during Terry’s 1997 trial agreed with that conclusion, and the experts who testified on behalf of Terry during a 2024 hearing in Lexington County failed to prove any different, Hood wrote.
“The record also shows a history not of intellectual disability but of learning disabilities and drug use, which began as a teenager, and later in life, head injuries,” Hood wrote.
Terry is one of 25 inmates on South Carolina’s death row. One inmate is held in California for crimes committed in that state.
Six other inmates have been put to death since the state resumed executions in September. That followed a 13-year unintended hiatus, during which the state’s supply of lethal injection drugs expired and couldn’t be restocked.
Under an updated law keeping nearly all information about executions secret, officials were able to obtain pentobarbital, a sedative that is lethal in large doses. Last July, the state Supreme Court officially allowed the process to resume by ruling that electrocution and firing squad — a method legislators added to state law in 2021 — were constitutional.
Two inmates have since elected to die by firing squad. The rest have chosen lethal injection.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0541-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

Andy Kim and Cory Booker said Wednesday. (Spencer Platt | Getty Images)Several of New Jersey’s Democratic leaders are blasting President Donald Trump’s nomination of Alina Habba as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey as a partisan power grab aimed at reshaping the state to serve his political agenda. 
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who previously worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said Habba is unqualified for the job. Habba, 41, had no prosecutorial experience when Trump appointed her in an interim capacity in March. 
“Habba has explicitly stated her goal to politicize the office where I served as a prosecutor, and as acting U.S. Attorney, she has already weaponized it against her perceived political opponents,” Sherrill said in a statement Wednesday. 
The White House announced Tuesday that Trump nominated Habba to a full four-year term. When he previously named her as the interim attorney, Trump said Habba would “fight tirelessly to secure a legal system that is both fair and just for the wonderful people of New Jersey.”
Within days of assuming her role, Habba said she would investigate Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s immigration directive limiting law enforcement’s cooperation in civil immigration investigations. She also said on a conservative podcast that she hopes to “turn New Jersey red.” 
In less than four months as acting U.S. Attorney, Habba has drawn ire from judges for ignoring the historically nonpartisan stance of the office. 
She’s targeted Democratic officials who have opposed Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested May 9 outside an immigrant detention facility in the city. Habba later charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, with assault in connection with a scuffle that broke out when Baraka was detained. McIver pleaded not guilty to the charges and faces a trial in November. 
When Baraka’s charges were dropped 10 days after his arrest, a judge scolded prosecutors from Habba’s office, warning them that it should not be used to “satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas.” 
Baraka sued Habba over his arrest, claiming he was maliciously prosecuted out of political retribution. Habba responded by saying the mayor should join her in “prioritizing violent crime and public safety.” 
In a joint statement Wednesday, Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker, both Democrats, also accused Habba of degrading her office. 
“The people of New Jersey deserve a U.S. Attorney that has deep experience with law enforcement, a reputation and an approach that puts partisanship to the side and who will work to keep our communities safe and impartially pursue justice,” they said. “In her short tenure as an interim U.S. Attorney, she has degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
Habba hasn’t responded to the criticism but did repost a defense on social media Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who called her “a fearless, fair, and effective public servant.”
Habba must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of July, but a confirmation hearing has not yet been scheduled. Her 120-day interim appointment expires in three weeks, but judges in New Jersey’s U.S. District Court could allow her to stay pending confirmation.

I think cruelty is the point,” Feist, 61, of Washington, D.C., and originally from North Dakota, told States Newsroom. “It's also extremely alarming that there's such cowardice in the GOP.”The massive budget reconciliation package, passed by Senate Republicans Tuesday with a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance, extends and expands 2017 tax cuts at a cost of roughly $4.5 trillion over the next decade. It also yanks funding from federal food and health safety net programs.

The bill aggressively rolls back clean energy tax credits, as well as raising the nation’s borrowing limit to $5 trillion.Latest figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show the package would add $3.4 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade, when the country is mired in record-breaking debt. That office’s earlier analysis of the House-passed bill found the package would reduce resources for low-income families while padding higher earners.Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, who chaired an hours-long final committee hearing about the bill overnight, said Wednesday the package is an “embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that.”Medicaid cutsTop of mind for Feist is the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income individuals and some with disabilities. The Senate version of the package, passed Tuesday, included a  $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over 10 years, according to the CBO.“I have parents in North Dakota who are 85 and 86. They already have difficulty seeing their doctor. For every doctor that leaves, he takes on 14 times more burden. Rural health care is already extremely difficult. I would expect there will not be a hospital near where my parents live if this bill is signed into law,” said Feist, whose parents live near Minot.Rural hospitals rely on Medicaid payments. In a last-minute move before Tuesday’s vote, Senate Republicans doubled a fund to $50 billion to subsidize hospitals that will lose funding. Critics say that amount is not enough to fill the gap.GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina voted no after voicing concerns over Medicaid cuts.SNAP and ICEMark Starr sang a protest song he wrote about the “big beautiful bill” as he played guitar and harmonica outside the Longworth House Office Building Wednesday.The 39-year-old Albuquerque, New Mexico, native told States Newsroom he drove to the capital in late April to begin protesting the bill. He said he’s particularly focused on additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement contained in the package as well as cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food benefits to low-income households.

(Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom) “New Mexico is pretty poor, and so if these cuts to SNAP go, kids can go hungry in New Mexico,” Starr said. “It's just, like, really gonna mess us up, and we're just one of the many states that will be affected that way.”New Mexico has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation.A provision in the bill will shift food assistance costs to state governments for the first time in the federal program’s history. Critics worry that states could tighten eligibility requirements or drop the program because of the financial burden.The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates 55,000 teens age 14 and up, and adults up to age 64 could lose food assistance in New Mexico because of the bill’s cuts to state work requirement waivers. Children would remain eligible but households would overall see significantly decreased SNAP dollars.The CBO found in late May that the House-passed bill would result in over 3 million people nationwide losing food assistance.Starr said he’s also against additional funding provided for immigration enforcement.“I think they have enough,” he said, pointing to Trump’s visit to a new detention facility in Florida that the White House is touting as “Alligator Alcatraz.”The Senate-approved version includes an additional $45 billion for ICE detention facilities and $29.9 billion for ICE enforcement and deportation, among billions more directed toward the Southern border.Clean energy to take a hitTiernan Sittenfeld, of the League of Conservation Voters, huddled just outside the House with a group wearing t-shirts that read “Hands off our air, land and clean energy.”Sittenfeld, the organization’s senior vice president of government affairs, argues the rollbacks of clean energy tax credits in the Senate version will “kill clean energy jobs.”“It is bad for our economy. It's bad for jobs. It's going to raise people's energy bills. And of course, it's bad for the planet,” she said.Senate Republicans accelerated the phase-out of some residential, manufacturing and production credits at a faster rate than the House bill. A last-minute change loosened the timeline on some tech-neutral energy credits though, and removed a previously added tax on wind and solar projects.

Industry groups and energy companies small and large have warned early termination of the credits will have a major impact on growth.The tax credits for solar, wind, batteries for energy storage, and electric vehicles, among others, were enacted under Democrats’ own 2022 budget reconciliation bill known as the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The majority of investment in new clean energy manufacturing and production has been concentrated in rural states and states that elected Trump to his second term, according to data collected since 2022 by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.“Any Republican who votes for this legislation is voting against the interest of their constituents, voting to kill jobs in their district, voting to kill clean energy projects, voting to make their constituents’ energy bills go up,” Sittenfeld said.Far-right House members who as of Wednesday afternoon were withholding their votes maintain the rollbacks on the clean energy tax cuts, which",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986

The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday it has frozen six federal programs that collectively distribute $6.8 billion across the country. The federal agency said it would not send out the money by July 1, the start of the 2026 fiscal year for states and schools, because it is still reviewing the funding.
“The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities and the department’s statutory responsibilities,” the agency wrote in a message to states.
Withheld funds include nearly $31.37 million that Oklahoma districts use for teacher professional development, $15.68 million that support before- and after-school programs, $6.43 million dedicated for the 13% of Oklahoma students learning English as their non-native language and $240,000 for the children of migrant workers. Another $7.3 million for adult education in Oklahoma also is affected.
The Trump administration also said it froze funds from Title IV Part A, which provide $16.35 million for academic enrichment in Oklahoma schools. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Education said it started receiving money from this program for the 2026 fiscal year.
Federal dollars from the other affected funds have not yet arrived, the state department reported last week.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters advised schools to budget only for federal funds that already have been awarded.
“We appreciate the fact that the Trump administration is working diligently to ensure our taxpayer dollars are being stewarded with care,” Walters said in a statement. “(The state Department of Education) is working in lockstep with the Trump administration to assist with our mutually-aligned education priorities.”
Walters also took to social media to mock California being frozen out of the same programs that Oklahoma and all other states are currently unable to access.
In response to California state Superintendent Tony Thurmond saying the Trump administration’s withholding of funds “will harm students” and “cannot stand,” Walters wrote in a Tuesday post, “Don’t break the law by pushing racist CRT and DEI tactics, by push LGBTQ ideology on kids, and even allow boys to compete in women’s sports.”
The U.S. Department of Education has proposed eliminating the affected programs in future years. Instead, it aims to give out larger, more flexible grants that state leaders can decide how to spend.
In Oklahoma City Public Schools, 47% of students are learning English as their second language. The district expected $1.1 million in federal revenue from Title III, which supports English learners, according to its annual budget, which the Oklahoma City Board of Education approved Monday.
Oklahoma City schools also projected $7.6 million in Title II funds for teacher professional development, up from $3.3 million last year.

“We urge federal leaders to reconsider this action, as these dollars directly support essential staff and programs that make a difference for our students every day,” district spokesperson Crystal Raymond said in a statement. “These funds are critical to our ability to support educators and deliver on our commitment to student success. As always, we will continue to put students first, and we look forward to welcoming our 33,000 students back to classrooms on Aug. 13.”
Now-frozen federal dollars also enable before- and after-school programs across the state, mostly in rural areas. Money for the initiative comes from Title IV Part B, also known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers.
Eufaula Public Schools in eastern Oklahoma receives $300,000 from this program to fund its after-school care and summer learning, Superintendent Monty Guthrie said.
The district also receives about $50,000 for teacher recruitment and professional development from Title II, also known as “supporting effective instruction.” Teacher development needs have become more expensive, Guthrie said, as emergency certified educators and uncertified adjunct teachers become more common in Oklahoma.
Federal money for after-care programs allows Eufaula schools to provide these services for free to low-income families who otherwise wouldn’t be able to pay, Guthrie said. About 180 students participate throughout the school year.
These programs are a “huge, huge plus,” he said, especially in rural towns that have few other childcare options.
Eufaula schools would need to receive federal funds by November for the program to be financially viable this school year, Guthrie said. Otherwise, the district would have to discontinue the services, “which would be very difficult for our families.”
“You just have to plan to continue on, and if things change we’ll have to adjust,” Guthrie said. “We certainly feel that it is a great service to our students and our parents, and we’re going to try to provide that.”

Read this story in English.
El 30 de mayo, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de EE. UU. (DHS) publicó una lista de más de 500 ciudades, condados y estados que designó como jurisdicciones “santuario”. El propio estado de Connecticut, además de seis de sus municipios, figuraban en la lista, ahora eliminada.
Algunos representantes locales se sorprendieron al ver a sus municipios en la lista. Otros no.
El término “ciudad santuario” es controvertido porque no tiene una definición legal oficial, pero generalmente se refiere a las jurisdicciones que limitan su cooperación con las autoridades federales de inmigración.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las ciudades santuario y la reacción de los funcionarios de Connecticut ante la designación del DHS.
¿Qué son las ciudades santuario?
Según Global Refuge, una organización sin fines de lucro que ayuda a las personas a establecerse en EE. UU., las ciudades santuario tienen políticas que establecen límites sobre la información o el apoyo que los gobiernos locales o estatales brindan a las autoridades federales de inmigración. 
El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, por su parte, clasifica una jurisdicción santuario como “ciudades, condados y estados que obstruyen deliberadamente la aplicación de las leyes federales de inmigración y ponen en peligro a los ciudadanos estadounidenses”.
Según la organización nacional Vera Institute of Justice, las ciudades santuario suelen ubicarse en zonas con grandes poblaciones de inmigrantes.
Según el Consejo Americano de Inmigración, algunas de las llamadas “políticas santuario” pueden incluir medidas como: limitar la capacidad de la policía local o estatal para “arrestar o detener a personas por violaciones civiles federales de inmigración”; prohibir acuerdos de cooperación como el 287(g), que permite al ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas) designar a agentes locales; impedir que el personal local pregunte sobre el estatus migratorio o restringir la información que se puede compartir con agencias federales.
¿Qué ciudades de Connecticut estaban en la lista?
Las ciudades de East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford y Hamden fueron incluidas en la lista del DHS. El propio estado de Connecticut también fue designado como “jurisdicción santuario”. El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no explicó por qué se citó específicamente a estas ciudades de Connecticut ni cuáles fueron los criterios para su inclusión en la lista. Tampoco explicó por qué se eliminó la lista.
De los municipios incluidos en la lista, solo Hartford y Windham han promulgado resoluciones que se autodenominan ciudades santuario, mientras que New Haven y Hamden se han designado como “Ciudades Acogedoras”.
En un comunicado, la ciudad de East Haven afirmó que su inclusión en la lista fue incorrecta. “Seamos claros: ninguna agencia federal informó a la ciudad de East Haven sobre esta designación, ni estamos de acuerdo con ella”, afirmaba el comunicado.
“La clasificación emitida por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional no solo fue absurda, sino también infundada”, declaró el alcalde de East Haven, Joseph A. Carfora. “Antes de que se eliminara la página, mi administración contactó al DHS para exigir una aclaración y comprender cómo se hizo una declaración tan infundada sin consultar ni comunicarse con nuestra oficina. No permitiremos que East Haven sea malinterpretada sin rendir cuentas.”
Sin embargo, los funcionarios de New Haven y Windham también afirmaron que nunca recibieron notificación de su inclusión en la lista. “Windham tiene una gran población latina y es bien sabido que la actual administración [federal] se centra en las comunidades pobres, ya que contamos con recursos limitados”, declaró el alcalde Thomas DeVivo.
El alcalde de New London, Michael Passero, afirmó desconocer la definición de ciudad santuario. “Solo puedo decirles que New London nunca se ha declarado ciudad santuario”, afirmó.
¿Cuáles son las políticas de la ciudad en materia de inmigración?
No todas las ciudades se consideran ciudades santuario, pero todas tienen políticas que abordan la inmigración de alguna manera. 
En New Haven, el alcalde Justin Elicker firmó una orden ejecutiva de “Ciudad Acogedora” en 2020, afirmando “el compromiso de la ciudad de garantizar que los residentes se sientan seguros al acceder a los servicios públicos”.
La directiva prohíbe a los empleados municipales preguntar o revelar el estatus migratorio de una persona, a menos que lo exija la ley estatal o federal. Elicker declaró en una conferencia de prensa el mes pasado que New Haven no obstruye la justicia. Añadió que las políticas de bienvenida de la ciudad hacen que la comunidad sea más segura al animar a las personas a denunciar delitos, buscar atención médica y enviar a sus hijos a la escuela sin temor.
“Esto era algo que esperábamos y estamos orgullosos de ello”, declaró en una conferencia de prensa, refiriéndose a la inclusión de New Haven en la lista de ciudades santuario. “New Haven se enorgullece de ser una ciudad acogedora… Nuestra comunidad inmigrante es parte de nuestra familia New Haven”.
La política de East Haven es que, dado que la aplicación de las leyes migratorias es responsabilidad del gobierno federal, el Departamento de Policía de East Haven generalmente no participa en operaciones de ICE, excepto “cuando se le solicite formalmente como parte de una investigación criminal en curso, o para notificar a los funcionarios federales en situaciones graves donde se perciba una amenaza a la seguridad pública o nacional”.
El Código de Ordenanzas de Hartford declara oficialmente a Hartford como una “ciudad santuario”. Las leyes locales establecen que todos los residentes de Hartford, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, tienen igual acceso a los servicios municipales y a las derivaciones a agencias médicas o sociales. Esta política no impide que los empleados municipales cooperen con las autoridades federales de inmigración cuando sea legalmente requerido.
Las políticas de Hamden limitan la participación de la policía local en la aplicación de las leyes migratorias federales. Los agentes no pueden preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté relacionado con una investigación criminal, ni interrogar a víctimas o testigos sobre su estatus. Tampoco pueden arrestar ni detener a personas basándose únicamente en órdenes de detención civiles u órdenes administrativas, excepto según lo exija la ley estatal. Los recursos municipales, incluyendo la policía y el personal escolar, no pueden utilizarse para ayudar a ICE a menos que así lo exija una ley estatal o una orden de un juez federal.
New London ha compartido en su sitio web municipal el Plan de Preparación Familiar: Preparando a la Familia para la Aplicación de la Ley de Inmigración. Este es un documento estatal que contiene información para familias preocupadas por la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, no específico de New London.
El Departamento de Policía de New London prohíbe a los oficiales preguntar sobre el estatus migratorio a menos que esté directamente relacionado con una investigación criminal, según una orden ejecutiva local. Los oficiales tampoco pueden detener o interrogar a personas únicamente por sospechas de violaciones migratorias, pero la política establece que la policía local puede ayudar a las autoridades federales si se les solicita.
Windham se convirtió en una ciudad santuario tras una resolución de 2017 aprobada por unanimidad. La resolución reafirmó su compromiso de proteger a todos los residentes, incluyendo a los inmigrantes indocumentados que contribuyen a la comunidad. También establece que ningún funcionario o personal municipal arrestará, detendrá ni denunciará a una persona basándose únicamente en su estatus migratorio o de ciudadanía, excepto debido a una orden judicial penal válida o para cumplir con una orden de detención migratoria civil.

On Tuesday, as the federal government continued its unprecedented attack on clean energy and climate funding, Vermont’s Climate Council published its 2025 Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resiliency in the state.
The plan is a requirement set by the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act to publish a new framework every four years for tackling the climate crisis. The 2025 plan could guide legislative action on helping Vermonters, especially those with low or moderate incomes, adopt more efficient and less polluting sources of home heat and transportation, the two highest-emitting sectors in the state. 
Other priorities included mitigating future climate hazards, building a climate-ready workforce, weatherizing an additional 79,000 homes, reducing or sequestering emissions on farmland and finding funding to implement all these ideas.
While Vermont files its second Climate Action Plan to try and meet legally-binding emissions reductions, federal funding programs that made possible climate initiatives in small states like this one are on the chopping block. Now, as the state looks for other sources of revenue and support to achieve its climate goals, the new plan lays out what Vermonters might see prioritized in the coming years. But with reduced political will in the last legislative session to proactively deal with climate change, it remains to be seen whether those plans are fiscally realistic under a governor who prioritizes short-term affordability over long-term resiliency.

“Before focusing too much on a new, shiny thing, we should really be thinking about how we maintain the current pace and level of effort,” said Julie Moore, Agency of Natural Resources secretary and a member of the Climate Council who voted for the plan. “Maintaining our current pace is far from certain in this moment.” 
The state’s initial Climate Action Plan preceded devastating floods that wrecked homes and businesses along Vermont’s river valleys in 2023 and 2024. As the atmosphere warms, holding more moisture, precipitation in Vermont has become heavier and more frequent, causing deluges that can lead to deadly floods. 
Climate change, largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has also brought increased high heat days that most homes in Vermont are ill-equipped to handle. Wildland fires have become more common and air quality has diminished in the warmer months as enormous wildfires burn elsewhere, according to the plan.
But even with the tangible effects of climate change in Vermont, state lawmakers’ attempts to significantly reduce emissions along outlines from the 2021 Climate Action Plan have failed to meet state emissions targets. Big proposals like the clean heat standard were shelved during the spring legislative session, and the state likely missed its 2025 emissions-reduction target required by the Global Warming Solutions Act. A court case currently playing out in Montpelier could help determine whether the state missed that target.
Now, as the state looks for more guidance on how to lower its emissions, the federal government could squeeze Vermont further as the Trump administration eviscerates clean energy funding and advances in climate science prioritized under President Biden. The 2025 Climate Action Plan recognized the impact of federal cuts, noting that the work to combat climate change was not about to get easier.

What’s in the plan?
The Global Warming Solutions Act binds the state to lower greenhouse gas emissions by milestones set in state statute: 26% below 2005 emissions levels by 2025, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. 
The Climate Action Plan outlines pathways to reach those goals every four years, through Climate Council planning meetings, technical analysis with consultants, and community input. More than 1,000 Vermonters and Vermont-based organizations participated in creating the plan, including 850 who joined virtual and in-person meetings and 250 who submitted public comments, according to the plan.
But even with four years of planning, Vermont is still behind its legally-binding goals. While the state initially claimed that it reached that first milestone on Jan. 1, 2025, a report by the Energy Action Network, a Vermont-based collective of energy nonprofits, instead found Vermont to have fallen up to 39% short of the emissions reduction required by law. 
Moore’s agency reviewed the report and has agreed that the state was unlikely to achieve the 2025 goal, but final datasets to assess emissions won’t be available until 2027.
Previous ambitious reductions programs like the clean heat standard were shelved after a campaign by out-of-state fuel lobbyists along with Gov. Phil Scott’s rejection of the plan as unaffordable. State regulators found costs associated with the program were too high, but some members of the Climate Council disagree with those fiscal priorities. 
“When we have a conversation on benefits and costs, we can’t lose sight of the cost of the status quo, which is already too high,” said Jared Duval, one of the 23 state-appointed members of the Climate Council. He quoted numbers from the state tax department that found about $2 billion a year was spent on fossil fuels for transportation and heating in 2024. An economic analysis done for the Climate Action Plan identified a potential $6 billion in costs that could be avoided by 2050 if the state pursued emissions reductions recommendations, Duval said. 
With the lapse in federal funding, Duval said that in order to reduce emissions, the state would need to return to the polluter-pays principle, where fossil fuel corporations are responsible for paying for climate damages and resiliency efforts. This principle doesn’t only apply to the state’s legal battle with fossil fuel corporations in the climate superfund law, Duval said. It also stands as the rationale behind ambitious programs like the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest model, which the climate action plan asked the state to research this year. 
“The cost of those policies has always been designed to apply to importers of fossil fuels to Vermont,” Duval said. While fuel companies have said those costs will be passed onto customers, Duval said a key difference between the clean heat standard, pursued through the 2021 climate action plan, and the cap-and-invest model, again pushed forward by the 2025 plan, is that cap-and-invest can provide direct payments to Vermonters through rebates, based on their income. 
Duval, along with 15 others, voted for the 2025 plan. Two councillors were not present to vote, and five voted against it, including Sarah Clark, the Agency of Administration secretary; Anson Tebbetts, the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets secretary; Michele Boomhower on behalf of Joe Flynn, the Agency of Transportation secretary; Lindsay Kurrle, Agency of Commerce and Community Development secretary; and Matt Cota, owner of Meadow Hill Consulting and representing the fuel sector. All except for Cota are in Gov. Scott’s administration and report to the governor, who has worked to overturn the legal requirements in the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
Others were reluctant with their yes votes. While Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources,, voted for the plan, she said that decision was mainly a reflection of her appreciation of the work of state government staff. Moore said she continues to have “some real concerns.”
“Specifically, I’m concerned about what it will take to operationalize the plan’s vision,” Moore said. “It’s sort of left up to interpretation.”
The Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the state last year claiming the Agency of Natural Resources failed to properly prepare to meet the 2025 emissions goal, called the 2025 Climate Action Plan “toothless” in a statement on Tuesday. 
“The Council has worked hard to come to a consensus and deliver recommendations that include financial incentives to drive down emissions,” said Elena Mihaly, the foundation’s vice president for Vermont. “But it has failed to put in place real, enforceable policies that demand major polluters do their part too.”

The return of cap-and-invest
Much of the council’s attention this last year has been on a cap-and-invest program to reduce climate pollution. Cap-and-invest programs place a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state, while reinvesting the proceeds to climate-friendly projects like energy efficiency and weatherization. In March, Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer, spoke to the council during a special session on cap-and-invest, reminding members that of the billions the state spends on fossil fuels, “over 75% of those dollars flow out of the state.”
But a cap-and-invest model could keep more money in the state and create up to 810 jobs, according to Pieciak, especially if the state were to partner with cap-and-invest initiatives already underway such as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, Quebec and Washington, and the cap-and-invest program in New York state. A modified clean heat standard could complement this program, according to the 2025 Climate Action Plan, focusing on the electrification of air and water heating in low- and moderate-income households. 
Such a partnership could avoid problems that Vermont encountered while pursuing a clean heat standard, the council’s previous plan to reduce thermal emissions. In a January report, the Public Utility Commission, which studied the clean heat program, told lawmakers that it would likely be too expensive for the state to take on a first-of-its-kind credit market on its own. 
But this isn’t the first time cap-and-invest has been studied. Over the last four years, the Legislature asked the agency, under guidance from the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to dig into both the clean heat standard and the cap-and-invest program. 
“We’re a little bit taken aback by the price tag associated with each one, along with the administrative complexity,” Moore said. “I’m hopeful that there will be an opportunity for conversation about both what we can do with existing resources.”
Moore said the cap-and-invest program could only work if Vermont joins a multi-state program, and the only one that currently exists – the Western Climate Initiative – has indicated they’re not accepting new members, she said. New York’s plan for cap-and-invest, which could be a better fit as a neighboring state, is not yet operational. Instead, Moore said, the state should focus on more actionable items like continuing to weatherize homes as federal funding disappears. 
“It’s absolutely important to acknowledge long term savings associated with these practices, but you can’t gloss over the fact that there are real and significant upfront costs,” Moore said. “Figuring out how to pay for this work to generate long-term savings is fundamental, and the climate plan, I feel, doesn’t give enough treatment to that issue.” 
Richard Cowart, the former chair of the Public Utility Commission and a member of the Climate Council, said the 2025 plan did a good job marrying provisions that can help communities become more resilient against the impacts of climate change alongside measures to reduce carbon emissions, while also saving the state money.
“The notion that addressing climate change has to be viewed simply as a burden is incorrect,” Cowart said, noting that instead the state’s economy could benefit from doing its part to slow the warming world. “How can we afford to continue to spend $2 billion a year to import fossil fuels that we know that we shouldn’t actually be burning?”
He pointed to Efficiency Vermont as an example of how the state has invested in efficiency, saved money, and provided environmental and health benefits. The 2025 plan builds on that experience, he said, and shows that the state doesn’t require federal money to build important programs like the first-of-its-kind utility launched a quarter century ago. 
“We did not need money to launch Efficiency Vermont, instead we made our own decision to reduce bills for Vermonters,” Cowart said. “We can and need to do the same thing with respect to our ongoing fossil fuel bills.”
Federal funding cuts
But how the state will pay for myriad programs and strategies the 2025 plan puts forward appears to be the crux of the climate debate in Vermont, as the arguments over affordability continue. 
On the federal level, the attack on climate action has never been more brutal. For months, the Trump administration has worked to gut billions of dollars in renewable energy incentives and subsidies for proven initiatives like buying electric vehicles and scaling up charging infrastructure, increasing financial access to heat pumps and solar panels, and supporting big-budget projects like green hydrogen and wind energy.
“The cost of electricity to the people you represent and the folks I represent in Vermont is going up,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., directing the remark toward President Trump.
On Friday, Senate Republicans announced a new axe to clean energy: In the Trump administration’s budget overhaul called the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Senate suggested not only cutting federal funding for renewables but taxing those projects. 
The proposal would have penalized solar and wind projects if they sourced materials from countries the Trump administration has a strained relationship with , including China, which dominates the world in clean energy production and materials. The North America’s Building Trades Unions called it “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country” and equated it to “terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”
On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill, all but ensuring that Trump’s agenda will go into effect later this summer. But the tax was removed before Vice President J.D. Vance casted the tie-breaking vote as three GOP Senators – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Tim Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – broke with their party and voted against the bill.
The bill now moves for a vote in the House.  
“In Vermont and across the country, this bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices and move us in exactly the wrong direction in the fight against climate change,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told VTDigger in an email on Monday before the vote. “It will keep our country hooked on dirty and expensive fossil fuels by creating enormous new handouts for the very industry that is destroying the planet in pursuit of massive profits.”
Increasing frequency and severity of disasters have also taken the toll in Vermont: Since 1953, out of the 62 federally declared disasters in the state, half have occurred since 2011. 
The analysis of these disasters was included in the 2025 plan, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency tool that outlined those disasters was taken down by FEMA on June 30, the day before the report was published. Days earlier, the federal climate website, climate.gov, disappeared. 
The web address now redirects users to the climate webpage of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal government’s premier climate science agency currently facing severe staffing and funding cuts. The country’s sixth National Climate Assessment, which provides essential data for state and regional reports like this one, was shelved this spring when scientists were told to stop their work. 
With or without federal support, Vermont will begin its third Climate Action Plan in 2028, with a new publication planned for July 1, 2029. 
It recently became more difficult to understand what  the regional Northeast climate will be like at that time: The fifth National Climate Assessment, which was published in 2023, is no longer available on the federal website.

Greg Gianforte and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Shultz on Monday formalized a shared forest management agreement the governor said was the first of its kind between the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Calling it a “a model for collaborative landscape scale partnerships,” Schultz said the agreement establishes a new framework to “dramatically increase the pace and scale” of forest restoration, wildlife risk reduction and sustainable timber production across Montana’s national forests and adjacent land.
“Our forests are truly key to our Montana way of life, but this key part of our way of life is at risk. Over 60% of forested acres in our state are classified as being at high or very high risk of wildfire and insect infestations or both,” Gianforte said in remarks with Schultz near Helena that were posted online. “These risks threaten the health of our forests. They threaten our rural communities and our water supplies. It’s important that we work collaboratively to address these risks and make our forests healthy again.”
The new 20-year agreement with the Forest Service is the first of its kind in the nation, Gianforte said, and will implement a shared forest management vision across more than 200,000 acres of forested land in northwest Montana. 
According to the governor’s office, the new Shared Stewardship Agreement will leverage the EXPLORE Act and Good Neighbor Authority to streamline projects and reduce regulatory delays. Both the state and Forest Service said they’ll jointly select large-scale management projects. 
The EXPLORE Act is a bipartisan outdoor recreation package of legislation that passed Congress late last year and included specific provisions championed by Montana Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Ryan Zinke.
For more than a decade, the Good Neighbor Authority, authorized under the 2014 Farm Bill, has allowed the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to partner with federal agencies to manage and restore federal lands using state procedures, personnel and contracts. Given that 70% of Montana’s forested land is federally owned, the program has given Montana, and similar states in the West, more leeway in management decisions. 
Amanda Kaster, director of the DNRC, said that since the good neighbor agreement launched, the state has sold more than 100 million board feet of timber while helping safeguard Montana’s communities from wildfire threats. 
“Importantly, the revenue that is generated is reinvested into forest restoration, further reducing wildfire risk near our homes and our municipal watersheds,” Kaster said. “Over the next five years, we’re going to work on identifying and launching five to 10 site specific projects, to not only expand our good neighbor authority work into recreation infrastructure, but also strengthen wildfire resilience and community preparedness.”

Kaster said the first project is slated to begin this year, and the DNRC will be launching a public online dashboard that will track acres treated, board feet harvested and community safety improvements made through the new partnership. 
In a statement, Secretary of Agriculture Brook Rollins said the agreement is “exactly the kind of forward-leaning, state-driven leadership that President Trump and USDA have championed since day one. By cutting burdensome, unnecessary red tape and empowering Montana to lead, we’re proving that through real partnership, conservation and economic growth can go hand-in-hand.”
The shared stewardship agreement states that Montana’s forests are increasingly threatened by more frequent and severe wildfires, widespread insect and disease outbreaks and a “historic lack of active management” requiring a “new, integrated approach.”
By working together, the agencies aim to increase the pace and scale of restoration through coordinated planning and implementation; meet President Donald Trump’s goal of expanding domestic timber production through aggressive annual harvest targets; implement new and expanded categorical exclusions to streamline projects; continue to leverage state-federal partnerships through the Good Neighbor Authority; and increase the pace and scale of thinning and fuels reduction projects. 
The first project, expected to begin this year, is projected to cover a 200,000-acre swath of national forest land with a focus on marketable timber, according to the agreement. The agencies will sign a Good Neighbor Authority agreement for this first project by the end of the year. 
Following the start of that first project, the agencies will select two to four additional landscape-scale projects for feasibility assessments.  
In addition to the large-scale project, the agencies will also work on from five to 10 site-specific projects using streamlined permitting processes provided by the EXPLORE Act, with the first one initiated by the end of 2024. 
The agreement also outlines a commitment to an “annual sustainable volume” of timber harvest as much as 100 million board feet. 
“While our state has a tradition of partnership with the Forest Service, the state of Montana’s forest demands stronger action and closer cooperation,” Gianforte said. “… Together, we can actively manage our forests, reduce fire risk, support local jobs, improve habitat and expand recreational opportunities. And yes, we can make forests healthy again.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-02 18:09:26.887986
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 21:02:39+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal agency restores family-planning money to a Mississippi group,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/family-planning-money-restored/,"A federal agency has restored family-planning money to a nonprofit group in Mississippi, three months after suspending the money during a probe into diversity, equity and inclusion practices.","The nonprofit group that administers federal family planning money in Mississippi had its funding restored Wednesday, one month after it was forced to lay off half its staff and three months after its funding was withheld by the federal government.
Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely during an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
“We are relieved to have received our Notice of Award for Title X funding today, which enables us to return to the essential work of supporting our clinical network, maintaining operations, and meeting the needs of our communities across Mississippi and Tennessee,” Jamie Bardwell, co-executive director of Converge, said in a statement. 
The nonprofit will be rehiring some of the 10 staff it laid off, but is not currently able to rehire all due to “continued instability of federal funds,” Audrey Sandusky, vice president of communications and marketing at Converge, told Mississippi Today. 
The team received a letter from HHS on June 25 that the investigation found Converge to be compliant with the law and that funding would be restored. 
“OASH (Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health) reminds you of your ongoing obligation to comply with all terms of the award, including by not engaging in any unlawful diversity, equity or inclusion-related discrimination in violation of such laws,” the letter read. 
That same day, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, D-Canton, wrote a letter urging Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to push HHS to restore Converge’s funding. Blackmon wrote that the money supported services delivered through federally qualified health centers, which he called “lifelines in both rural and urban areas of our state.”

“The stakes for our communities could not be higher,” Blackmon wrote. “In 2024 alone, over 16,800 Mississippians, the majority of whom are uninsured and living at or below the federal poverty level, relied on Title X-supported services provided by Converge’s network.”
A spokesperson for Reeves did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s questions Wednesday about whether the governor advocated for the return of federal funding to Converge.
Blackmon has been a supporter of reproductive health care. Last session, he introduced a protest bill called the “Contraception Begins at Erection Act,” which would have made it unlawful for men to discharge genetic material without the intent to fertilize an embryo.

The state has enacted seven anti-ESG measures, not including resolutions, since 2021. Connor Gibson, one of the report’s authors, said the ESG label is nebulous, but often takes aim at climate goals, social justice initiatives and culture war targets. 
Much of the legislation that has moved through statehouses in the U.S. is based on model bills propagated by right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, he said. The bills often prohibit state entities from giving contracts to or investing in businesses proponents believe discriminate against firearm manufacturers or fossil fuel companies, for example.
 Pleiades head Frances Sawyer said in an interview that anti-ESG legislation prevents companies and fund managers from considering risk factors associated with a changing climate if they want to do business with state governments. 
“Climate economic shocks are here. Right-wing extremists, backed by the fossil fuel sector, have been working nonstop to undermine responsible investment practices in several states across the country under the framework of ‘anti-ESG’ legislation,” Sawyer said in a press release. 
“These policies are costly for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers, and it’s critically important that other states, investors, and companies hold the line amid rising climate costs and risks — and protect the right to respond to the climate crisis rationally.”
The climate advisory group’s 2025 Statehouse Report highlighted the anti-ESG trends in legislatures across the country. Arkansas was one of the most effective states in passing such laws, said Gibson. While some states, like Missouri and Arizona, have proposed dozens of anti-ESG bills only to pass one or none, most of the legislation that’s gone before Arkansas lawmakers ended up becoming law.
In 2025, “most of the 106 anti-ESG bills introduced in statehouses failed to advance, and only 9 have been signed by governors,” the report said. Two of those nine bills were passed in Arkansas. Two more bills are awaiting a governor’s signature in other states.
The 2025 numbers are down from 2023, which saw 165 bills introduced nationwide with 22 ultimately passing. Pleiades Strategy first began tracking anti-ESG bills in 2023.  
The targets of these bills are often the large capital funds managed by state governments, such as pension funds, and state contracting, Sawyer and Gibson said. The language often prevents state agencies or pension funds from contracting or investing with any company that boycotts fossil fuel companies, firearms companies or other industries. In the bills Arkansas has passed, there are exceptions for certain situations.
Sawyer said such bills can increase costs for governments by limiting the pool of businesses it can do business with.
Act 411 of 2023 was one such anti-ESG bill that made it into law in Arkansas, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, who said in a House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee meeting in February 2023 that it was designed “to make sure that we’re following our beliefs in the state and making sure that nobody’s discriminating against the industries that are important to Arkansas.” 
The law requires state investment funds to divest from firms that “discriminate” against certain industries, such as energy companies and firearm businesses, which are placed on a blacklist. Firms currently on the Arkansas blacklist are Goldman Sachs, TD Bank, Credit Suisse and others.
However, Arkansas became one of the only states to roll back a small part of its anti-ESG legislation in 2025 when it passed Act 252 of 2025. The new law broadened a clause in Act 411 to allow any public entity subject to the law to avoid divesting from blacklisted firms if the divestment would result in a negative financial impact.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/money-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, speaks at a press conference on protecting public lands alongside   U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, May 28, 2025, at the Lake Estes Marina. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats railed against the Republican-led spending cut and tax break package on Wednesday morning as the U.S. House of Representatives inches toward a vote on its final passage.
The bill, which has a Friday deadline imposed by President Donald Trump, would make permanent 2017 tax cuts and slash over $1 trillion in federal funding over a decade for safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs. It would fulfill a bulk of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, including boosting spending for defense and border security.
But Democrats say it is a transfer of wealth from struggling Americans to the wealthy.
“It really is a travesty of any kind of common sense. We’re the wealthiest country on Earth, and we spent the last several days arguing with Republicans over whether 17 million Americans deserve to have health care. I thought we’d gotten past that,” Sen. John Hickenlooper told reporters during a Wednesday morning press conference.
Colorado’s four Democratic representatives voted against the bill when it initially went through the House in May, and the state’s four GOP House members voted in favor of it. On Tuesday, Colorado’s Democratic U.S. senators voted against it.
The House is expected to consider the Senate’s version of the bill sometime on Wednesday.
“This will clearly exacerbate and turbo charge a poverty crisis in our country by virtue of the cruel cuts that have been included in the bill that Republicans are attempting to shove through here over the course of the next several hours,” said Rep. Joe Neguse, a Boulder Democrat. “We’re going to use every procedural tool that we can to try to stop and block this bill from proceeding.”
The Medicaid provisions in the bill, which include new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, could put health coverage at risk for nearly 200,000 Coloradans, Hickenlooper said. That estimate ranges from about 150,000 to 250,000. A recent analysis from the state’s Office of State Planning and Budget predicts a loss of $1 billion in health care funding due to the bill, and state budget writers warn that Colorado could not absorb the loss.

Hickenlooper and others said they specifically want to see an exemption in the bill for rural health care centers, clinics and hospitals. He noted a handful of Colorado hospitals that are already labeled as high risk for closure.
“It’s going to take a trillion dollars out of the health care system,” said Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who represents Colorado’s 6th Congressional District. “Even if folks are saying ‘I’m not on Medicaid. Why does this impact me? I have the Cadillac program through my employer. What difference will this make?’ You can’t take a trillion dollars out of the American health care system and not have hospital closures, clinic closures, doctors and nurses leaving the system.”
There is some money set aside in the bill to partially compensate rural hospitals.
Mitzi Moran, the CEO of Sunrise Community Health in Greeley, said that the bill could put 11,000, or about one-quarter, of their patients at risk of losing coverage.
Joe Theine, the CEO of Southwest Health System in Cortez, said that about 25% of their total cash comes from Medicaid, including $9 million through provider taxes that enable Colorado to claim more federal money. Southwest Health System is one of the only critical-access hospitals in the region and delivers primary care to nearly 9,000 people in those counties.
Democratic leaders also denounced the bill’s cuts to nutrition programs and reduction in clean energy infrastructure investments.
“This was a major step toward addressing climate change, and now it’s like running into a brick wall,” Hickenlooper said.
On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the state Legislature wrote to Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress urging them to vote against the bill. In addition to highlighting the risk to Medicaid and nutrition spending, they warned of the potential need to reduce funding for the state’s Department of Corrections, increase higher education tuition, limit the senior and veteran homestead exemption for property taxes, and cut state tax credits for families.
“While we understand that you do not need to balance the federal budget — as demonstrated by your votes for this bill that will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars — we do balance our budgets in Colorado,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, Majority Leader Monica Duran, Rep. Emily Sirota and Rep. Shannon Bird wrote.
“We have had to make hard choices in the last year to protect core services for hardworking families, and we will have to make many more in the year ahead. However, the choices this bill will force us to make are far worse and will be devastating for our state. Vote no.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Wednesday she will not run for governor in 2026 — an unexpected decision for some Iowans who thought she would be a top Republican contender in the race to fill Gov. Kim Reynolds’ seat.
Shortly after Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection following her current term, Bird released a statement saying she and her husband would “pray and consider what this decision means for our future.”
Bird was considered a high-profile potential pick for the GOP gubernatorial nominee, having strong ties to President Donald Trump from his time in the state during the Iowa caucuses. Trump told Iowans in January 2024 that Bird will “be your governor someday, I predict.” She posted a video on X in May, featuring this comment, alongside other clips of Trump praising the Iowa AG, with the caption “Someday…”
But on Wednesday, Bird officially ruled out a bid for governor in the 2026 election, instead saying she plans to run for reelection as attorney general.
“I am absolutely determined to do justice and hold this office to prevent it from being occupied by a radical, progressive Democrat who would undo all we’ve accomplished,” Bird said in a statement. “… Between now and next November, I will run a fierce reelection campaign, and I will will.”
During her time since taking office after the 2022 election when she defeated longtime former Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, Bird said her office has accomplished “big victories” on issues like supporting crime victims and law enforcement and defending constitutional rights.
As she plans to run again as AG, she thanked people who encouraged her to run for governor, and said she plans to work to elect Republicans in 2026.
“I will also enthusiastically support our Republican nominee for Governor and the entire Republican ticket here in Iowa — our party will be unified,” Bird said. “I remain grateful for the opportunity to serve Iowans as their Attorney General, and I look forward to earning their support again.”
Bird is not the only Republican potential gubernatorial candidate who has tapped out of the race. Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley announced in late June he will run again for the Iowa House after earlier indicating he was not ruling out a gubernatorial bid. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig also said in May he will not run for governor but instead run again as agriculture secretary.
There are still several Republicans who are moving forward with gubernatorial runs. Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, have launched “exploratory” committees for a gubernatorial run.
Bousselot released a statement Wednesday applauding Bird’s work in the AG’s office and saying he supported her decision to run again for the position. He also said Iowa Republicans need a full ticket in 2026 that will “fight aggressively for an Iowa First Agenda that complements President Trump’s America First Agenda.”
“I have been proud to fight for that agenda in the Legislature – lower taxes, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Iowa, and standing firm against extremists who want to raise our taxes so the government can spend more, allow men in girls sports, and who don’t support border policies that keep our communities safe,” Bousselot said. “I have been sharing my perspective with voters around the state, listening to feedback from Iowans, and am laying the groundwork for a potential campaign for Governor next year.”
Democrats including Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and former political operative Julie Stauch have also launched 2026 campaigns for governor.
There is also a Democrat who has announced plans to run for attorney general in 2026. Nate Willems, a lawyer and former state representative, launched his campaign for attorney general in May. Willems released a statement Wednesday saying Iowans are ready to remove Bird from the AG’s office in the upcoming election.
“Iowans are tired of watching Brenna Bird dismantle the integrity of this office and turn it into a mouthpiece for an extreme political agenda,” Willems said in a statement. “Instead of protecting Iowans she has come after our most vulnerable neighbors, including children with disabilities, senior citizens, and sexual assault survivors, all to build her own national profile. It’s time to turn the page and get the attorney general’s office focused on helping the people of Iowa.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/birdabortion1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, who secured a settlement with the city and the state in 2017 to replace all of Flint’s lead lines, acknowledged that more than eight years later, the state had replaced nearly 11,000 pipes and restored more than 28,000 properties. 
In 2014, the city switched its water supply from water piped in from Detroit to the Flint River, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. Due to inadequate treatment of the water, corroding pipes leached lead into thousands of homes as residents raised concerns about discolored, foul-smelling and tasting water.
Bonsitu Kitaba, the interim legal director of the ACLU of Michigan, who worked with the city council to secure the settlement, credited the citizens of Flint for Tuesday’s milestone, emphasizing the efforts residents made to ensure the city and the state fulfilled their obligations.
“Residents of Flint deserve – and have always deserved – access to clean, safe drinking water and property repairs, full stop. While we know that this is not a resolution for all the harms caused to the people of Flint from the water crisis, we celebrate this long-awaited win alongside you. We are committed to our partnership and the work ahead,” Kitaba said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the initial deadline for the settlement was set for 2020, Flint residents repeatedly found themselves back in court, with federal judge David M. Lawson in 2024 declaring Flint in contempt of a previous court order requiring the city to hit certain milestones in replacing lead pipes. 
However, the state’s final progress report does not mark the end of the city’s obligations, as several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes and some residents have declined to have their pipes tested or replaced. 
During a celebration in May marking the completion of the program, Kitaba noted that the city is still required to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Flint has also committed to replacing any remaining lead lines this year, with Kitaba encouraging residents with lead lines to call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.
The council stressed there is no safe level of lead exposure. 
Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors for Social Action cheered his fellow community members, crediting their work to hold elected leaders accountable as the reason behind Tuesday’s milestone.
“Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, we are finally at the end of the lead pipe replacement project. While this milestone is not all the justice our community deserves, it is a huge achievement,” Overton said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lead-pipes-enviromental-justice.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr picked South Dakota as the place to unveil what he called a “Build America Agenda,” aimed at cutting regulations and revitalizing the telecommunications industry.
Carr delivered a speech Wednesday at the wireless infrastructure construction company VIKOR, surrounded by construction workers, American flags and Toby Keith country music playing from loudspeakers.
Before the event, Carr climbed a 200-foot KELO-TV tower. At the event, he wore and handed out red hats emblazoned with the slogan “Make Towers Great Again,” similar to hats at President Donald Trump’s political rallies that say “Make America Great Again.” 
Inflation drives up cost of broadband internet projects

South Dakota, Carr said, symbolizes what’s possible when “we get our regulatory policies right.”
“I imagine that the ‘other S.F.’ — San Francisco — might seem like a more natural pick to most when outlining a tech or telecom agenda,” Carr said. “But I can’t think of a more appropriate place for me to announce the agenda that will guide much of the FCC’s upcoming work than right here in the real S.F.”
Carr was originally nominated to the FCC by Trump in 2017, and then renominated by President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate both times. This year, Trump picked Carr to serve as FCC chairman.
 Prior to Trump’s election win last year, Carr authored a chapter about the FCC in the controversial Project 2025 report, a policy roadmap for a second Trump term published by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
On Wednesday, Carr praised Trump’s second-term priorities and Republican leadership in South Dakota, including Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Carr previously joined Thune to visit a broadband internet construction site in Colton in June 2023, spotlighting the value of federal investments in internet infrastructure.



Speech highlights
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr announced several goals of his Build America Agenda, including:

Accelerating the shift from aging copper lines to high-speed internet.
Encouraging greater collaboration and more concrete timelines to fix “slow, cumbersome” delays when telecom crews are stringing new fiber-optic lines across utility poles.
Using legal powers to override local siting delays and permit faster infrastructure deployment.
Revisiting how the FCC complies with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), in light of recent Supreme Court rulings relaxing requirements for environmental review.
Selling off unused airwaves that companies can use to build new wireless networks. 
Eliminating rules slowing the space satellite industry, to “inject rocket fuel into our licensing process by standardizing our reviews through more objective metrics.”
Eliminating decades-old rules governing outdated technologies like telegraphs and phone booths.
Implementing workforce reforms aimed at “making it harder for foreign, fly-by-night crews to sweep in and undercut the safety and security of our networks.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) is asking a state court to block an attempt by a fired firefighter who leads the union representing workers at T.F. Green International Airport to get his job back — a move that appeared to catch him by surprise.
Airport officials filed a lawsuit against Steven Parent on Wednesday in Providence County Superior Court, citing allegations he trespassed into the T.F. Green fire station on Nov. 1, 2024, four days after being fired.
Parent, who worked at T.F. Green for more than a decade, has been president of Local 2873 of RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) since 2019. The union represents airport police officers, firefighters, airfield maintenance, building maintenance, operations and clerical staff.
An arbitration hearing on an unfair labor practice Parent filed against RIAC is scheduled for some time in August after being delayed twice. He is seeking reinstatement as a fire lieutenant after being fired on Oct. 28 after airport officials claimed he discouraged people from applying for jobs at the Warwick airport while benefiting from overtime pay caused by ongoing vacancies. Upon his termination, airport officials immediately revoked Parent’s security credentials and informed him he was no longer permitted in secure areas of the airport.
The legal action was news to Parent when reached for comment by phone Wednesday morning. He said he had yet to be served any papers.
“They’re suing me?” he said. “I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.”
RIAC claims Parent never returned his deactivated badge as required under the federal government’s Airport Security Program.
Four days after his firing, Parent entered the airport’s fire station — which RIAC claims is a secured area — without an escort. 
“Mr. Parent’s unauthorized access caused alarm among airport employees,” the lawsuit claims.
The fire station is located opposite the airfield, and has a gated entrance along Cedar Swamp Road in Warwick near Winslow Park.
According to airport officials, Parent used an intercom to ask the on-duty firefighter — one of his former subordinates to open the gate remotely for him, the lawsuit states. Parent was reportedly confronted by the airport’s deputy fire chief and told to leave, but Parent allegedly flipped him off.
Parent denied his interaction was uncivil and said he had called the station ahead of his arrival.
“I had no issue with the deputy chief — I wasn’t being disciplined for anything at the fire station,” Parent said.
Deputy Fire Chief Justin Vail deferred comment to RIAC.

Airport officials said Parent took work material without authorization following his firing. Parent said he retrieved a copy of the union’s contract. At the time union officials and RIAC were in the midst of negotiating a new contract for airport workers, which was eventually ratified in March 2025.
“RIAC’s filing speaks for itself,” Duc Nguyen, the airport’s senior vice president of operations,  said in a statement. “This action is to confirm RIAC’s authority to determine eligibility for security credentials consistent with federal requirements and its duty to ensure the safety and security of the airport and traveling public.”
Council 94 President Michael McDonald said he too was caught by surprise by the filing, but that legal action was not totally unexpected. He called the lawsuit a last resort by airport officials to avoid arbitration with Parent over an unfair labor practice, which is scheduled to happen some time in August.
“They’re trying to avoid answering for what they’ve done,” McDonald said in an interview. 
Parent said arbitration was first scheduled for February, but was delayed to June and is now pushed to August.










They’re suing me? I was not aware of any of this — I was just there Monday.


– Steven Parent, fired airport fire lieutenant and president of Local 2873 of RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees


But a statement issued by RIAC Wednesday claims the arbitration process is limited to addressing whether Parent was wrongfully terminated, not to resolve any legal nuances. The lawsuit argues that even if Parent were reinstated, his alleged security breach would prevent him from regaining clearance, making him ineligible to serve at the fire station.
If the court blocks Parent’s reinstatement, RIAC argues that airport officials can move forward with filling his vacant lieutenant position. The position is not posted on RIAC’s job portal. But Parent said two candidates have already applied and recently took written tests for the role — tests he observed.
“I pretty much encouraged everyone there to apply,” he said.
RIAC is asking the court to uphold officials’ decision to revoke Parent’s credentials.
McDonald said the union will continue to fight for Parent as the legal process plays out.
“We’ll stop at nothing to defend Steve, he’s our local president — as we would for any member of Rhode Island Council 94 who’s been treated in this manner,” McDonald said. “We are confident that once this all settles, we will prevail.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico health officials confirmed an additional eight cases of measles in the Luna County Detention Center Wednesday, bringing the total to 13 — 12 people in the jail and one staff member.
Last week, five detainees tested positive for measles, but an additional eight people displayed symptoms, New Mexico Department of Health Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source NM. Two more cases are pending.
The latest case was reported in Luna County on June 26, 2025, and Smelser said lags may occur between determining cases and publicly confirming them.
“We focus on disease control first, trying to prevent the spread of the infection, so we might be a little slower in our communication,” he said.
NMDOH offered vaccinations for 400 detainees and nearly 100 staff, and provided “more than 100 vaccines” in the last week, Smelser said, noting jail officials’ “incredible cooperation” in working to prevent further spread.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
All 12 people exposed to measles were placed in a designated pod and quarantined until several days after symptoms faded, according to Pablo Montoya, the director of public safety at the detention center. Currently, two people remain quarantined.
Staff were given masks, gloves and gowns to prevent spread, Montoya said. The facility does not staff to be vaccinated, he said.
In total, New Mexico has recorded 94 cases of measles in eight counties since the mid-February outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, first crossed the state line, with cases in Lea, San Juan, Curry, Eddy, Doña Ana, Chaves and Sandoval counties.

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A federal appeals court has ruled against a Florida teacher who challenged a state law forbidding transgender teachers from using their preferred pronouns during their official duties in the classroom.
The case involves Katie Wood, a math teacher in Hillsborough County who is transgender. She sued the state after a 2023 law passed saying that employees of public schools may not identify to their students with pronouns not consistent with their birth sex, “an immutable biological trait.”
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Wood. The majority considered whether her speech or pronoun use while interacting with students inside the classroom is private speech or within the scope of employment.
“Given the statute’s relatively limited sweep and, even more so, the narrowness of Wood’s challenge, this is, we think, a straightforward case,” Judge Kevin Newsom wrote in a 14-page opinion. “When a public-school teacher addresses her students within the four walls of a classroom — whether orally or in writing — she is unquestionably acting ‘pursuant to [her] official duties.'”
Wood argued the law violated her First Amendment rights and that use of he/him pronouns would induce emotional harm, risk physical harm, and disrupt the classroom, while avoiding titles and pronouns would be “impractical, disruptive, and stigmatizing.”
District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, appointed by former President Barack Obama, had ruled at trial that it was “substantially likely” the law violated Wood’s speech rights and issued a preliminary injunction.  
Transgender teachers get a court date in challenge to FL’s misgendering law

The appeal court vacated that injunction. 
The majority found that Wood was acting as teacher, rather than as a private citizen, when writing her pronouns on the whiteboard and syllabi, wearing a pin with her pronouns, and providing her pronouns verbally. 
“We hold that the district court misapplied the law, and thus abused its discretion, in preliminarily enjoining [the law’s] enforcement against Wood. We therefore vacate the district court’s order and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion,” Newsom wrote. 
The 2023 law was among bills expanding the Parental Rights in Education Act, also known as “Don’t Say Gay,” from the year before. The bills aim to restrict mention of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.
“And because Wood can’t show a likelihood of success on her First Amendment claim, we needn’t address any of the remaining preliminary-injunction factors,” Newsom wrote.

Dissent
In a dissenting opinion, Judge Adalberto Jordan wrote that pronouns and personal titles for a teacher are, “like her name, significant markers of individual identity.”
“They exist outside of, and do not depend on, the school or the government for their existence. Stated differently, Ms. Wood would still have her own preferred personal title and pronouns, and would still use them to identify herself to others, even if she was not a public school teacher,” Jordan wrote. 
It’s not clear that the First Amendment claim brought by Woods should fail, Jordan said. 
“We should be wary of holding that everything that happens in a classroom constitutes government speech outside the ambit of the First Amendment,” Jordan wrote. “Those who wield the power of the government today and are on one side of the gender and culture wars will be the ones at risk of being compelled to speak against their beliefs, or silenced, when their opponents are in charge. Today’s opinion will then not look as attractive.”
Jordan doubted, as did the trial court, that high school students “would view her preferred personal title and pronouns as Florida’s endorsement of her being transgender.”
Jordan was appointed by Obama, and Newsom was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, as was Judge Andrew Brasher, who sided with Newsom.

The department announced the settlement with Villa Financial Services LLC and Villa Olympia Investment LLC on Wednesday. The facilities in question include Villa’s Ambassador, Father Murray, Imperial, Regency, St. Joseph’s and Westland locations.
Villa has denied the allegations but agreed to the settlement announced Wednesday.
“Chronic neglect of nursing home residents is absolutely unacceptable, yet sadly all too common,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement.  “American taxpayers contribute billions every year to ensure quality care for our most vulnerable. When that care is not provided, my office will continue to work alongside our federal partners to hold those responsible accountable.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Villa will pay $3.41 million to the U.S. government as part of the settlement and $1.08 million to the state of Michigan, the department said.
The department’s Health Care Fraud Division handled the case, which is a federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for the state, which received 75% of its funding from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant of $5.7 million in 2025. The investigation also included involvement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.
A whistleblower complaint from Villa employees jumpstarted the inquiry, as employees claimed they personally witnessed the mistreatment of residents. It was alleged that the nursing homes failed to sufficiently staff the facilities, prevent and treat infections, prevent falls, and failed to provide toileting needs that resulted in residents sitting in or laying in soiled beds or clothes for long periods of time.
The facilities also failed to prevent pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores.
Villa must also enter into a five-year quality-of-care Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. DHHS and its Office of Inspector General. The agreement requires the companies to retain an independent quality monitor to review their provision of care and their ability to detect and respond to patient care issues.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1358903157-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

ARTICLE SUMMARY:

Illinois closed fiscal year 2025 with record $54 billion in revenue.
While that marked a surplus from the enacted budget, the extra revenue was anticipated when lawmakers approved the current-year budget in May.
It doesn’t give lawmakers any extra breathing room for an expected volatile fiscal year 2026.



Despite uncertainty over the economy and federal funding during the second half of fiscal year 2025, the year closed on June 30 with the state setting a new record for annual revenue.

Numbers compiled by the independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability show FY25 concluded with $54 billion in revenue, the most the state has ever received in a fiscal year. The state also brought in $717 million more in revenue than lawmakers originally budgeted for when they passed a $53.3 billion budget in May 2024.

All told, the final revenue numbers track closely with projections made in May by both COGFA and the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget that formed the basis of the FY26 budget. In other words, June revenues produced no surprises, and lawmakers aren’t sitting on any substantial surplus as the new fiscal year begins.

The record revenues also don’t alleviate any uncertainty for the current or future fiscal years as Congress considers drastic reductions to the social safety net and aid to states.

Causes of revenue growth

Strong personal income tax growth drove the revenue increase in FY25, largely thanks to a “true up” conducted by the Department of Revenue that reallocated business related income tax revenue into the personal income tax category. Personal income tax revenue was 10% higher than in FY24, but corporate income taxes declined by 9.5%.

Some other revenue sources also saw minimal growth. Sales tax revenue grew by less than 1%, though COGFA noted it increased by nearly 3% in the second half of FY25 after a weak start last summer as gas prices dropped and people cut back on large purchases amid growing economic uncertainty.

Federal income was also down 4.6% in FY25, even when excluding one-time pandemic relief funds the state received in FY24. But in a bright spot for the state, COGFA found that state revenue sources grew more than anticipated to offset the $178 million decline in federal revenue.

Despite solid revenue growth this year, questions remain about how well it will perform in FY26.

“Whether this record will be surpassed in FY 2026 remains to be seen, though the FY 2026 enacted budget assumes revenues of $55.297 billion – nearly $1.3 billion above the FY 2025 final total,” COGFA Revenue Manger Eric Noggle wrote.

Bills paid and money left over

The state also ended the fiscal year with $1.9 billion of cash in the General Revenue Fund after all bills were paid, according to the Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office.

“We work hard each year to pay bills on time, build up the state’s emergency reserves and stress fiscal discipline, even in these uncertain times,” Mendoza said in a statement. “My office will strive for continued improvement in state finances and credit ratings in the new budget year.”

Mendoza's office also put $256 million into the “rainy day” fund, growing it to a balance of $2.5 billion. The fund is expected to grow at a slower rate in FY26, however, as lawmakers suspended a monthly transfer that will free up $45 million.

With an extra cash balance to start the new fiscal year, Mendoza said she plans to pre-pay monthly pension payments for FY26. Lawmakers gave the comptroller authority last year to make pension payments earlier in the year rather than on a monthly basis when extra money is available.

“This will enable the systems to plan accordingly and keep additional dollars in their investment portfolios into the new budget year,” Mendoza said.

An uncertain future

With good new concluding FY25, attention now turns to FY26, which began Tuesday, and the vast uncertainty the state faces from budget talks in Congress and the economic fallout of decisions by the Trump administration.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a $55.1 billion spending plan in mid-June that relies on $55.3 billion in revenue. It’s the largest budget in state history despite minimal discretionary spending growth, and it relies on $1.2 billion of tax increases or one-time revenues.

But state lawmakers have left the door open to the possibility that changes Congress makes to federal funding that requires states to cover greater portions of government programs and ceases funding in certain areas will require lawmakers to change the budget.

“The ability of the state to try to step in and try to mitigate the damage is somewhat limited, although we have the ability to do certain things and may have to in special session or we may have to in veto session,” Pritzker told reporters in Peoria on Tuesday. “It’s a little hard to tell yet. Some of the provisions of this terrible bill in Washington, D.C. don’t go into effect until next year and so we’ll have to evaluate what changes to make in order to deal with it.”

Work requirements for health care and food assistance programs, cuts to Medicaid reimbursements and the elimination of clean energy tax credits could all require the state to take on more costs.

,DC,2025-07-02 20:27:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump dealt loss as judge rejects executive order claiming 'invasion' at the border,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-dealt-loss-judge-rejects-executive-order-claiming-invasion-border,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge Wednesday ruled as unlawful an executive order by President Donald Trump that barred asylum by claiming an “invasion” at the southern border and the need to protect states.It’s the first major blow to the Trump administration in its attempt to end the ability for asylum seekers to make asylum claims.“The President cannot adopt an alternative immigration system, which supplants the statutes that Congress has enacted,” District of Columbia U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote in his opinion.“Here, nothing in the (Immigration and Nationality Act) or the Constitution grants the President or his delegees the sweeping authority asserted in the Proclamation and implementing guidance,” continued Moss, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.The order from Moss also prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from enforcing the executive order.He also agreed to certify a class for potential asylum-seekers, which comes after last week's Supreme Court ruling that curtailed nationwide injunctions from lower courts. Certifying a class was suggested by the court to give judges an avenue to make an order broader.Moss put his order on hold for 14 days, to give the Trump administration time to appeal his ruling. If the order is upheld by an appeals court and the Supreme Court, it would require the Trump administration to begin processing asylum applicants for migrants.“(The executive order) is unlawful insofar as it purports to suspend or to restrict access to asylum, withholding of removal, or the existing regulatory processes for obtaining (Convention Against Torture) protection,” Moss wrote in his order.Inauguration DayThe asylum order was one of several immigration-related executive orders that Trump signed on the Inauguration Day of his second term. The order proclaimed that the “current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion” and barred asylum-seekers from being able to claim asylum.Trump characterized asylum-seekers seeking entry at the U.S.-Mexico border as an “invasion” and said that the states need “protection,” so the White House would suspend physical entry until the president deemed the “invasion” over.Encounters at the southern border have been the lowest in several years.The section Trump cited in his proclamation, section 212(f), is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under that section, the president has the authority to “suspend the entry” of people who are not U.S. citizens under certain circumstances.Complaint filed in FebruaryThe suit from the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal organizations, on behalf of Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, and other immigration legal service providers, argued the executive order unlawfully denies asylum and other humanitarian protections that are ""expressly granted by Congress.""“It is returning asylum seekers—not just single adults, but families too—to countries where they face persecution or torture, without allowing them to invoke the protections Congress has provided,” according to the initial complaint filed in February. “Indeed, the Proclamation does not even exempt unaccompanied children, despite the specific protections such children receive by statute.”RAICES, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Florence Immigrant And Refugee Rights Project, which provide legal services to immigrants, argued that the proclamation harms the legal aid work of the individual plaintiffs.Those individual plaintiffs in the suit include people who allege they fled persecution in Afghanistan, Ecuador, Cuba, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey and Peru. Some plaintiffs have either been removed to their home country, or to a third country such as Panama, according to the filing.",,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Idaho will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended to 1990.

 U.S. senators put support behind RECA reauthorization

RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a press release that he negotiated the inclusion of Idaho victims in the final language of the bill.
“Many Idahoans have died or suffered as a result of cancer related to fallout from 1950s to 1960s Cold War-era above-ground nuclear weapons testing with no recompense,” Crapo said in the release. “Idahoans have been unfairly left out of the RECA program for far too many years. The Senate’s passage of language to include Idaho in the program marks one step closer to ensuring affected Idahoans will finally start to receive the compensation they rightfully deserve. I urge the U.S. House of Representatives to preserve this provision.”
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

Last year, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján teamed up with Hawley to sponsor a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
In mid-June, when Hawley re-introduced the measure into the GOP budget bill, the delegation responded by noting, in part, that the measure has previously garnered bipartisan support.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, also noted in a statement provided to Source that over the years of fighting for RECA, the state’s delegation and the advocates have “built a broad coalition grounded in justice and science, yet Republican leadership refused to pass our bill and the program lapsed last year. Since then, people have been dying while Republican leadership in the House drags its feet. However, even a broken clock is right twice a day. While the broader Billionaires Budget Bill is deeply harmful in many ways, we are glad some Republicans are finally recognizing the value of RECA. New Mexicans have waited long enough. They deserve the compensation and recognition they’ve earned through pain and sacrifice.”
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.
Correction: A previous version reported uranium workers in South Dakota, North Dakota, Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Texas were not covered under RECA. While these states were not covered in the initial version of the bill, it was expanded in 2000 to included these states.

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s latest scholarship program for K-12 private tuition and other expenses reached its cap of 10,000 students for the year, according to the state Department of Education.
That’s more than triple the number enrolled last year, when just under half of the initial program’s 5,000 slots went unfilled even before classes started.
And of those 2,880 students accepted, as many as 1,000 were removed after payments went out for failing to meet eligibility requirements, according to estimates from the Education Oversight Committee.
But under the law signed in May, income eligibility expanded for the coming school year. Families’ qualifying income can reach up to 300% of the federal poverty level this school year, instead of 200%. For a family of four, for example, incomes max out at $96,450, up from $62,400.
That opened the door for a greater number of students to receive the $7,500 annual scholarships, doled out in four quarterly payments that start this month.
“This is an exciting milestone in South Carolina’s education freedom journey,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “This program puts hardworking families in the driver’s seat — empowering them to shape an education as unique as their child.”

The 10,000 students enrolled for 2025-26 include 1,691 students who participated in the program last year.
The department did not provide a breakdown of student demographics, such as age, race and geographic location, or the reasons applications were rejected.
So far, applications for 16,119 students were submitted; 2,819 of them were rejected, and 4,991 applications remain under review, said agency spokesman Jason Raven.
If they’re found eligible, those students will be put on a waitlist to either take over any spots that open up this year or be among the first to get dibs when the application window opens again next year — when eligibility expands again.
Under the law, up to 15,000 students qualify for 2026-27, when parents’ incomes don’t cap out until reaching 500% of the federal poverty line. That’s $161,000 for a family of four under the latest guidelines (which are adjusted annually).
If more than 15,000 students apply, legislators have the option of funding additional scholarships by putting more money in the state budget.
This year’s increase in students accepted has several possible explanations, Raven said.
For one, legislators did away with the deadline to apply, which was the primary reason the department rejected applications last year. Nearly 80% of the 5,027 applications rejected ahead of the 2024-2025 school year were because parents missed the deadline or failed to complete all the necessary paperwork, the department said at the time.
Palmetto Promise Institute, which spent years lobbying for the school choice program, also redoubled its efforts to help parents sign up, offering a webinar explaining the program as well as one-on-one support for parents with questions, said Felicity Ropp, who leads the conservative think tank’s information hub on school choice.
Another likely reason for the increase, Raven said, was a renewed spotlight on the program as the House and Senate debated and ultimately passed a law meant to get private schools back on the list of providers after the state Supreme Court’s ruling last September.
In a split decision, justices said K-12 private tuition payments violated the state constitution’s ban on taxpayer money directly benefiting private education, requiring private schools to be immediately removed from the list of providers eligible for scholarship money. GOP legislators designed the new law to get around that ban.
Another potential explanation for the increase is a new provision allowing families already using open enrollment programs at traditional public schools to participate, said Patrick Kelly with the Palmetto State Teachers Association. Students attending a school other than the one for which they are zoned, including a different public school, can use the money for various expenses including tutoring, textbooks and computers.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

How many of the enrolled students can use their scholarship for private tuition in the coming school year remains to be seen.
The state’s high court will ultimately decide whether tuition payments under the new law are constitutional, as another lawsuit is expected ahead of classes starting.
The compromise that Republicans in both chambers agreed to combined parts of the House and Senate versions of the legislation. Following the Senate’s suggestion, legislators used lottery revenue to cover $20 million of the $75 million the program will need this year. Keeping with the House’s proposal, the law requires Weaver to hire a “trustee” to oversee fund distribution, which will begin at the end of the month.
Supporters of the program said the cap being hit showed a high demand for the payments.
“These robust application numbers show how excited South Carolina parents are to have opportunity and choice in their children’s education,” Ropp said.
Critics remain unconvinced.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, called the law a “blatant disregard for our constitution by those who are sworn to uphold it.”
“Funds that could be used for other state agencies are being diverted to private schools that pick and choose who they educate,” East said in a statement. “If they take state money, they should play by the same rules.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/school-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 17:08:06.719942

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)With roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding at stake, Congress is racing to finalize a sweeping budget package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” ahead of President Donald Trump’s July 4 deadline — but key decisions about cuts to the health care program remain up in the air.
A preliminary review by the Congressional Budget Office has heightened concern, and a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers and hospital associations across several states is warning against adopting the Senate version of the bill, which they say could devastate Medicaid-dependent health systems.
The overall package, which calls for cuts to several federal social aid programs, is meant to extend overall tax cuts from Trump’s first presidential term, while boosting U.S. border and military spending. 
Although the House already passed its version in June, the Senate version only advanced this week after Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote, following opposition from three Republican senators who sided with Democrats. 
A central dispute between the two chambers involves how the Senate version would restructure Medicaid funding, particularly in ways that could undercut Virginia’s hospitals and the state’s expanded Medicaid program. 
“Given the available options, the U.S. House reconciliation legislation is the better approach to accomplish the President’s tax-cutting objectives while still preserving our health care delivery system and health safety net,” wrote Julian Walker, vice president of communications for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. “For the sake of public health, well-being, and the economy, we urge members of the House to reject the Senate plan and insist on their version of the package.”
He added that the association is “deeply disturbed” by the Senate version. 
Last week, Virginia joined hospital associations in 13 states in signing a joint letter opposing the Senate’s proposal. Walker has previously warned that rural hospitals would be hit hardest, likely forced into closures or deep cuts into service and staffing. 
While the House version avoids the same blow to hospital funding mechanisms, it still has Medicaid changes that Democrats, healthcare advocates and many Virginians have criticized. 
Both versions of the bill include new work and authorization requirements for Medicaid recipients.Though most Medicaid beneficiaries already work, some rely on it when temporarily unable to do so — such as Richmond-area construction worker Andrew Daughtry, who is recovering from an injury, and the daughter of Aida Pachecho, who is unemployed while battling breast cancer. 
U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said during a recent press call that the additional authorization requirements could overwhelm already burdened government employees. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia introduced amendments to protect Medicaid before the Senate bill passed, but those efforts fell short. 
Despite concerns, Virginia’s House Republicans continue to back their chamber’s version of the bill, claiming it meets Trump’s goals without gutting Medicaid. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, signed onto a joint letter with other lawmakers last week. 
“The House’s approach reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard, and we urge that it be retained in the final bill,” they wrote. “Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers.”
Medicaid’s size as a share of the federal budget has made it a prime target for Republicans looking to trim or redirect spending. Wittman and Kiggans argue the reforms will ultimately strengthen coverage for pregnant people, children and disabled Americans.

In a recent newsletter, Kiggans called the bill “historic,” describing it as a tool to “rein in Washington’s waste” and deliver on promises made by Trump and Congressional Republicans.
Wittman, who has spoken about being adopted thanks to Medicaid coverage at birth, emphasized his personal connection to the program.
“I know firsthand what access to care means for families like mine,” he said in a recent statement. 
But Virginia Democrats argue that Wittman and Kiggans have already done damage by supporting even partial cuts. 
Democratic Party of Virginia chair Lamont Bagby said in a recent statement that the two representatives “already broke their promise to Virginians by voting to advance this disastrous budget that makes the largest cuts to Medicaid in history.”
He questioned whether the two Republicans would “once again bend the knee to Trump” or stand with their constituents.

The GR2 Foundation: Grambling Research and Resource Foundation is a nonprofit entity separate from Grambling State that will support the university’s academics through philanthropic fundraising. Many other universities already work with similar foundations for this. 
“GR2 is the engine behind our next chapter,” said Grambling President Martin Lemelle. “As we rise toward R2 status, we are laying the groundwork for a stronger, smarter, and more sustainable Grambling State.” 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutes of Higher Education recognizes three levels of research institutions: “R1” or “R2,” meaning they are doctoral degree-granting institutions with either “very high” or “high” levels of research activity and “Research Colleges and Universities,” which goes to schools who spend at least $2.5 million annually on research, regardless of whether they confer doctoral degrees. 
To obtain R2 status, Grambling will need to spend $5 million annually on research and confer at least 20 doctorate degrees. 
Research spending at Grambling has decreased every year since 2017, when it spent $5.9 million on research. In 2023, the most recent year in which data is available, Grambling spent less than $500,000 on research, and does not presently have a research ranking. 
Grambling has recently secured over $12 million in research funding, according to a university press release, including $7 million from the National Science Foundation. 
Theodore Callier, Grambling’s vice president for research, said launching the foundation will allow the university to scale its success in securing external funding. 
Louisiana’s other R2 institutions include Southern University, one of the 13 HBCUs with the designation, Louisiana Tech, the University of New Orleans and LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans. 
Louisiana’s R1 universities are LSU, Tulane and the University of Louisiana Lafayette. 

Xavier University of Louisiana, University of Louisiana Monroe, Southeastern Louisiana University and LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport are designated as “research colleges and universities.”

,DC,2025-07-02 20:02:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House GOP struggles to advance megabill against  Freedom Caucus resistance,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-struggles-advance-megabill-against-freedom-caucus-resistance,,"WASHINGTON —  U.S. House Republican efforts to pass the “big, beautiful bill” hit a roadblock Wednesday, when leaders left the chamber in a holding pattern for hours before sending members back to their offices.The House was scheduled to vote on a rule that would have set up floor debate and a final passage vote for the tax break and spending cut package. But that plan was delayed indefinitely after GOP leaders had to hold open another vote as they tried to secure the votes needed to move forward amid an especially thin 220-212 majority.Far-right members of the House GOP objected strongly to the Senate version passed Tuesday, which reflected changes made during the past month compared to an earlier version passed in the House. Members of the House Freedom Caucus cited provisions dealing with immigration and the repeal of clean energy tax credits, as well as the measure’s increase in the deficit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released analysis after the Senate voted, showing the bill would increase deficits by $3.4 trillion during the next decade compared to current law.'We can't make everyone 100% happy'Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said just before walking onto the floor that he felt ​​”very positive about the progress” made during ongoing negotiations, but didn’t commit to having the necessary votes.""The thing about it is, when you have a piece of legislation that is this comprehensive and with so many agenda items involved, you're going to have lots of different priorities and preferences among people because they represent different districts and they have different interests,” Johnson said. “But we can't make everyone 100% happy. It's impossible.”Johnson said he would never ask lawmakers to “compromise core principles, but preferences must be yielded for the greater good.”South Dakota Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson told reporters before the delay that “the rule going down would be a very unfortunate development.”But he expressed confidence in Speaker Johnson’s ability to bring holdouts on board eventually, potentially by making commitments tied to future bills.""Speaker Johnson has not made any promises. He has been really good about talking about legislative vehicles that will exist in the months to come,” Dusty Johnson said. “Reconciliation is not the only tool in the Republican, or I should say in the congressional toolbox. Mike Johnson's done a good job of making people understand there are other ways we can get things done.”Trump presses House GOPSeveral House GOP lawmakers traveled to the White House earlier in the day to meet with President Donald Trump, who was working to assuage concerns through several social media posts.“THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL DEAL IS ALL ABOUT GROWTH. IF PASSED, AMERICA WILL HAVE AN ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE LIKE NEVER BEFORE,” Trump wrote. “IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING, JUST IN ANTICIPATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL BILL. DEFICIT CUT IN HALF, RECORD INVESTMENT — CASH, FACTORIES, JOBS POURING INTO THE USA. MAGA!!!”Further complicating matters were a few absences, since the House was set to be out of session this week and lawmakers experienced weather-related travel delays trying to get back to Capitol Hill. Many opted to rent cars and drive instead of trying to rebook canceled flights.But the bigger problem facing Speaker Johnson is that he cannot lose more than a handful of GOP votes and still pass the legislation. House Rules Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., urged support for approving the rule during floor debate, arguing it was essential for GOP lawmakers to deliver on campaign promises.“This legislation is the embodiment of the America First agenda and we would all do well to remember that,” Foxx said. “Failure at this critical juncture is not an option. This clock is ticking, the president and the American people are waiting. ""Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, ranking member on the panel, railed against the dozens of provisions Senate Republicans bundled together in the 870-page package, including some added just Tuesday.“This process — an abomination, legislative malpractice,” McGovern said. “Final text of this bill came out less than 24 hours ago. We met in committee an hour after it was posted and now we’re here considering a rule that only allows for one hour of debate.“This bill is within the jurisdiction of 12 different committees. One hour is ridiculous. And every minute we’re finding out new things that were snuck into the bill: a tax cut for whalers and now we’re learning about a gambling tax.”Tax cuts favor higher incomesThe bill — which underwent weeks of revisions in the Senate after a prior version barely passed the House in May — will extend and expand the 2017 GOP tax law while overhauling several safety-net programs and slashing spending on Medicaid.Those tax cuts skew toward wealthier income earners. The top 1% would receive a cut three times the size of those with incomes in the bottom 60% of after-tax income, according to analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs.The package makes substantial changes to Medicaid, including requiring some people on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month.It will block any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, essentially requiring enrollees to find other health care options for routine appointments such as cancer screenings, birth control and sexually transmitted infections treatment and screening. Using federal taxpayer dollars for abortion coverage has been restricted for decades, with limited exceptions.The legislation requires state governments to pay for a portion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the first time if they cannot get error payment rates under a certain percentage. SNAP is the primary federal nutrition program that feeds low-income people and roughly 42 million rely on it.It bolsters spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, including line items for the “golden dome” missile defense system and additional barriers along the southern border.The measure would provide a substantial funding increase to federal immigration enforcement for detention and removal of people without permanent legal status, aiding the president in carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations.The bill would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, a figure designed to get Congress past next year’s midterm elections before the country would once again bump up against the borrowing limit.Protesters milled about and held signs on street corners outside the U.S. Capitol as Republicans worked to pass the megabill. Several spoke out against cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, as well as rollbacks to clean energy tax credits contained in the budget reconciliation package.Senate turmoilThe House voted 215-214 mostly along party lines to approve the first version of the package in late May.Senate Republicans spent much of the last month reading through that, trying to determine what proposals their members supported and which elements would need to come out to comply with the strict rules that go along with writing a budget reconciliation bill.The parliamentarian, that chamber’s referee, continued to issue rulings on whether various policies in the legislation were in bounds for days before the Senate officially began debating the measure and even after they launched into vote-a-rama Monday morning.That “Byrd bath” process eventually wrapped up, allowing Senate GOP leaders to release updated text of the package shortly before the chamber took its final vote.Even with near-constant negotiations among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was unable to get everyone on board.3 Senate Republicans voted noMaine Sen. Susan Collins, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis opposed the measure, which the Senate approved on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.Collins wrote in a statement that while she supported “extending the tax relief for families and small businesses,” her opposition to the legislation “stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.”Collins also cited “additional problems” with how the legislation addressed tax credits for certain forms of energy production, which she wrote “should have been gradually phased out so as not to waste the work that has already been put into these innovative new projects and prevent them from being completed.”Tills spoke about his opposition to the bill’s changes to Medicaid during a floor speech before the Senate’s vote, arguing its cuts to spending to the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities weren’t in the best interest of GOP voters.“I’m telling the president that you have been misinformed,” Tillis said. “You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.”Tillis said he supports a policy change in the bill that would require people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program. But he was critical of other changes implemented by his Senate colleagues, and announced he won't seek reelection hours after voting against advancing the package.“I love the work requirement. I love the other reforms in this bill. They are necessary and I appreciate the leadership of the House for putting it in there,” Tillis said. “In fact, I like the work of the House so much that I wouldn’t be having to do this speech if we simply started with the House mark.”Paul said he decided to vote against the legislation because it will increase federal deficits during the next few years. “To me the most pertinent question is, how will the bill affect the deficit in the next year?” Paul said. “Currently our deficit is estimated to be a little under $2 trillion this year. What will happen to the (deficit) in 2026 if this bill passes? Well, using the math most favorable to the supporters of the bill, referred to as the policy baseline, the deficit in 2026 will still be $270 billion more than this year.”Paul added “that’s just not good if you profess to be fiscally conservative.”Ashley Murray contributed to this story.",,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

Ron DeSantis delivers remarks during a press conference in Jacksonville on Jan. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from Florida Channel)Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that was intended to limit state and local officials from using their official authority or influence to solicit campaign contributions.
The legislation (HB 1445) sponsored by Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield also would have prohibited reimbursement for transportation expenses of agency heads who live outside of Tallahassee.
The legislative proposal was introduced after NBC News reported that two top staffers in the governor’s office were calling state lobbyists to raise money for a political committee aligned with the governor at the same time that news surfaced that First Lady Casey DeSantis was considering a run for governor. State officials denied the report.
The bill was passed unanimously in the Senate and 97-1 in the House. Palm Beach Republican Mike Caruso, an ally of the governor, was the only dissenter.
Veto override?
Speaking on Matt Gaetz’s program on the One America News Network on Tuesday night, Miami-Dade House Republican Juan Porras called the veto “irresponsible” and said the Legislature could attempt to override it.
“If there were any bill that the Legislature would override the governor’s veto, it probably would be this one,” he said.
“I think in my opinion [it’s] irresponsible that the governor decided to veto this,” Porras added. “I think it looks bad on his part. But I do think this is something that all of the Legislature could probably get behind and override if the Senate probably were to agree.”
“I might know someone over there,” Gaetz quipped, referring to his father — Don Gaetz — who won re-election to the Senate last year after serving as Senate president in 2012-14 and now chairs the Ethics and Elections Committee.
The veto was no surprise, since the governor blasted the proposal earlier in the session. That’s when the legislation called for all executive branch appointees who live outside the state capital to have to move to Tallahassee.
“They’re saying all the agency heads must live in the swamp,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Pensacola in April. “I want to drain the swamp; I don’t want to refill the swamp. Where are they getting this? It’s an asinine proposal.”
Lawmakers later removed that provision, but kept the language that would prohibit executive directors of executive branch departments, secretaries of executive branch departments, and chief administrative officers of government entities housed under the executive branch from being reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred between their residences and department headquarters. It would also have prohibited per diem and subsistence allowance when remaining overnight in their county of residence.
The bill also required members of the state’s Board of Governors to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of a state university. It also required members of a state university board of trustees to be U.S. citizens and either a Florida resident or a graduate of the university overseen by such a board.
In his letter explaining his veto of the legislation on Tuesday, DeSantis focused only on that provision only of the proposal.
“CS/HB 1445 attempts to impose additional eligibility criteria by requiring members of the BOG [Board of Governors] and BOT [Board of Trustees} to be ‘either a resident of this state or a graduate of [a/the] state university.’ However, the Florida Supreme Court has ‘consistently held that statutes imposing additional qualifications for office are unconstitutional where the basic document of the constitution itself has already undertaken to set forth those requirements.’”
Bad blood
The governor’s veto of Mayfield’s bill comes with some history.
She had originally supported DeSantis run for president in 2023 but, along with a handful of GOP state lawmakers, publicly flipped their support to Donald Trump during a Republican presidential summit in Orlando that fall.
Mayfield served the past eight years in the Senate before being term-limited in 2024. She won a House seat last fall but decided to run again for her old seat earlier this year once it became vacant following Randy Fine’s decision to run for Congress.
The Florida Department of State attempted to deny her the ability to run for that seat, saying it would violate the state term limit law. She challenged that decision and won in state court a week later, and ultimately won that Senate seat last month.

Lawmakers of both political parties made their top job in the 2025 session addressing stiff increases in residential property taxes, and after negotiations that took nearly the entire session, they agreed to legislation that aims to help.
Margie MacDonald, who looks out for senior citizens as a lobbyist for Big Sky 55+, said the group she represents came out with “a big win.”
“We felt it was a major substantial cut for the vast majority of older Montanans who were hit the hardest by the 2023 property tax shift,” MacDonald said.
The most recent reappraisal cycle pushed up the median tax bill for residential payers 21%, and the increase was expected to continue. In 2023, reappraisals went up a record 46% on average.
Now, the work done at the Capitol is starting to shape up in the real world, and local and state legislators and lobbyists are counting wins — such a change in the conversation about who’s to blame — and already pointing to losses — such as hefty increases for Montanans who own second homes.
This week, the Department of Revenue announced it is sending out reappraisal notices to property taxpayers and asked them to review them as soon as possible. The DOR said the information will reflect the recent changes signed into law.
“It’s important that Montana property owners review this information,” said Brendan Beatty, director of the Montana Department of Revenue, in a statement. “If property owners wait until property tax bills are sent in November, it will be too late for the department to correct property characteristics and make adjustments that may impact the value of the property for Tax Year 2025.”
House Appropriations Chairman Llew Jones, largely seen as the architect of the property tax redesign in the 2025 session, said he believes the new system evens out a spike that had put a significant burden on residential payers at the expense of other classes.
Jones said the business lobby paid lower taxes, but this session, they weren’t quite as happy.
“They all walked the halls and yelled at me,” said Jones, R-Conrad.
An analysis Jones shared from the Department of Revenue shows the before-and-after estimates of payments based on changes from House Bill 231 and Senate Bill 542 — the two main bills that together addressed property taxes.
The analysis assumes other factors remain the same, such as local levies.
In Cascade County, for example, a home valued at $400,000 would have been billed $3,225 without any change from the legislature.
With the pair of bills that passed, the owner will be billed an estimated $2,217 instead in 2025 and $2,238 in 2026, according to the analysis, again, with other factors being equal. That’s a difference of $987.
“For many Montana homeowners — with homes around $400,000 — the estimated savings top $1,000 or more per year,” Jones said in a statement. “But remember: these are projections. Actual savings will depend on local mill levies set by your county, city and schools.”
County Commissioner Josh Slotnick of Missoula said increases in value coming soon from the Department of Revenue might “usurp the gains” people may have experienced in property tax relief, if not completely, at least partially.
But Slotnick said one important thing that happened in the most recent session goes beyond the work to reduce the hit to residential payers. He said Gov. Greg Gianforte “is forever saying your local officials have a spending problem.”
But Slotnick said legislators, including Jones and Missoula Democratic Reps. Mark Thane and Jonathan Karlen, were able to respond to data instead — which showed the burden had shifted onto residential taxpayers.
“A huge victory is that to a large degree, the discussion stopped being about, ‘How do we stop county commissioners and mayors from spending like drunken sailors?’ To, ‘How do we deal with the burden shift?’” said Slotnick, a Democrat.
He said the outcome is a nod to fairness.
“This solution isn’t a Democratic solution. It isn’t a Republican solution. It’s a solution based in reality,” Slotnick said.

Gianforte, a Republican, signed the pair of bills that account for the property tax redesign.
Together, HB 231 and SB 542 provide for a graduated tax rate with three tiers for homes, support a rebate, and offer relief for homes that are primary residences, including long-term rentals, among other provisions.
The governor vetoed a bill that would have expanded a property tax credit for elderly people.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said the program in House Bill 831 would have cost $7 million, the program already works well in its current form, and seniors benefit from the other property tax relief bills he signed.
Meanwhile, residential property taxpayers also recently received postcards about a smaller short-term patch — a reminder from the Department of Revenue that property tax rebates of up to $400 will be available starting August 15, 2025.
Although some politicians praise the outcome from Helena, Commissioner Mike McGinley, from Beaverhead County, remains skeptical that residents in his district will benefit.
McGinley is a Republican who has been one of the most outspoken local politicians when it comes to recent property tax increases and challenges for local governments.
He has pointed out that local governments have been living under a constraint in state law that allowed them to increase property taxes in general just half the rate of inflation — putting them more behind year after year.
McGinley said he isn’t convinced the new system will work well in Beaverhead County.
For the county itself, he said, an estimated 27% drop for residential payers will probably hit agriculture and commercial classes and “cause a little controversy.”
Also, he said Dillon, the county seat, doesn’t have a diverse tax base, so the only way to make up the difference is by levying more mills — on the same residential payers.
McGinley said maybe on the whole, the legislation will help residential payers in the state, especially by shifting some of the responsibility to people with second homes. But he said he doesn’t believe some taxpayers in his district will see relief.
“People who are expecting these big tax decreases better buckle down. It can’t happen,” McGinley said.
Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, who spoke throughout the legislative session about hardships on seniors, said tens of thousands of people who qualified for the property tax rebate issued after the last 2023 session still missed out.
Dunwell said she worries that the same people who either didn’t hear about the rebate or had trouble with the application will be in the same boat this time.
This year, the state is paying rebates, and rebate applications automatically enroll a property taxpayer in the homestead rate reduction starting in 2026, according to a recent guest piece in the Missoulian from Thane, Karlen, and other Democratic members of the House Tax Committee.
“The poorest people, the most vulnerable, the most disenfranchised, the ones who generally fall through the cracks, are again going to fall through the cracks,” Dunwell said.
The Department of Revenue did not answer questions sent Friday about the outreach it is doing, in addition to the postcard, to ensure eligible people receive the breaks the legislature intended. In fall 2023, the DOR estimated 43,000 people who were eligible for rebates had not received them.
Although Dunwell raised concerns, she also said the property tax relief package that passed is an improvement, and if something isn’t working — “we’ll come back next session and fix it.”
The redesign aimed to support Montana residents with one home, a “homestead,” including by dropping the rate for the first $400,000 in value from 1.35% to 0.76% — while the rate for second homes goes from 1.35% to 1.9%.
Some Montana residents who aren’t rich but have family cabins have said the outcome means they get a break on their main residence but “crushing increases” on their second home.
“For many families, that may mean being forced to sell long-held properties and likely losing them to out-of-state buyers,” said Vicki Turner of Helena in a letter Dunwell shared. “That’s not only unfair, but it is also unjust and heartbreaking.”
Jones, though, said the goal was to support the majority of Montana residents — “the vast majority of folks are just trying to pay for their one house.” He said Montanans with vacation homes aren’t treated differently than others with vacation homes.
“Most folks don’t have two homes,” Jones said.
Slotnick, with Missoula County, said the difficulty in a place where values keep increasing is that even if commissioners increase taxes 4%, that bump could translate into a 20% increase in someone’s property tax bill.
“How it’s not fair is the increase in your home’s value is not an accurate value of your ability to pay,” Slotnick said.”
The pair of property tax relief bills reduce the tax rate on a graduated scale for residential property, which lowers the taxable value of the property, he said. In doing so, he said, it shifts the tax burden back to other classes of payers.
“The reason this is so difficult is some of those others (taxpayer groups) have really intense lobbyists and attorneys who typically win their arguments,” Slotnick said.
Slotnick said he appreciates the legislation because people with homes that have a lower value will get a larger reduction, and that result pleases him as a progressive Democrat.
But he also said people in Missoula, for example, won’t see as much relief as residents of some other counties because Missoula has a lot more houses in the $750,000 to $800,000 range.
“We have a whole bunch of middle income people who really need help who, through no fault of their own, own a $850,000 home,” he said. “I am one of them.”
(Slotnick, a farmer, said he bought a $250,000 property in 2000, and it’s now worth $850,000.)
But Slotnick also said legislators applied a scale they thought would work for the most people, and the bills are fair.

Glenn Youngkin, flanked by Petersburg Police Chief Travis Christian, speaks to reporters at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond on July 2, 2025. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday doubled down on the controversial use of courthouse arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, brushing off criticism that some of the individuals detained were simply in court to pay fines for traffic infractions and had no criminal record.
“Let’s just be clear, the vast majority of the people that have been arrested at courthouses around the country are committing violent crimes,” Youngkin said at a press conference at the Virginia State Police headquarters in Richmond. “If someone breaks the law and is here illegally, they should be arrested.”
Although not involved in the recent courthouse raids, Youngkin hailed efforts by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a state-federal partnership he launched in February to target gang members, narcotics traffickers and undocumented immigrants with criminal records. 
“This work is critical, and it’s happening all over the commonwealth of Virginia,” he said. “We just passed over 2,500 arrests through our Virginia Homeland Security Task Force. Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members.”
Describing the task force as a “national model of success,” Youngkin credited the rapid rollout of Virginia’s 287(g) agreement with ICE — approved just 20 hours after his Executive Order 47 in February — for much of the operation’s momentum. The program allows state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.
“It started with a plan, and then stepped to a 287(g) memorandum with the federal government and our State Police and our Department of Corrections, and yes, some of our local law enforcement partners,” Youngkin said Wednesday. “This is a concerted effort to collaborate with the federal government to make sure that violent criminals that are here illegally are arrested.”
When asked by The Mercury about recent arrests in Chesterfield County, where ICE agents detained at least 14 people over several days last week — including a man who had come to court to pay traffic fines — Youngkin didn’t waver.
“First of all, if you break the law in America and you’re here illegally, then you should be detained and deported,” he said. “That’s common sense.”
Youngkin emphasized that ICE is not targeting houses of worship or schools and accused the media of distorting the intent of enforcement efforts.
“They’re not going to schools and they’re not going to churches … the media really wants to try to sow deceit,” he said.
Several news reports, however, confirm ICE has conducted arrests on church grounds and near schools since sensitive-location protections were rolled back. 
In California, migrants were detained outside churches and in parking lots, sparking backlash from local faith leaders. Meanwhile, school districts across the U.S. are preparing for ICE presence amid concerns over student safety and civil rights. 
And in Washington, D.C., immigration officers attempted to detain a school healthcare worker at a local elementary school parking lot — prompting school officials to demand ID and warrants before letting them on campus.
The arrests in Chesterfield drew immediate backlash from community leaders and local officials, who say the enforcement actions are sweeping up residents with no history of violent crime and undermining public trust in the legal system.
One of those detained was Salvador Calderon-Cuellar, whose immigration status remains unclear. 
According to court records, Calderon-Cuellar pleaded guilty in April to two traffic violations — driving without a license and failure to yield — and appeared at the Chesterfield courthouse on June 25 to pay a $130 fine when ICE officers took him into custody through the back entrance.
Jessica Schneider, a member of the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors, was addressing a protest outside the courthouse when she learned of his arrest.
“He had no prior arrests,” she said. “Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?”
Protesters condemned the arrests as politically motivated and harmful to due process. Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, called the courthouse a “sacred place in a democracy,” warning that ICE raids would dissuade victims and witnesses from engaging with the legal system.
The courthouse operation is part of a larger statewide trend. 
In addition to Chesterfield, ICE has carried out arrests in Sterling, Albemarle County, and Richmond in recent months. In a joint ICE-FBI operation in Northern Virginia  seven undocumented individuals were detained in what the agency described as a targeted enforcement effort.
Youngkin’s task force is comprised of more than 200 officers from the FBI, ICE, Virginia State Police, and the Department of Corrections. 
ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said in April the expanded use of 287(g) agreements has been a key driver of arrests in Virginia. FBI Director Kash Patel called the effort “a tremendous success,” while U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the governor’s alignment with the Trump administration’s “Make America Safe Again” agenda.
But research complicates the narrative that undocumented immigrants pose an outsized threat. A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice found that undocumented immigrants in Texas were arrested at significantly lower rates than U.S.-born citizens — including for violent, property, and drug crimes.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, said in a statement last week that the Chesterfield arrests “desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.” He has proposed reforms to restrict ICE access to courthouses, labeling the raids a violation of constitutional dignity.
And Amanda Pohl, clerk of the Chesterfield Circuit Court, said she only became aware of the ICE operation after it was already underway. 
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here,” she told The Mercury. While her office doesn’t coordinate with ICE, she said she was reviewing internal policy to ensure “this is a courthouse where people feel safe.”
But for Youngkin, the political calculus is clear. “This is about safety,” he said Wednesday. “And today, Virginia is safer.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a proclamation for a special session on Wednesday, calling Legislators back to Juneau in August to pass legislation on education reform and his executive order creating a new Department of Agriculture.
The special session also means that lawmakers cannot wait until January to vote on overrides to the governor’s budget vetoes and his vetoes on several policy bills. They must vote in the first five days of the special session.
That’s significant, because 45 votes are needed to override a budget veto, and while there were 46 votes in favor of a prior veto override this spring, at least one legislator who voted in favor of that override will be unavailable in August.
The 30-day special session is scheduled to begin 10 a.m. August 2 in Juneau.
Agriculture is currently overseen by a division within the Department of Natural Resources. 
​​“Enacting a few necessary reforms to our public education system can elevate those children struggling in Alaska’s school system,” said Dunleavy in an email statement with the announcement. “As elected officials we must do all we can to put the next generation on the path to a successful and prosperous future, and that starts with a solid public education. Splitting the Division of Agriculture away from DNR into a department will elevate food security and support our hard-working farmers while growing the agricultural sector.”
The announcement comes in the wake of a historic veto override vote, 46-14, by the Legislature rejecting Dunleavy’s veto of an education funding bill, House Bill 57, raising the core of the state’s education formula by  $700 per student. Dunleavy then made a budget veto of part of the funding for schools, pushing it down to $500 per student, and House and Senate leadership have promised to override that veto in the next session. 
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said he was surprised by the announcement and learned about it from reporters calling him for comment.
The special session will force lawmakers to vote early on veto overrides for education funding and a variety of other bills, he said. Legislative attorneys have told lawmakers that with the governor’s proclamation, they cannot defer those votes until the regular session begins in January.
That’s a problem for supporters of an education veto override, because 45 of 60 legislators are needed for that vote to succeed. This spring, a policy veto override garnered 46 votes, but Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is in Poland on a National Guard deployment and is expected to be unavailable in August.
Other legislators may also be unavailable, Stevens said.
And supporters of an override have questioned whether all of the votes from the previous override vote will hold for a budget override.
In May, lawmakers voted 32-28 to deny an executive order by Dunleavy to create a new Department of Agriculture, citing the proposal’s costs as well as creation through an executive order rather than as legislation, with public input.

That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.","A foggy morning at Calispell Meadows on the Colville National Forest in northeast Washington. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Forest Service)More than half a million acres of trees spread across Washington were sick, struggling, or dead last year, according to the results of an aerial survey of forests by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.
Surveyors identified about 545,000 acres with some level of tree mortality, defoliation, or disease, the department said this week. That’s less than 1% of the total forestland surveyed.
The amount of forest with problems is up nearly 30,000 acres from 2023 and more than the 10-year average of 519,000 acres, but well below the acres mapped with diseased or dead trees in 2022, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service partnered to conduct an aerial survey of 22 million forested acres in Washington state to observe recently killed and damaged trees. They carried out the survey between June and September last year.
The agencies, as well as the Oregon State Department of Forestry, have been partnering on aerial detection surveys since 1947, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
Washington experienced above average temperatures for the majority of 2024, with some level of drought observed on most lands by fall.
“The main climate takeaway for Washington in 2024 was the continuation of long-term warming trends,” the Department of Natural Resources stated in the report. “For the third time in four years, the annual average temperature in Washington was among the 10 warmest on record.”
The “unusually dry and warm weather” likely contributed to tree stress and insect success, the Department of Natural Resources reported.
Insects were the primary cause of the tree damage mapped last year.
Bark beetles, in particular, were responsible for about 270,000 acres of damage. Notable bark beetles with high activity are the fir engraver, the mountain pine beetle, the western pine beetle and the silver fir beetle.
While the silver fir beetle only damaged 2,900 acres of Washington forests last year, up from just 500 acres in 2023, Department of Natural Resources entomologist Glenn Kohler said that beetle’s damage is among the most visible, given its presence in the North Cascades National Park, Snoqualmie Pass and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.
“We will certainly be interested to see if the current peak is sustained for a second year,” Kohler said.
Another outbreak noted in the 2024 report is the continued presence of the California fivespined ips beetle, which has been the cause of increasing pine tree deaths since 2022 in urban forest settings around the Puget Sound region. The beetle was first detected in Washington in 2010.
Also of concern is the western spruce budworm, which caused defoliation damage to more than 63,500 acres of forest in 2024 after three years of no recorded activity.
Western spruce budworm outbreaks are uncommon in Washington state, according to the Department of Natural Resources, with the last outbreaks occurring in 2011 and 2012.
The current outbreak is most visible east of Ross Lake in Whatcom, Skagit and Okanogan counties, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The 10-year average of forest damage in Washington is skewed by a two-year gap during the COVID pandemic, when the full 22 million acres of Washington state’s forest were not surveyed.
A total of 550,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2021, but only 19 million acres were surveyed that year. Similarly, only 10.5 million acres were surveyed in 2020, with 322,000 acres of damage mapped.
Data used for those two surveys was acquired through a combination of ground sampling and remote sensing in place of survey flights.
The standard 22 million acres of Washington’s forests were mapped in 2019, 2022 and 2023. A total of 658,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2019, 672,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2022, and 517,000 damaged acres were mapped in 2023.
“Similar to wildfire season data, it’s better to make observations over a longer period, like a 10 year stretch, to gauge trendlines,” said Will Rubin, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources.
The data is included in an annual Department of Natural Resources report that summarizes insects, diseases, and other disturbances affecting Washington’s forests.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/colville-national-forest.jpg,,,2025-07-02 16:09:16.025004

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Tuesday marked the first day that Montanans can say that abortion — up to the point of viability — is protected specifically through an amendment in the state’s Constitution.
Voters in November overwhelmingly supported the constitutional right, even though the procedure has long been legal, and Constitutional Initiative 128 became the law of the state, despite a last-minute legal challenge.
That challenge was rebuffed on Tuesday by a unanimous decision of the Montana Supreme Court not to hear the case brought by several individuals and the Montana Life Defense Fund, a committee association with the Montana Family Foundation. The lawsuit asked the high court to intervene, halt the amendment from going into effect, and declare it void, due to concerns that voters on Election Day did not have enough information to properly decide the issue.
The Supreme Court dismissed the late challenge, and said that the suit was poorly timed and didn’t even develop a set of facts adequately. Meanwhile, the Montana Family Foundation said while it was disappointed in the decision, it would continue the fight at the district court level.
“We remain confident in the strength of our arguments and will now proceed at the district court level. While today’s decision is a setback in timing, it is not the end of the road. This is justice delayed — not justice denied,” said Derek Oestreicher, chief legal counsel for the Montana Family Foundation.
Two plaintiffs, Joe Addy and Hannah Rhodes, had asked the high court to intervene and invalidate CI-128, which makes abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability. They argued that because the text of the entire amendment was not printed fully on the ballot, and because voters who registered to vote on Election Day did not have the full text or the voter information booklet issued by the state, they were not adequately informed.
However, the Montana Supreme Court rejected all of those arguments and criticized the plaintiffs for bringing the challenge just a few weeks before the abortion amendment was to be enacted.
Moreover, the court said that CI-128 was handled the same way as every other ballot measure since 1978, so that if the court would have accepted the argument, it opened up the possibility that all amendments since were also constitutionally deficient.
“Any urgency of emergency that exists is entirely of the Defense Fund’s own making, because it waited seven months to file this petition,” the court said in the seven-page order, which outlined why it turned down the request. “We have repeatedly warned parties they cannot manufacture an emergency due to lack of diligence.”
While the plaintiffs said they did not know what they were voting for or against by registering to vote on Election Day with the full text of the amendment not printed on the ballot, the court criticized them because copies of the full voters’ guide and the full text are required to be available at every voting precinct.
“The Defense Fund does not tell us how many election-day registrants exist for the 2024 General Election, nor does it assert that the number of election-day registrants was sufficient to change the outcome of this vote,” the court noted.
The Supreme Court also pointed out that state law requires the Montana Secretary of State to print a voter information guide, as well as preparing the ballot information for publication in newspapers or other platforms at the county and state level.
In addition to publishing the text in newspapers around the state and having voting guides sent to all registered voters and available at the polling locations, the Supreme Court said that “the Secretary of State maintains a website, accessible to the public, that includes the (Voter Information Pamphlet) along with other information about Montana’s elections.”
“The Defense Fund has not demonstrated that the electorate was not provided with the full text of CI-128,” the order said. “…And it has not developed the facts necessary to support its legal arguments.”

Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis. Evers talks to reporters in March. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Ahead of floor sessions for the Senate and Assembly to vote on the budget, Gov. Tony Evers signed bills into law launching efforts to bring nuclear power to Wisconsin and creating and expanding programs to help children in crisis.
The bills passed the Senate and Assembly in floor sessions in June where debate centered heavily on the lack of funding attached to them. Evers had earlier told lawmakers to include the funding or he would veto the legislation, Democrats agreed the funding should be included, while Republicans said the funding would come in the budget if Evers signed the bills without any changes. State funding for the bills was included in the budget plan approved by the budget committee Tuesday.
One law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 11, will create a Nuclear Power Summit Board in Wisconsin responsible for putting on a summit in Madison to advance nuclear power and fusion energy technology.
The summit must be held within one month after instruction starts at the new engineering building at UW-Madison. Construction on the building, which is estimated to cost $419 million, started in April and is supposed to be finished in 2028. The funding for the building was approved by the Legislature and Evers in 2024.
Evers also signed 2025 Wisconsin Act 12, which requires the Public Service Commission to conduct a study to determine potential sites for a nuclear power plant. The state budget bill includes $2 million to fund the study.
Evers said the bills would help the state pursue an “innovative, clean energy future and bring more clean jobs to our state.”
Wisconsin currently has one active nuclear power plant. The Point Beach Nuclear Plant located in Two Rivers, which first came online in the 1970s, has two tractors and provides about 16% of the state’s energy, according to the conservative think tank the Badger Institute. A Kewaunee nuclear power plant shut down in 2013. 
“We can’t afford to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment or creating good-paying jobs and building a strong economy, and by working toward clean energy options Wisconsinites can depend on in the future, we’re doing both,” Evers said. “We must continue our efforts to help lower energy costs and improve energy independence by reducing our reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and these bills are an important step in the right direction.”
Evers also signed Senate Bill 106, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 9, that will create psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) in the state. The law is the result of a study committee on the emergency detention and civil commitment of minors and aims to reduce the number of  youth in crisis who are sent out of state for care by offering long-term mental health treatment closer to home.
The budget will include $1.79 million for grants to psychiatric residential treatment facilities.
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 10, which is also a result of the study committee, instructs the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to create a statewide portal to facilitate the sharing of safety plans for minors with designated safety plan partners. The budget includes about $819,000 in state funding for the program and the agency will get one staff position to run the portal. 
Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), who served as chair of the study committee, has championed the legislation this session.
At a press conference ahead of the Senate floor session, James said his focus has been on supporting Wisconsin’s children and that the issues are personal for him as a father and a law enforcement officer.
“I believe there are real positive changes within our reach. It’s about recognizing the opportunities in front of us and taking decisive action when that moment comes,” James said. “This budget is packed with great projects. We increase funding for our child advocacy centers. We take care of our child victims in a safe environment. We establish funding for psychiatric residential treatment facilities to keep children with intense mental health treatment needs closer to home.” 
Another law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 13, officially recognizes new child advocacy centers in state statute and expands the number of them that are eligible for the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s child advocacy grant program. The centers work with law enforcement to investigate child abuse and neglect and provide children with resources and support. The budget will include $2 million to support the grants. 
The final piece of legislation is 2025 Wisconsin Act 14, to distribute hearing protection devices to state and local law enforcement and firefighters. The budget will include $2.6 million to fund the program.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The same year Nebraskans voted to cement an abortion ban beyond the first trimester into the state constitution, the number of abortions performed in Nebraska rose about 7.6%. 
According to data from the state Department of Health and Human Services, at least 2,501 abortions were performed in Nebraska in 2024. That’s 176 higher than 2023’s total of 2,325 abortions in one year. 
Since 2020, Nebraska’s abortion rate has remained relatively level between about 2,300 to 2,500 procedures per year. All the while, the state’s abortion policy has fluctuated more wildly. 
In 2022, when Nebraska banned abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy, state lawmakers were considering a full abortion ban that would be triggered when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
The trigger bill did not pass, and the next year lawmakers returned with a proposal to ban most abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. That proposal did not pass either, but in the same session lawmakers approved an amended bill to ban most abortions at 12 weeks post-gestation. 
For the 2024 election, abortion-rights advocates launched an initiative to expand abortion access within the Nebraska Constitution, which was swiftly met with an opposing initiative aimed at enshrining the current ban in the constitution. The more restrictive measure passed by roughly 55% of voters.
Breaking down the data
Nebraska’s monthly abortion rate in 2024 fluctuated between a low of 174 recorded in February, up to 250 recorded in October, just before the election. 
By far, the most popular method for undergoing an abortion was via medication, which accounted for 2,024 of the 2,501 abortions recorded in 2024 — just under 81% overall. The second most common method was curettage with suction, which made up 475 abortions that year.

Nebraska voters approve constitutional amendment Initiative 434, banning most abortions past the first trimester

Compared to 2023, Nebraska saw fewer clients traveling from other states for abortions in 2024. In 2023, Nebraska logged clients from 19 outside states, while 2024 logged 14 other states. 
The number of clients traveling from each of those states also dropped in all but one state. For example, neighbor Kansas had 51 patients in 2023 compared to just two in 2024, and Texas had 46 patients in 2023 and 10 in 2024. 
The outlier is Iowa, which already made up the largest amount of out-of-state clients in 2023, with 222 that year. In 2024, that number rose to 358 clients. 
This comes as no surprise to Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States (PPNCS). Iowa bans most abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which typically happens around six weeks of pregnancy. Advocates have said this essentially amounts to a total ban, as most women don’t realize they’re pregnant at that point. 
In a PPNCS press release, the organization reported that abortions performed in Iowa dropped sharply after its ban took effect in the summer of 2024. In comparison, abortions provided in Nebraska have risen about 68% since Roe was overturned in 2022, Richardson said. 
“More people must travel to get essential health care, when they deserve to be able to get it in their own communities,” Richardson said in the press release. “And yet amidst all this chaos and manufactured confusion, we have innovated and implemented solutions that have increased the number of abortion patients we have served.”    
Sandy Danek, executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, agreed that Iowa’s new abortion ban likely contributed to the rise in Iowan clients traveling to Nebraska for abortions in 2024. She said women who feel like they need an abortion often seek out states with more “liberal” abortion laws when their state is more restrictive. 
DHHS’ data reported that more than half of Nebraska’s abortions performed in 2024 happened between six to eight weeks gestation. Considering that, Danek said she feels the state’s current abortion ban past the first trimester is still too lax. She also acknowledged that further restrictions may risk encouraging Nebraskans to travel to states where abortions are more accessible. 
Danek said there are plenty of alternatives to abortions available to women who may feel they have no other option, but the challenge lies in getting the word out to those women. 
“You want to balance your dollar to both provide those services to women, but then also reach out to make the community know that they exist,” Danek said. “And that’s a juggling act.”
Implications for Nebraska’s future 
Following voters’ approval of the first-trimester abortion ban in November, abortion-rights advocates speculated that officials in the anti-abortion camp would use the victory to push for further restrictions. Officials in that camp, including Gov. Jim Pillen, told a different story, saying that it wasn’t the right time to try for more. 
While there were no bills introduced in Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session that would have directly increased the state’s abortion ban, several bills were introduced that advocates claim were intended to narrow abortion access. Those included a bill to increase requirements for medication abortions from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue (LB 512), and a bill to require the burial or cremation of abortion remains from Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair (LB 632).

Neither of those bills passed this session, but both will remain on the books when lawmakers reconvene in 2026. 
Though it’s too early for Nebraska Right to Life to identify priorities for the 2026 session, Danek said she supports Holdcroft’s bill. Given that the vast majority of recent Nebraska abortions are performed through medication, and she claims abortion pills are linked to a range of negative side effects, Danek said LB 512 is “a good starting place.” 
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood officials are grappling with potential new obstacles at the federal level. Congress is considering a version of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood for one year for any health care service provided by the organization. 
The bill passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, and is up for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives as early as this week. 
Through this uncertainty, Richardson said PPNCS is looking for ways to expand their services, particularly for clients in health care deserts who have to travel longer distances for in-person care. She said they are increasing their investments in telehealth and service lines for primary care, for example.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks. 
These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget. 
The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.” 
The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes. 
Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.

Lowering the information barrier
Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.
Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.
Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.
“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.
This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.
Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.
She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.
“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.
He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.
“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”
Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s  extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions. 
“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.” 
Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change. 
She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations. 
Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers. 
“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”
The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics. 
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill. 
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs. 
“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads. 
Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.” 
“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”
The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.
The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies. 
Reports form the Hub
While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.
Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said. 
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture. 
Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.  
The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions. 
The hub, in collaboration with on Midwest Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates. 
Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts. 
She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.” 
“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said. 
Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.” 
“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance, formerly known as Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition)A study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that emergency room clinicians were much less likely to refer Black opioid overdose patients for outpatient treatment compared with white patients.
The researchers looked at the medical records of 1,683 opioid overdose patients from emergency rooms in nine states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
About 5.7% of Black patients received referrals for outpatient treatment, compared with 9.6% of white patients, according to the researchers, who received a federal grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to conduct the analysis.
States, hospital systems try less punitive drug testing of pregnant women and newborns

While the nation saw a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in white people between 2021 and 2022, overdose death rates increased for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black and Hispanic people. Patients visiting ERs for opioid overdoses are more likely to die from an overdose after the visit, the authors wrote, underscoring the importance of gaining “an improved understanding of disparities in [emergency department] treatment and referral.”
In total, roughly 18% of the patients received a referral for outpatient treatment, 43% received a naloxone kit or prescription, and 8.4% received a prescription for buprenorphine, the first-line medication for treating opioid use disorder.
The researchers used records from 10 hospital sites participating in a national consortium collecting data on overdoses from fentanyl and its related drugs. The patient records were from September 2020 to November 2023.
Another study in JAMA Network Open, released Thursday, found similar disparities: Black and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive buprenorphine. Black patients had a 17% chance, and Hispanic patients a 16% chance, to be prescribed the therapy, compared with a 20% chance for white patients.
The authors of that study, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, looked at data from 176,000 records of opioid-related events between 2017 and 2022 across all 50 states.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government’s program that gives payments to people sickened by nuclear weapons testing or uranium mining and milling — including in South Dakota — is one step closer to being reauthorized and expanded.
On Tuesday, Senate Republicans passed their massive tax and spending package, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” — among its many provisions is an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which expired more than a year ago.
If the bill clears the final vote needed from the House, downwinders in all of Utah will now receive compensation for their medical bills, marking a significant change to the program that advocates say was too narrow to begin with.
People exposed to radiation from uranium mining and milling in South Dakota — primarily decades ago in the Edgemont area at the southern end of the Black Hills — were previously eligible for compensation and would remain eligible under the reauthorization. Seventy-nine claims from people residing in South Dakota have been awarded by the program since its inception, totaling $6.76 million.
Here are the RECA highlights, found in the final pages of the Senate’s 887-page bill:

Downwinders in all of Utah, New Mexico and Idaho would now be eligible for payments. Coverage would also be widened in Arizona to include all of Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo, Apache, Gila, and Mohave counties. Residents who lived in certain parts of Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska and Kentucky who were sickened due to the Manhattan Project would also receive coverage.
The program’s new expiration date would be Dec. 31, 2028.
In some cases, people who lived in affected areas for just one year would be eligible for compensation — the program previously required they live there at least two years.
The compensation amount — originally $50,000 to $75,000 — would be increased to $100,000 in most cases.
Uranium miners and workers based in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Washington, Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Texas would be covered. The timeframe of eligibility would also be extended from 1971 to 1990.

“RECA is generational legislation for Missouri and will finally deliver justice for survivors in the St. Louis region,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who sponsored the provision. “I call on the House to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump’s desk.”
RECA expired in June 2024 after Congress failed to reauthorize it, and in the year since, downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer or who didn’t know about the program were left without compensation.
The program had been in place since 1990, but downwinders have long said it should be expanded. Despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
News that RECA was one step closer to revival was met with mixed reactions on Tuesday from Utah downwinder Mary Dickson. A longtime advocate for RECA expansion, Dickson said it was “bittersweet” — if the bill passes the House, she’ll finally be eligible for coverage, after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985.
But Dickson and other advocates hoped a RECA expansion would be broader, covering all of Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Guam and other places impacted by Cold War weapons testing.
“Obviously I’m happy to see more downwinders covered. I’m very happy to see that. But I’m also heartsick to see that so many others that we’ve been fighting with in this battle for so long are left out,” she said. “It feels a bit like a hollow victory to me.”
Last year, Hawley sponsored a bill that would expand the program to cover much of the West, and parts of the St. Louis area, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House, mostly over spending concerns.
It’s not yet clear whether RECA has the support needed in the House to withstand the final vote. The New York Times estimates that the current proposed expansion will cost about $7.7 billion.

Surtax spending gets ‘complicated’,Sam Drysdale // State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/supplementing-or-supplanting-surtax-spending-gets-complicated/,"
The Legislature this week agreed to use nearly $500 million in surtax revenue to deliver a major boost to K-12 school funding, a move that some see as fulfilling the voter-approved mission of the tax on high earners while others warn it strays from the original promise of funding new education and transportation initiatives.
The post Supplementing or suppla[...]","THE LEGISLATURE this week agreed to use nearly $500 million in surtax revenue to deliver a major boost to K-12 school funding, a move that some see as fulfilling the voter-approved mission of the tax on high earners while others warn it strays from the original promise of funding new education and transportation initiatives.
The budget that lawmakers sent to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk Monday includes a $496 million expansion to the state’s Chapter 70 funding that provides education revenue for local school districts. The money is being drawn from revenue generated by the 4 percent surtax on annual income over $1 million, approved by voters in 2022 through a ballot question, also called the Fair Share Amendment.
That single line item (1596-2450) accounts for just more than 20 percent of the $2.4 billion in surtax spending lawmakers agreed to for the fiscal 2026 budget. It represents a shift in how that revenue is being used — and it has drawn mixed reactions even among the groups that campaigned for the surtax in the first place.
“This budget was crafted with concern over what is going on at the federal level,” Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page said, referring to anticipated cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration. Though the union previously warned against using surtax funds to replace routine and recurring education spending, Page said this year’s context made the decision more understandable.
“But, importantly, we certainly would hope that this much to fulfill the SOA wouldn’t be a part of next year’s budget,” he said, referring to the 2019 Student Opportunity Act, which is phasing in more than $1.5 billion in additional funding for districts over seven years. “The way it’s been working, which we really approve of, is the regular budget funds the SOA investments, and we can do new investments like higher minimum aid, universal school meals, capital fund investments, through Fair Share.”
The fiscal 2026 budget increases Chapter 70 funding by $460 million over the previous year, according to the Senate Ways and Means Committee — and funds that increase with surtax dollars. In addition to supporting the fifth year of SOA implementation, the $496 million line item for so-called SOA expansion also includes a sharp increase in minimum per-pupil aid, from $104 to $150.
In past budgets, similar increases to Chapter 70 were paid for through general state revenues. The shift this year raised red flags for those who view the surtax as a way to go above and beyond standard funding obligations.
“Voters overwhelmingly approved the Fair Share Amendment to enable new investments in public education and transportation — not to plug existing budget gaps,” said Bahar Akman Imboden, director of the Hildreth Institute, a research center focused on equity in higher education. She said she was “disappointed” to see nearly $500 million “being used to backfill” K-12 spending.
Imboden warned that reallocating surtax revenue to cover existing commitments could undermine recent progress in spending surtax dollars on higher education, which has included making community colleges free and financial aid expansions. 
Those initiatives are continued in this budget, but she warned, “without corresponding investments in campus capacity, student supports, and infrastructure, the gains we’ve made in encouraging more Massachusetts students to pursue higher education will falter.”
About 11 percent of the surtax revenue in the fiscal 2026 budget is allocated to higher education, according to the Hildreth Institute — a roughly $5 million decrease from the previous year. On average, higher education line items saw a 0.5 percent increase in the fiscal 2026 budget, the Institute noted.
In previous years, surtax funds have been used to launch major new programs like universal free school meals, fare-free Regional Transit Authorities and free community college for all Massachusetts residents. Those are continued in the fiscal 2026 budget. Groups who backed the surtax saw those programs as examples of using the money for “supplementing, not supplanting” existing spending on education and transportation through general revenue.
In the first budget cycle after the surtax passed, the MTA issued an analysis praising the Legislature’s approach.
“Importantly, Senate Ways and Means, the House and the governor use Fair Share Amendment revenue in the FY24 budget only for new programs and expenditures,” the union wrote. “Regular annual increases for state programs, including a $595 million increase for Chapter 70 and more than $62 million for Special Education Circuit Breaker, are funded out of general state revenue – not Fair Share revenue.”
This year’s decision breaks from that precedent. But a policy analyst from a think tank that backed the surtax campaign says the change was likely necessary in the face of economic uncertainty, tighter general revenues, and a difficult fiscal year for most school districts around the state.
“There are more new things you could do if you weren’t using so much of it for Chapter 70, so it’s hard to see in isolation. It’s complicated,” said Colin Jones, deputy policy director at the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.
“But this year when we hear talk about things like the impact of the trade war, tariffs, the economy and the federal budget, they’re building flexibility with this maneuver to increase Fair Share to cover basically all of the Chapter 70 increase this year,” he said. “That frees up general funds to do other stuff. And flexibility in this environment is pretty good.”
The Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, which led the ballot campaign to pass the surtax, also defended the Legislature’s approach.
“The Constitution doesn’t allow specific appropriations in a ballot measure, so it gives the Legislature the ability to spend the money on the priorities that they choose, and we expect that those priorities may shift and evolve as time goes on,” said Andrew Farnitano, a spokesperson for the coalition.
Farnitano pointed to the strength of surtax revenue collections as a sign the funding stream can be relied upon for major investments. 
“The intention of the amendment was to give the state the resources to make these decisions and have these conversations through the budget process, where we have the resources that are necessary,” he said.
When asked about concerns over the volatility of surtax revenues — which depend on high-income earners  — Farnitano responded, “The evidence so far is showing that Fair Share revenues are very strong and can be counted upon.”
Indeed, the Department of Revenue reported in May that it had collected nearly $2.6 billion from the surtax between July 1, 2024 and April 30, 2025 — exceeding the total for all of fiscal 2024 with two months of fiscal 2025 still to be counted. Secretary of Administration and Finance Matthew Gorzkowicz has said total fiscal 2025 surtax collections could approach $3 billion.
Meanwhile, general tax collections have plateaued.
From the House floor Monday, House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz made the case for moving Chapter 70 obligations into the surtax category.
“This shift will further limit any potential exposure with general fund revenue while holding to our commitment to fully fund the fifth year of the Student Opportunity Act,” he said. “This reduction in overall spending will better prepare the commonwealth for potential economic turmoil in the months ahead.”
Senate Ways and Means Chair Michael Rodrigues’ office also cited the unexpectedly high surtax receipts as a factor in the decision to expand its use. 
“In light of higher than initially estimated Fair Share collections, we felt comfortable increasing the conference amount to allow for transformative investments in education and transportation,” said Rodrigues spokesperson Sean Fitzgerald.
Still, critics worry about setting a precedent that allows baseline education costs to be paid for with what was pitched to voters as a tool for innovation.
“While we understand FY2026 presents fiscal challenges, Massachusetts has one of the strongest rainy day funds in the country; reserves that exist precisely to help us sustain progress during hard times,” Imboden said. “Now is the moment to honor the will of the voters and ensure that Fair Share dollars are used to move us forward, not simply to hold the line.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — LGBTQ+ supporters are relaunching a bipartisan advocacy group in an effort to provide a more centrist conversation amid increasingly hateful rhetoric. 
The Equality Network which launched last week aims to change the narrative surrounding LGBTQ+ legislation in an environment that has become “a form of tribalism and partisanship that we’ve never seen,” said Troy Stevenson, executive director of the network. 
By providing a more centrist conversation the network hopes to share the stories of LGBTQ+ Oklahomans and reach across the aisle to generate productive and informed conversation between lawmakers.
“So as Democrats and Republicans and independents …, we intend to move forward in that direction and make sure that we’re going out and having conversations and doing more listening than talking and doing more of everything than judging,” Stevenson said.
The Equality Network, which started in 2009, merged with the Cimarron Alliance Foundation to form Freedom Oklahoma in 2015. Stevenson previously led The Equality Network before launching Freedom Oklahoma to tackle a growing number of anti-LGQBT+ bills being filed in the Legislature.
The resurrected network is focused on presenting policy to the Legislature that contains research and data explaining the positive and negative impacts of the proposed legislation to help spur more informed conversation. 
Stevenson said their work in the upcoming session will focus on “making sure they don’t do anything horrible to our kids.”
Its membership is bipartisan, a move the group hopes will reshape the conversion.
Republican Labor Commissioner Leslie Osborn said her involvement in the network stems from her daughter, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, who moved to Canada because she felt unwelcome. 
“I don’t think that’s acceptable in America,” she said. “Who you love should never have been ingrained in a government issue or political issue.”
In recent years, Oklahoma has seen a growing number of anti-LGBTQ+ measures filed, which range from cracking down on the books children can access in school libraries that contain content regarding sexual sexual lifestyles to banning gender-affirming health care for minors and drag shows in public.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said the core of the network “is about personal freedom, freedom from intolerance, freedom from big government intrusion into someone’s personal life.” 
“Love is love, and people should be free to be their own authentic selves, without big brother government interfering in that life,” he said.
Composed of a two-member staff, The Equality Network, which will be based in Oklahoma City, does not have a finalized budget yet, however, it intends to work with other LGTBQ+ foundations for funding.
Stevenson said they are partnering with Oklahomans for Equality in hopes to host town hall meetings across Oklahoma. 
Oklahomans For Equality did not return messages seeking comment.
Nicole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said they weren’t familiar with the relaunch of The Equality Network.
“There’s always room for more folks fighting for 2SLGBTQ+ liberation in and beyond the Oklahoma Capitol.” McAfee said. “We’re excited to connect with folks seeking new opportunities to engage in the process.”

(Getty Images)TOPEKA — An examination of Sedgwick County’s bail system found practices that exacerbate inequality within the criminal justice system, leading advocates to request change.
A key finding from a recently released report from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas revealed that the county’s bail system “penalizes poverty, perpetuates racial disparities, and undermines the presumption of innocence.”
The report found that the money bail system in Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, results in many people who haven’t yet been convicted of a crime spending more time in jail because they can’t afford to pay for their release ahead of a trial.
Lindsay Callender, a policy associate with the ACLU of Kansas, said pretrial jail time should be reserved for ensuring court appearances, preventing harm to the public and avoiding judicial interference.
“But instead, many people spend up to months behind bars awaiting trial for low-level, nonviolent offenses simply because they can’t post bond, regardless of their guilt or innocence,” Callender said in a news release.
Judges in Kansas often apply bail uniformly, the report said, without consideration for individual circumstances.
The report urged judges to set bonds, the conditions of a person’s release on bail, based not on a set schedule but on individual assessments of flight risk, the danger to the public and financial standing.
The average total bond amount for people charged with crimes in Sedgwick County is more than $104,000, while the average income is less than $90,000. The median income is lower at around $66,000.
The median bond amount for people facing nonviolent charges in Sedgwick County is $1,500, which the report said can be burdensome for low-income groups.
The report found that Sedgwick County’s bail system mostly punishes people accused of committing nonviolent crimes, making up about 84% of all charges awaiting trial. More than half of those charges were tied to procedural violations, which the ACLU attributed to issues of poverty or substance use. Around 15% of the nonviolent charges were drug-related.
Men make up the majority of the population in the Sedgwick County jail. Black individuals make up around one-third of the jail population and about 9% of the county’s general population.
The report said the racial and gender inequalities “in Sedgwick County’s bail system are extreme even by standards of the American justice system.”
It continued: “Black individuals are more likely to be charged, held on bail, held longer, and held on higher amounts. Women, who make up just over a quarter of the incarcerated population, face distinct and compounded hardships, from financial strain to exacerbated mental health challenges.”
A majority of Kansas voters that the ACLU polled statewide in 2023 expressed concern about inequalities in the state’s criminal legal system. More than half of those polled said the system carries “different standards of justice for the rich and the poor.”
Micah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said the issues within Sedgwick County’s bail system didn’t come from nowhere. It is directly tied to “decades of over-policing, surveillance, and disinvestment in vulnerable neighborhoods,” Kubic said.
Bail policy is set by statute in Kansas, leaving change up to legislators. A small handful of states have abolished commercial bail bonds, including Nebraska, and others have implemented reforms, which can include personal recognizance bonds. Those allow someone charged with a crime to be released from jail before a trial, but it is dependent on the person showing up for court.
The report suggested the Sedgwick County District Attorney, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, issue a memo requiring its staff to seek personal recognizance bonds for all defendants charged with crimes that don’t involve other people. Assault, murder and rape would be exempt for this requirement, and the report recommends the office tailor any cash bail amounts to the individual’s circumstances, including ability to pay.
Kubic said elected officials have an opportunity to alleviate cycles of harm within Sedgwick County’s bail system.
“Sedgwick County’s money bail system causes financial destruction, employment disruption, and strain on familial relationships that lead to broader socioeconomic consequences for communities — and it makes all of us less safe,” Kubic said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scales-of-justice-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

(Photo by Chloe Bennett-Steele/StateImpact Oklahoma)In Norman, scientists are working to significantly speed up tornado warnings while finding new paths to understanding deadly storms and protecting lives and property. A cooperative institute with more than 220 employees is studying ways to update weather radar facilities, investigate the dynamics of severe storms and more.
But the years-long research projects are at risk of termination under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) most recent budget estimate.
A document published Monday details the deep funding cuts to the nation’s leading weather and climate agency, which would result in the termination of the National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL) and the University of Oklahoma’s Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO).
StateImpact previously reported that the Trump administration sought to eliminate NOAA’s research arm, which includes the NSSL. The new budget is a detailed version of the passback document released in April. A request for comment from U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, went unanswered. U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin also did not respond.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. James Lankford said he would continue to monitor the budget request during the appropriations process.
“Senator Lankford believes NOAA and the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman do essential work in early detection, forecasting and research,” the spokesperson said in an email.
The latest plan states that a fraction of NSSL research funds would be funneled to the National Weather Service. It’s unclear whether the weather service would use the money for continued research or to cover operational costs.
Two large research projects led by the NSSL would be terminated. The Warn-on-Forecast is creating a system to increase tornado warning lead times, which are usually just a few minutes long. In 2024, the program resulted in a 75-minute lead for residents in Iowa.
The VORTEX USA project is a collaboration between meteorologists and social scientists to determine why tornadoes in the Southeast are more deadly than in other places. The program began in 2015, primarily developed by the NSSL.
“NOAA will evaluate options for supporting these specific activities within the NWS in the future,” the document reads.
Climate research and public information 
The budget request would terminate funding for many organizations focused on climate, weather and oceans. In Norman, the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program works with communities on hazard mitigation plans. The documents are usually stepping stones to getting federal funds after a natural disaster.
The program, located within the National Weather Center, is funded by NOAA grants and would likely be eliminated under the budget proposal.
Climate change is widely targeted throughout the budget request to recenter the agency’s focus on weather, according to the document. But meteorologists say the cuts will likely also disrupt scientists’ understanding of naturally occurring weather patterns.
“By eliminating climate research, we’re eliminating a lot of research that is separate from climate change and has direct societal benefits, like better understanding the El Niño, La Niña phenomenon, being able to understand how to make longer-range monthly to seasonal outlooks,” said Alan Gerard, meteorologist and former NSSL employee. “All of that benefits agriculture, benefits business.”
The news came the same day the website that hosts The National Climate Assessment shut down. The report includes details on how local communities are impacted by warming temperatures and other effects of human-caused climate change.
Both changes reflect the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate federally funded work on climate research.
The final budget will be decided by Congress, which has until the end of September to vote on the spending or provide interim funds for an extension.

Kay Ivey’s office said Wednesday it plans to name a member of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles within the next few days, whether or not that’s Chair Leigh Gwathney.
“The governor is in receipt of the list of nominations. She is reviewing and will make a determination by the Monday deadline,” Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Wednesday.
Gwathney’s fate has become the subject of public contention, with the board’s falling level of parole grants and responsiveness to the Legislature at the center of the discussion.
In a letter released Tuesday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and several sheriffs and prosecutors praised Gwathney and urged Gov. Kay Ivey to reappoint her to another term amid concerns from civil rights groups about declining parole rates and attempts to flaunt oversight from the Legislature.
“Reappointing Leigh Gwathney is about more than leadership — it’s about protecting Alabama families from violent criminals and honoring the voices of victims who too often go unheard,” the letter said. “Ms. Gwathney has never lost sight of what’s at stake: the safety of our citizens and the dignity of those who have suffered at the hands of violent offenders.”
Ivey will choose from a list of candidates submitted by the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives and the Alabama Senate president pro tempore.
Marshall, as well as sheriffs, police chiefs and prosecutors, commended Gwathney’s commitment to public safety.
“More importantly, her willingness to continue to serve in the face of unprecedented and unwarranted criticism by the liberal media shows a level of courage, conviction, and dedication to the cause that is rarely seen in Montgomery,” Marshall said in the letter. “Ms. Gwathney has earned the trust and respect of law enforcement, prosecutors, and crime victims across our state, all of whom now have a stake in seeing her reappointed.”
Gwathney was appointed to the board in 2019 after the Legislature made a series of changes to parole laws following the 2017 release of Jimmy O’Neal Spencer. Spencer, who was misclassified in the system, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2022 of murdering three people during a series of robberies in 2018. The victims included a 7-year-old child. The Legislature enacted a law that set stricter rules and regulations for applicants to be granted parole, especially if they commit violent offenses.
Parole rates have plummeted under Gwathney’s tenure, going from more than 50% in 2017 to 8% in 2023 before increasing to about 26% in 2025.
Criminal justice advocates have criticized the parole board for declining parole rates and not adhering to parole guidelines. The guidelines, though not binding on the board, are meant to serve as a guide for the parole board to follow when making parole determinations.
Along with the declining parole rates, the conformance rate, the frequency with which the parole board follows the guidelines, has also declined to the point that members’ decisions align with the parole guidelines only about a quarter of the time.
At an October meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee, Gwathney struggled to answer direct questions about the parole guidelines and the board’s apparent lack of conformance with them when determining parole.
Over the past year, several lawmakers proposed legislation aimed at reforming the parole board, even going as far as to make funding for the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles contingent on the members adopting updated parole guidelines as required by the law.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_002-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) on the House floor on May 1, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonIn Michigan, where voters in 2022 approved enshrining the right to an abortion into the state constitution, legislation that would classify elective abortions as homicide has been introduced.
Last week, Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced House Bills 4670 and 4671 to create the “justice for babies in the womb act”. The bill aims to adjust all definitions in assault, assault and battery, and homicide cases to apply to “an unborn child in the same manner as they would if the victim were an individual who had been born alive”.
The proposed legislation, which was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, seeks to extend legal personhood to fetuses and fertilized embryos and would allow for women who receive abortions to be charged with homicide. 
The bills would be unlikely to pass through Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate which has approved several measures to implement the constitutional right to reproductive health care, including abortions. However, the legislation has been applauded by anti-abortion advocates, including former Planned Parenthood clinic director turned anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson whose story is the premise of the 2019 movie “Unplanned”.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Another equal protection bill has been introduced in Michigan by @JoshuaSchriver and needs your support!,” Johnson posted on “X”. “It’s time to make our voices heard!!! Abortion is murder! I am proud to support Michigan house bills 4670/4671.”
The bills outline that the unintentional death of a fetus or fertilized embryo would not be subject to the outlined criminal penalties if it were the result of “a life‐saving procedure to save the life of the mother if accompanied by reasonable steps to save the life of the unborn child.”
The Foundation to Abolish Abortion applauded the bills’ introduction in a news release this week with the president of the foundation, Bradley Pierce calling the bills’ “righteous legislation”.
“House Bill 4671 is the first legislation in Michigan state history that would establish equal protection of the laws for preborn children,” Pierce said. “This bill would simply make murdering anyone illegal for everyone, in recognition that preborn babies are image-bearers of God and are just as worthy of legal protection as people who have already been born.
Since 57% of Michigan voters approved the constitutional amendment to add the right to reproductive health care including abortions to the state constitution, there have been unconstitutional efforts to subvert that decision, Chief External Affairs Officer at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan Ashlea Phenicie said in a statement Wednesday.
 “In 2022, Michiganders voted in record numbers to permanently enshrine reproductive freedom into our state constitution… Bills like HB4671 are just empty political grandstanding pushed by anti-abortion extremists who are out-of-step with Michiganders’ values,” Phenicie said. “While it’s unlikely to pass into law, it proves yet again how committed they are to defying the will of voters to control our bodies, lives, and futures.”
Several other states, including Georgia, Indiana, North Dakota and Texas have introduced bills in the same vein.
A request for comment was made by Michigan Advance to Schriver, but has yet to be returned. 
The bills are just the latest attempt by Schriver at rolling back constitutional protections. Earlier this year, he proposed a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage, an effort that ended ignominiously when state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), the first openly gay member of the Michigan Senate, crashed Schriver’s press conference and ended up holding an impromptu session with reporters when Schriver stormed out.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1340-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 15:09:11.119681

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Giovanni Demezier of Davenport was issued an Iowa mental health counselor’s license in May 2021.
The board alleges Demezier began providing counseling services to a female patient, identified in board records as T.S., in January 2024. The counseling sessions took place in the patient’s home and at some point during the counseling relationship, Demezier allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with the patient.
According to the board, the patient alleges that after the two engaged in sexual relations, Demezier told her he needed to switch her from counseling to coaching services and had her sign a new contract for such services — implying that this made their sexual relationship permissible.

Demezier further stated to that it was “normal” to engage in sexual relationships with clients and that he “does it all the time,” the board alleges.
T.S. later became pregnant and believes Demezier is the father. Demezier allegedly provided money to T.S. to terminate the pregnancy, but it was too late for such a procedure once she discovered she was pregnant, according to the board.
The board states that Demezier was interviewed and admitted to having sexual contact with T.S.
Court records indicate Demezier worked for Davenport’s QC Counselor at the time of the alleged relationship. Police records indicate T.S. provided police with screenshots of text conversations with Demezier that included references to sexual activity, a pregnancy, and the change in their relationship from counselor to coach.
The police records also indicate QC Counselor said, in response to a subpoena, that Demezier had left the company on Aug. 21, 2024, and that he had retained all client records upon his departure.
On May 14, 2025, police executed a search warrant at Demezier’s residence and seized a laptop computer from his home office. The laptop was then sent to Johnson County Joint Forensic Analysis Cyber Team in Coralville for forensic examination.
No criminal charges have been filed in the case.
Board: Advances made toward second patient 
The Board of Behavioral Health Professionals also alleges that in 2021, Demezier began counseling services with a previous client, M.R., via telehealth sessions.
Approximately two years into the counseling relationship, Demezier introduced the idea of switching M.R. from counseling to coaching, claiming it would be more affordable, according to the board.
On Aug. 2, 2023, the patient became a client of Demezier’s private practice, after which Demezier allegedly encouraged her to communicate with him more frequently via his personal cellphone. According to the board, Demezier assured M.R. the rules were different given their new coaching relationship.
According to the board, M.R. claims that on Oct. 28, 2024, Demezier initiated a sexual conversation with her via text message. “The patient felt scared, trapped, and intimidated by the situation and the sexual comments” made by Demezier, the board alleges. She terminated the relationship with Demezier via email message on Oct. 31, 2024.
In connection with the allegations involving T.S. and M.R, the board has charged Demezier with improper sexual contact with a patient or making suggestive or lewd remarks or advances to a patient; failure to comply with a national code of ethics, and engaging in sexual activities or sexual contact with a client.
The board recently concluded Demezier had engaged in sexual contact with a client and engaged in improper sexual behavior toward a second client, making him “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.”
As a result, the board has issued an emergency order immediately suspending his license. Additional action may be taken after a hearing on the charges has been held.

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Justice Department attorneys told a federal district judge Tuesday that the Trump administration will not impose proposed restrictions on birthright citizenship for a month — but that it reserves the right to “immediately” start planning for that day.
The two-page notice was filed in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, in response to District Judge Deborah Boardman’s demand a day earlier to know “if the government thinks that it can start removing children from the United States who are subject to the terms of the executive order.”
It is the latest twist in a months-long legal battle over an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, his first day back in office, that sought to deny citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of their parents was a citizen or a permanent legal resident.
Historically, “birthright” citizenship has been granted to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parent’s status. But Trump claimed in his executive order that that was a misinterpretation of the law, which he claimed was never intended to apply to everyone.

The order was almost immediately challenged in court by groups that said birthright citizenship is a bedrock of U.S democracy, and that denying citizenship to a child born here could make the child stateless altogether. Judges in three different districts, including Boardman, agreed and issued nationwide injunctions to block the order.
The government appeal focused on whether the district court judges had the authority to impose a nationwide ban on the order. In a 6-3 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the judges should not have extended the injunction beyond those people and groups that brought the suits.
But the high court’s ruling noted that a class-action suit could apply nationally. That’s why the plaintiffs in the Maryland case — CASA, the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project at 15 women who are pregnant or new mothers — were back in court Monday, seeking to get their suit certified as a class action suit for all undocumented parents and their babies.
The Supreme Court sent the cases back to the district court, but also set July 27 as the earliest date the administration can apply the executive order, to allow time for the cases to be reheard. On Monday, Boardman ordered Trump’s attorneys to clarify in writing the government’s view of what it can do under the executive order, and when.
Trump’s attorneys agreed in the filing that the earliest date the administration would apply the order is, in fact, July 27. But the the court’s ruling also provided for a 30-day ramp-up period, the notice said.
“The Court’s stay thus allows Defendants to immediately begin to ‘develop[] and issu[e] public guidance about the Executive’s plans to implement the Executive Order,’” the filing reads.
Boardman also gave Trump’s lawyers until July 7 to file a response to the plaintiffs’ motion to turn the case into a class action lawsuit.

The lawsuit says federal agents are stopping people only for being Latino, placing them in ‘deplorable conditions’ and not allowing them to speak with an attorney. 



A lawsuit filed Wednesday by civil and immigration rights groups accuses federal authorities of unleashing an unconstitutional siege by snatching workers and U.S. citizens off Southern California streets and denying them food, water and the right to speak with an attorney. 
The federal class action lawsuit aims to immediately stop immigration agents from conducting military-style raids across L.A. that prioritize “numbers, pure numbers,” according to the complaint. It also seeks to get access to counsel for those arrested who are now being held in overcrowded “dungeon-like” facilities where the conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional, the filing says.  
Federal agents in combat gear, some masked and armed with rifles, have stormed swap meets, car washes, bus stops, and churches since early June, grabbing people off sidewalks and dragging away mothers, workers, day laborers, and U.S. citizens without explanation, the complaint alleges. Civil rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, say the raids have been part of an illegal mass-arrest campaign driven by the Trump administration’s nationwide deportation quota policy. 
“Such seizures look less like lawful arrests and more like brazen, midday kidnappings,” the lawsuit states.  
In late May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller issued a directive to Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make 3,000 immigration-related arrests every day, and stated there would be “consequences for not hitting arrest targets,” the lawsuit says, referencing a story in the Wall Street Journal. 
“Since early June, this District has been under siege,” the complaint states. The lawsuit is brought by the ACLU, Public Counsel, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, among others. It names Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol, and the FBI as defendants. 
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the raids have been “highly targeted.”
“Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,” she wrote in an email. “These type (sic) of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement. This kind of garbage has led to a more than 700 percent increase in the assaults on enforcement officers. Politicians, activists, and “journalists” must turn the temperature down and tone down their rhetoric.”
Federal officials made similar claims about similar raids conducted in Kern County in January. After the ACLU challenged the raids in court, a federal judge later found they likely violated the Constitution’s ban on unreasonable searches, issuing a preliminary injunction banning those raids in the Central Valley. 
The new suit makes the same arguments about the Los Angeles raids. 
‘They don’t care if you have papers’ 
Filed on behalf of five individuals and four advocacy groups, including the United Farm Workers, the filing documents a sprawling crackdown that has targeted dozens of locations across Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties, terrorizing mostly Latino neighborhoods in the process. Among those locations are at least 15 Home Depot parking lots, nine car washes, a Santa Ana park, a swap meet in Santa Fe Springs, and several churches. 
The suit argues that agents are detaining people solely based on their race, clothing or occupation, which would be a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. 
“They don’t care if you have papers, as long as you look like what they want you to look like, they’ll take you,” recalled one witness who saw agents take away a dark-skinned man who only spoke Spanish from the Downey Memorial Christian Church on June 11. 
Another witness said she saw federal agents pulling people from the bathrooms during a military-style raid at a popular Los Angeles swap meet with 60 heavily armed agents. Videos taken from the scene of that crackdown show armed agents dressed in camouflage, some of whom wore masks concealing their identities. Border Patrol made a video boasting about its actions there. 
“If you looked Hispanic in any way, they just took you,” the witness said, according to the complaint. 
In Culver City, agents descended on a car wash on June 8 dressed in either camouflage fatigues or plainclothes, driving unmarked cars. One witness saw an agent carrying an assault rifle while running after a customer across a four-lane road. Other terrified customers shouted, “Don’t shoot!” In Westchester, that same day, armed agents in camouflage and helmets tackled a fruit vendor to the ground, according to the suit. 
In Orange County, on June 6, agents surrounded and questioned Latino men painting a house while ignoring white neighbors in nearby yards. 
U.S. citizens taken
Among those detained was Heidi Plummer, a U.S. citizen who got caught up in an immigration raid while taking a walk through a park in Santa Ana on June 14. She was handcuffed, put in a vehicle with others, and taken to a station and held for an hour and a half before she was released, the complaint states. 
Andrea Velez, another U.S. citizen, was being dropped off at work in downtown Los Angeles when she was grabbed without explanation and without anyone asking her for her identification. Her mother, who witnessed the attack, said it looked like “they’re kidnapping her.” 
“The only thing wrong with her … was the color of her skin,” said her mother, according to the lawsuit. 
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege federal agents have no prior information about the people they’re detaining, nor any warrants. They allege the agents are arresting people without considering whether or not they pose a flight risk before a warrant can be obtained, in violation of federal law. They also claim the agents are not identifying themselves or telling people why they’re being arrested, also in violation of federal law. 
Detention ‘conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional’ 
ICE detention capacity is buckling under the surge in arrests, causing the agency to hold people in a basement area in Los Angeles known as “B-18.” The basement is meant to be a short-term processing center for ICE, but now people are facing prolonged confinement there without access to attorneys, according to the complaint. The Immigration and Nationality Act says people have the right to call an attorney while in immigration detention. 
There, detainees have reported having little access to food or water. They say the holding areas have been so crowded that there hasn’t been space to sit or lay down. 
“In these dungeon-like facilities, conditions are deplorable and unconstitutional,” the complaint states. Facing the awful conditions at that site and others, some people have been pressured into accepting “voluntary departure,” the complaint says, which helps federal authorities continue to arrest more people. 
McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, denied the accusations in the lawsuit about conditions inside ICE facilities. 
“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false. In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,” McLaughlin said.
McLaughlin said all detainees are provided proper meals that are certified by dieticians, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.   
“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she added. 
The 65-page complaint asks the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to block federal immigration agents from continuing the raids, declare their tactics unconstitutional, and allow access to counsel for those who have been swept up and detained. 
“Despite the fear and risks associated with speaking publicly,” the lawsuit says, the plaintiffs are “taking courageous action to enforce the rule of law.” 
The organizations that are part of the lawsuit are: the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The legal team includes attorneys from the ACLU of Southern California, ACLU NorCal, LA-based Public Counsel, and UC Irvine School of Law Immigrant and Racial Justice Solidarity Clinic.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062025_ICE-Raid_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

This story was originally published by ProPublica. 
One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.
“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
Without explanation, EPA restores some grants for PFAS research in Maine

The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”
Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-DrinkingWater-PFAS-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

According to the division, reservoir levels around the state remain at about 8% higher than normal for this time of the year. In northern Utah, Strawberry, Deer Creek, Jordanelle, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Echo, East Canyon and Pineview reservoirs are all at about 90% capacity or higher. 
As of Wednesday, the Great Salt Lake was at about 4,192 feet in elevation, slightly below the state’s “ecologically healthy” level of 4,198 feet. Utah Lake was at about 91% capacity. 
Hot and windy weather prompts statewide fire restrictions and a call for prayer

But with the drought worsening and peak summer temperatures still ahead, water levels in the state’s lakes and reservoirs are expected to drop. 
“Right now, we’re generally seeing outflows from reservoirs begin to exceed inflows,” Hasenyager said. “That pattern typically sets in later in the summer, but this year’s heat is accelerating things. Across all sectors, we need to look for ways to be efficient with our finite water supply.”
The drought prompted Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to declare a state of emergency in 17 counties earlier this spring
The executive order allows farmers and ranchers to access low-interest loans from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. Agricultural producers in Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Piute, San Juan, Sanpete, Sevier, Tooele, Uintah, Washington and Wayne counties can apply to receive up to $100,000, with loans available until the end of October. 
The drought is also contributing to the high fire danger in Utah. So far this year, the state has seen more than 52,000 acres burned in 438 fires. 
That includes the Forsyth Fire, which as of Wednesday afternoon was at about 13,419 acres and 42% contained, and the 33,362-acre France Canyon Fire, which is now 64% contained.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.,"The U.S. Capitol on Sunday, June 29, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate narrowly passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote.
Senators voted 51-50, mostly along party lines. All Democrats voted in opposition, as well as three Republicans.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026, deviated from party leadership to cast a vote in the negative.
The measure, if passed, would make drastic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP benefits, and student loan payment programs, to name a few components.
Here’s a look at how North Carolina’s congressional delegation is responding to the bill moving forward.
Tillis goes against his party
Tillis, a moderate Republican, joined fellow GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky to stray from party lines and vote against the bill.
He specifically voiced concern over the bill’s impact on Medicaid, saying the Senate draft contains “significant” changes that would be “devastating” to North Carolina.
“I did my homework on behalf of North Carolinians, and I cannot support this bill in its current form,” he wrote on social media.
Tillis added that the bill would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for the Tar Heel State, including in hospitals and rural communities.
Facing a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate, Tillis revealed just days before the vote that he would retire instead of running for reelection next year.
The move sets off a battle for the open seat in both major parties. Lara Trump and Roy Cooper appear to be frontrunners, but neither have declared their candidacy thus far.
Democrats rally against the measure
Rep. Alma Adams, representing North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, proposed an amendment to the budget bill on Wednesday as it appeared on the House floor.
The amendment “protects against any cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Adams said, asking to bring it in front of the chamber.
“The unanimous consent request cannot be entertained,” Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said, shutting it down as he presided over the body.
Adams shared on social media about how Republicans “wouldn’t entertain” her amendment.
“We are going to keep fighting this One Big, Ugly Bill,” she wrote.
Rep. Deborah Ross of North Carolina’s second congressional district said she was back in Washington to vote against the bill.
It would “strip food assistance, health care, climate change support all from the American people and give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” she said in a video she posted online.
Ross pointed out that Vance had to vote on the topic.
“Even our Senator Thom Tillis could see through what this is going to do to people’s health care,” she said.
Other Republicans continue to back the measure
Aside from Tillis, North Carolina’s congressional Republicans have voiced their support for the budget bill.
Rep. Richard Hudson of the ninth congressional district has been one of the most vocal members from the state to defend the measure.
Hudson sent off a flurry of posts online outlining claims that Democrats are working against the American people.
He posted a series of messages saying, “if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn’t pass, it will have disastrous effects on…” ending with the economy, border security, national security, and fiscal trajectory.
“Today, House Republicans will vote to prevent the largest tax increase in American history,” Hudson posted Wednesday morning.
Gov. Josh Stein urges opposition
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein issued a letter on Wednesday to the North Carolina congressional delegation asking members to vote against the legislation.
He explicitly highlighted his “deep concern” for changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and tax credits for energy and manufacturing.
Stein said the bill poses both immediate and long-term threats to the health and wellbeing of North Carolinians, as well as the state’s economic stability.
“This bill has moved at a breakneck pace, leaving North Carolinians without ample time to provide feedback on the devastating impacts this would have on our state,” he wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoljune292025_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

Memorial funds for the two killed firefighters, a support fund for the injured firefighter, and to the nonprofit Red & Blue Foundation that supports first responders and their families, are available online at the International Association of Fire Fighters’ website, at iaff.org/Idaho-LODD.
The firefighters killed were Battalion Chief John Morrison, 52, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, 42, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue. The injured firefighter is Dave Tysdal, who works for the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.

“Every contribution made through these official channels goes directly toward supporting the families in their time of unimaginable loss and need,” the Professional Firefighters of Idaho said in a news release.
The brush fire officials believe the suspect caused, named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, grew to 38 acres by Tuesday morning, largely because of better mapping, the Idaho Department of Lands reported. The fire is not contained.
The U.S. Forest Service on Tuesday closed roads near Canfield Mountain until July 15, unless the order ends earlier. A temporary flight restriction is still in effect for the area. Flying drones or aircraft in the area without authorization poses “a serious hazard to firefighting and law enforcement activities,” Idaho Department of Lands officials say.
Structures are still not at risk from the fire, and no evacuations have been ordered, Department of Lands officials say. The fire is in steep terrain.
Crews on Tuesday will work to contain the fire by installing hose lays and setting up water access for the fire’s perimeter, officials say. Fire operations on Tuesday also changed from the Idaho Department of Lands’ Mica Fire Protection District to the North Idaho Type 3 Incident Management Team.
The active shooter situation Sunday delayed firefighting efforts. The fire’s cause remains under investigation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-02 17:51:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT employee union takes Lamont to arbitration after no raise offer,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/02/ct-employee-union-ned-lamont-arbitration/,"After the unit announced its plans, SEBAC said it ‘would not expect a single one of our units to accept’ Lamont’s wage freeze proposal.","While weighing a third term, Gov. Ned Lamont asked a key part of his political base — unionized state employees — to accept a wage freeze despite his administration projecting the second-largest budget surplus in Connecticut history.
The 1,300-member Judicial Professional Employees Union announced arbitration plans Wednesday afternoon and is one of just 35 state bargaining units working under contracts that expired Tuesday. But other worker groups, which still are negotiating with the Lamont administration, are expected to have received similar no-raise proposals.
“Negotiation teams representing their colleagues have been working tirelessly at each of the 35 bargaining tables to reach agreement on successor contracts that address pay and other issues,” Drew Stoner, spokeswoman of the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC, wrote in a statement. “However, after months of bargaining, our first unit has declared impasse.”
Stoner added the judicial professionals’ union, which represents probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, had asked for a 2.5% cost-of-living increase in the new fiscal year that began Tuesday, as well as a step hike for all but the most senior workers. A step hike typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise. This would match the increase Lamont negotiated, and legislators approved this past May, for state police troopers.
SEBAC, which includes all major state employee unions excluding the troopers’ unit, added that the administration’s offer for judicial professions “was no wage increase, no step, and no top step payment. We would not expect a single one of our units to accept this offer.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Wednesday, “The administration plans to present an offer to SEBAC regarding wages and work conditions as soon as next week. … Governor Lamont immensely values the contributions of our state employees, as evidenced by consistent wage increases and our offer will reflect that.”
Since Lamont became governor in 2019, his administration largely has negotiated matching pay hikes for all state employee unions.
And since 2021, as Connecticut has enjoyed unprecedented surpluses driven by aggressive and increasingly controversial budget caps, most unionized workers have received effective annual raises of 4.5%. That reflects a 2.5% cost of living adjustment and a yearly step increase.
Since those budget caps last were set in 2017, annual surpluses have averaged $1.8 billion, a huge sum that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. And the governor’s budget office projected two weeks ago that Connecticut would close the 2024-25 fiscal year with nearly $2.2 billion or 10% left over.
Though the outgoing fiscal year closed on Monday, the comptroller’s office won’t complete a final audit until September.
Despite those surpluses, and projections for more black ink in the next few years, the governor and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority adopted a new, $55.8 billion, biennial budget that assumed most unionized employees would not be getting their raises on time this July 1.
Legislators struggled to find enough room under the constitutional spending cap — which keeps most budget growth in line with household income and inflation — to cover raises and planned new investments in child care, municipal aid and education.
The expectation, though, was that workers still would receive an increase for the 2025-26 fiscal year, but that it would be delivered retroactively in 2026-27, when there would be more projected room to spend under the constitutional cap.
But despite the large surpluses, Lamont and state officials also are wary that Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual Medicaid payments and other grants from Washington, D.C., as part of ongoing efforts by Congress and President Donald J. Trump to slash federal spending.Critics say budget caps were calibrated arbitrarily and the huge, post-2017 “surpluses” don’t reflect non-essential resources, but rather vital dollars stripped from education, health care, and other core programs to build state reserves and reduce Connecticut’s considerable pension debt.
The state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Those obligations, coupled with bonded debt and funds owed to other retirement benefits programs, collectively approach $79 billion, making Connecticut one of the most indebted states, per capita, in the nation.
But much of that debt was due to poor savings habits over seven decades, between 1939 and 2010. And given that pension debt — even at the current pace Connecticut is paying it down — is projected to place pressure on state finances well into the 2040s, critics say Lamont is placing too much pressure on one generation to solve a problem created by three.
State employee unions have been some of the most vocal critics of those caps, and say they’ve led to dangerous understaffing levels in many agencies and departments.
“Our state workforce is the backbone of public safety, infrastructure, education and health — and the first line of defense when federal resources are held back,” Stoner added. “Yet with no contract in place, Lamont is asking workers to hold the line with one hand tied behind their backs. … Governor Lamont must recognize this reality and empower his representatives to  agree to fair and honorable contracts.”
The governor, a fiscal moderate, is expected to announce later this summer whether he will run in 2026 for a third term in office.
At a June 5 press conference, one day after the General Assembly closed the regular 2024 session, the governor gave his strongest indication to date of an inclination to seek another four-year term with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.
“I love the job,” he said. “I think we’ve had extraordinary progress compared to where we were, say, 10 years ago. I think Susan and I are a pretty good team.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC03422-e1541205352185.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Courtesy of Angel Peña) A U.S. Customs and Border Protection proposal to construct a 1.3-mile barrier along the southern skirt of a Sunland Park mountain threatens the area, local conservation groups say.
Most of Mount Cristo Rey lies in southern Doña Ana County, rising from the banks of the Rio Grande in an expanse of Chihuahuan desert, mottled with olive-green chaparral and ocotillo. The mountain hosts a 29-foot tall limestone statue of Jesus Christ on the cross, and draws thousands of people every year in pilgrimage from the surrounding areas in Las Cruces, El Paso and Juárez. The area is also a popular hiking and mountain biking area.
The proposal would widen roads to construct a 30-foot high steel barrier and an additional one and a half miles of roadway in Doña Ana County. The wall would stretch over the mountain’s southern portion, which stretches to the Anapra neighborhood in Juárez.

In announcing the project at the start of June, the Department of Homeland Security said it would “close critical gaps in the border wall and enhance border security operations” in the border areas in El Paso, Tucson and Yuma.
When reached by phone, CBP spokesperson Landon Hutchison added that Mount Cristo Rey “was a major human smuggling infiltration site for the cartels.”

Also in June, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem waived federal environment and water laws to speed up border wall construction projects, including more than 12 miles between Santa Teresa and Mount Cristo Rey. The waivers exempt projects from requirements of 24 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) whose district encompasses Sunland Park, declined to say if he supports the project when reached for comment.
“I support responsible efforts to keep our border secure and our communities safe. That includes smart investments in technology and, where needed, physical barriers,” Vasquez said in a written statement. “We can keep our country safe while also respecting the environment, cultural heritage, and the people who call this region home.”










“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard”


– Dr. Brian Elmore, El Paso emergecy room doctor


Members of El Paso-Las Cruces coalition No Border Walls on Mount Cristo Rey, however, urged the public to submit public comments on the project  — which they say threatens to worsen migrant deaths, erosion and habitat loss for the area — before a July 3 feedback deadline.
While CBP data shows border crossings declined by nearly 80% in the last year, deaths of people crossing the border in the area around El Paso and New Mexico have risen sharply since 2021, and, in 2024, it became the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

“It is pretty disheartening to see,” Antoinette Reyes, the Southern New Mexico coordinator for Sierra Club Rio Grande chapter, told Source NM. “By blocking off that section, which is already steep and difficult terrain as is, it forces people to go into more dangerous portions of the border to cross.”
Injuries from climbing over the walls can result in life-changing injuries, said Dr. Brian Elmore, an emergency room physician in El Paso. He’s treated people who fell from the border walls, which can cause severe ankle breaks, as well as head and back injuries. The summer’s heat, combined with difficult terrain, could pose additional concerns, he said.
“I think by expanding the border wall, you threaten to turn this place of recreation, this place of worship, into a graveyard,” Elmore said. “I would expect to see more people falling from the wall there, suffering heat injuries, in this area.”

Construction of the border wall would also require high water use for pouring concrete to reinforce the roads for heavy machinery, said Erik Meza, a coordinator for the Sierra Club Borderlands program in Tucson.
“They will probably need to widen some of those roads, so that means that they are going to start bulldozing some of the native vegetation of the area, reducing a habitat for species,” he said. “By compacting the soils, we’re probably going to have more water run-off and erosion.”
The area is crucial for species such as javelina and mule deer, but also the birds, reptiles and pollinators that cross the habitat, said Raymundo Aguilar, a member of the Juárez conservation group Colectivo Sierra de Juárez. He noted that scientists documented an endangered Mexican Gray wolf crossing the border in the area in 2017, and the construction of a wall with 4-inch gaps between steel bollards would prevent most species from moving freely.
“Protecting this corridor is not only urgent; it is a commitment to the life we share on both sides of the border,” Aguilar said in Spanish. “We believe that efforts should focus on restoring this connectivity, not fragmenting it.”

Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.

The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.

Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.

Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:32:45+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Everybody loves John’: Jackson mayor Horhn’s big party brings in big bucks,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/everybody-loves-john-jackson-mayor-horhns-big-party-brings-in-big-bucks/,Tuesday's gala was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Jackson Mayor John Horhn's inauguration festivities.,"By Tuesday evening, the room where Jackson Mayor John Horhn took the oath of office between gospel performances by the Mississippi Mass Choir earlier in the day had transformed into a glittery gala, replete with a red carpet, lit candles and a classically raunchy gig by blues musician Bobby Rush.
It was a spectacular party that helped generate half a million dollars in sponsorships for Tuesday’s inauguration festivities. More than 140 sponsors across Jackson made monetary and in-kind donations to celebrate Horhn, a longtime state senator from northwest Jackson, finally attaining the office he’d sought for 16 years.
“What better way to kick off and put the cap on such a monumental day, a momentous day, than to come out to the Jackson Convention Center and throw a party,” Horhn said after he took the stage.
All told, Horhn’s inauguration committee raised more than $485,000 in cash sponsorships and $150,000 in write-off donations to organize yesterday’s events, including the bash that was free and open to the public and featured food from more than 20 local businesses and a pricey cash bar. 
While the final tally of what was spent yesterday or how many people attended isn’t complete, Jeff Good, a local restaurateur who oversaw the committee’s finances, said he had budgeted about $320,000 for the day and estimated 2,500 attendees. Horhn will be able to use any leftover funds to put on future events. 
Each sponsor had a different motivation for donating, Good said. Some were local companies who have sought city contracts, while other Jacksonians made financial contributions simply because they are fans of Horhn. 
“There’s so many things that John has done,” Good said at the gala. “Everybody loves John.” 
While past mayors have thrown similar balls upon their inauguration, Horhn’s party was especially well-attended and inclusive, multiple attendees said. 
In the weeks leading up to the gala, the inauguration committee circulated a digital chart inviting people to sponsor the event at different levels from the lowest tier, called “spark” at a minimum of $500, all the way up to the “drum major” at $15,000 or more. 
Sponsors were to make the checks out to a 501(c)4 set up by the inauguration committee, Good said, and send them to a P.O. Box managed by Willie Bozeman, Horhn’s chief of staff and interim campaign manager. 
What did the sponsors get in exchange for their contribution? Good pointed at gigantic screens on either side of the gala’s main stage that listed the sponsor’s names. 
“We read their names on the podium,” he said. “They get the notoriety that they supported the mayor. It’s no different than if you’re doing a charity ball.” 
Sponsors also got dedicated tables, an invitation to a VIP reception, a swag bag and acknowledgement in the event program — a list that reads like a who’s who of Jackson and included developers like the Mattiace Company and Gabriel Prado, prominent law firms such as Butler Snow, nonprofits, lobbyists, engineering firms and well-known city construction contractors. 
“When you read the sponsorship list in our program, it is Jackson businesses, Jackson families, Jackson couples,” Good said. 
Cynics might say these donations will be used to get the mayor’s ear down the road.  
“Some folks are doing it to reap the benefits of contracts,” said David Archie, a former Hinds County commissioner recently hired by former Mayor Chokwe Lumumba after running for mayor himself, as he was looking for a table to sit at. “Some folks are doing it to be on the staff or to have family members on the staff.” 
But many others felt their sponsorship was more akin to a “thank you.” Carla Kirkland, the chief executive officer of an education consulting company that works with Jackson Public Schools, said she didn’t need to donate to get Horhn’s attention — she’s known him since he was a senator. 
Instead, Kirkland said she donated $15,000 to show Horhn that she has his back, much more than she’s given past mayoral administrations. 
“I think it shows the support that we are showing for the new administration and just letting them know that we are behind you,” she said. “We will put our money behind you, and we will put our name behind you.” 
Kirkland went even further, helping to fundraise for the gala, which she said was easy to do. Through her group chat network, she said she sold over 100 “spark” sponsorships. 
“I am in a GroupMe with the AKAs, with the Jack and Jills … with Women for Progress,” she said. “So I just pulled together my network.” 
The gala also proved to be a good networking opportunity: While talking to a reporter, Kirkland spotted Errick Greene, the Jackson Public Schools superintendent.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-02 17:25:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,Ridgeland nonprofit joins lawsuit over EPA’s funding pause,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/02/ridgeland-nonprofit-joins-lawsuit-over-epas-funding-pause/,Ridgeland nonprofit has joined a national lawsuit over EPA-terminated grants focused on climate resilience.,"2C Mississippi, a Ridgeland-based nonprofit focused on climate resilience in Mississippi, recently joined a national lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency after the government terminated over $20 million in grant funds for the organization.
In February, the lawsuit says, the EPA followed directives from President Trump to cut federal spending by terminating grants for a variety of environmental justice and climate resilience projects. Lawyers from a number of groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, filed the complaint in federal court in Washington D.C. on June 25. The complaint asks for full funding of the roughly 350 awarded grants impacted by the EPA’s cuts.
The Ridgeland organization, federal data shows, was set to receive about $20.5 million for two projects in Jackson: $20 million for a self-sustainable “resilience hub” and $500,000 to complete a “microparks” project aimed at tackling flooding and blight in the city. 2C Mississippi, one of the over 20 plaintiffs from around the country, received just $300,000 of those funds so far.
In a March memo the EPA sent to 2C Mississippi, the agency wrote, “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
Dominika Parry, who founded the nonprofit in 2017, called it a “nearly impossible task” to obtain the $20 million elsewhere for the resilience hub, a concept she said is growing around the country, such as in New Orleans. The idea, she explained, is to provide shelter both during emergencies but also during general times of need.

“ This is a place where people can come, stay overnight, have access to energy, be in healthy conditions,” Parry said. 
Features would include a tornado shelter, 150 beds, showers and charging stations, as well as job training and community spaces. Parry added the facility would be self-sustainable with an independent well water system as well as solar panels with battery storage. Working with Jackson nonprofit Voice of Calvary Ministries, Parry secured a site for the hub at a former church in west Jackson. 
The microparks project, which she discussed with Mississippi Today last year, seeks to take on both blight and flooding by turning dilapidated properties in flood zones into communal green spaces with public art and gardens. Despite having already selected the locations and cleared the land for the parks to live in, Parry said she’s had to pause the project since the EPA’s termination. She was optimistic that funding could come from elsewhere, but it’s unclear how long that would take. 
Without the grant money, Parry’s unsure if her organization as a whole can survive. Already, she said, she’s had to start working for free as well as reduce her employee’s salaries. 
“Losing that funding is a pretty existential change to our functioning,” she said.
In a separate project, 2C Mississippi secured a $1.5 million federal grant for a recently unveiled green space on Farish Street.
“So far we’ve been incredibly grateful and lucky that we were able to keep delivering and build trust, and now the idea we are going to go and tell people we don’t have the funds, that weighs on me,” Parry said. “People in Jackson have been promised many, many things that never happened.”
Other Mississippi groups whose grants were terminated include the Gulfport-based Steps Coalition and Jackson State University. Steps Coalition, according to federal data, received just $122,000 of a $500,000 grant to engage residents in local land-use and leadership training. JSU received about $60,000 of $100,000 from two EPA grants to train water technicians, support grant writing in underserved communities, and provide water to a garden at Blackburn Middle School in Jackson.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/05115716/Farish-Street-Green-Commons-6.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Photo byArielle Robinson / Verite News)Tulane University is no longer pursuing disciplinary action against seven students who were originally facing consequences for their participation in an off-campus protest advocating for Columbia student activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released from immigration detention in Louisiana.
The students announced on June 9 that the school had dismissed the charges.
The protest took place on March 11 near Tulane University and proceeded peacefully as participants called for both Tulane and Loyola universities to take action against deportation and recent actions taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Rory Macdonald, one of the seven students, said that initially receiving the charges was devastating.
“It was a terrible overreach on Tulane’s part,” Macdonald said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Macdonald and some other students went through a similar disciplinary process after participating in an encampment at Tulane during the spring of 2024, which resulted in a semester-long suspension.
“We tried to fight [those suspensions] too, and we weren’t successful,” Macdonald said. “But I think that what’s different here is that we had the legal support that really let us show them, this will not stand.”
After the protest, the Office of Student Conduct sent emails to the students informing them of their charges, including “failure to comply,” “disruptive conduct,” and “acting in collusion to violate the Code of Conduct.”
According to a letter written by legal counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the students were told that their actions were not protected by the university’s freedom of expression policy because of their association with Tulane Students for a Democratic Society, a student group that was suspended from campus after organizing the spring 2024 encampment.
Cameron McLaren, one of the students who was facing charges, told Verite News in an email that she believes the university was operating politically without explicitly saying so.
“The school was trying to police our affiliation with a national organization and hid their motives by retroactively enforcing copyright/branding rules,” McLaren wrote.
FIRE, a nonprofit organization focused on protecting free speech, criticized Tulane for penalizing the students for protesting off-campus.
“Once an organization is no longer affiliated with the university, Tulane has no further interest in prohibiting students from associating with the group off campus, just as it has no interest in barring membership in any other local political organization, sports league, or theater ensemble,” the letter reads.
Zach Greenberg, a lawyer with FIRE, told Verite that the organization is involved with hundreds of cases regarding free speech on college campuses each year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re glad to see that Tulane dropped the charges and did the right thing,” Greenberg said. “However, the charges should never have been brought to begin with. The universities, before they bring these charges, should understand what free speech protects and refrain from punishing students for exercising their rights.”
According to Macdonald, the process of disciplinary hearings typically involve Tulane’s legal representatives asking students questions in a format similar to that of a legal deposition.
“It’s a very one-sided process and we fought to change the process,” Macdonald said. “We eventually were able to get a meeting between the students who were under attack, faculty who were supporting them and the dean of students.”
Leading up to these meetings, the students asked members of the public to call into the dean of students’ office and express their concerns about penalizing the students. In their second meeting with administrators, the students were informed that the charges were being dismissed.
Tulane has not made a public statement about the reasoning behind the charges being dropped. Macdonald said that the students were not given any additional information regarding the decision when it was made.
Tulane spokesperson Michael Strecker said that the university cannot comment on individual conduct cases. In a written statement provided to Verite, Strecker emphasized that Tulane’s conduct process is “educational in nature.”
“There are multiple paths for resolving cases, ranging from major matter investigations to informal resolution processes,” Strecker wrote. “The path any individual student’s case takes may change along the way based on the information provided and available.”
McLaren was relieved when the charges were dropped because it meant that she could graduate this past May as planned, with a degree in psychology and computer science.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I knew that the decision wasn’t due to Tulane having a change of heart; rather, we ran a successful political defense campaign,” she wrote, referring to the letter from FIRE and calls from the public.
Macdonald, who will be returning to Tulane in the fall to finish their studies as a history major, says that they are still concerned about the state of free speech on campus.
“We won the right to keep organizing Tulane students off-campus, but a lot of us feel like we need to keep fighting until there is actually some measure of free speech on campus,” they said. “The only way we can make any progress in our universities is to be loud and public about it.”

Phil Murphy in 2025. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, is entering the general election season with a double-digit lead over her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, according to a new Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Wednesday.
The first major gubernatorial poll since the June primary shows Sherrill with 51% of voters’ support, and Ciattarelli with 31%, if the Nov. 4 election were held today.
Including voters who lean toward a candidate, her lead grows by one point. About 3% say they’d vote neither, and 6% are uncertain.
While Sherrill holds a comfortable edge, the poll also suggests economic issues could take front and center to narrow the race as November approaches. Pollsters also found “an intense national political landscape” will have an impact yet to be seen, and that this gap will likely shrink in the next several months.
“Early polling on the governor’s race should serve as a baseline or a barometer of how voters are feeling in the moment — not as some crystal ball predicting the future four months from now,” said Ashley Koning, an assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling. “A lot can happen between now and November.”
She said 2021 showed how much a race can shift in just a few months. Ciattarelli, who was also the GOP gubernatorial candidate then, narrowly lost to Gov. Phil Murphy in a closer-than-expected race. Polls had showed Murphy ahead by double digits, but he only won by about three points.
President Donald Trump remains a looming presence in the race, with 52% of voters polled saying Trump plays a “major factor” in their vote, Wednesday’s poll showed. Nearly three-quarters of Sherrill supporters cited Trump as a top concern, compared to 27% of Ciattarelli backers.
Koning noted that while Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli may have boosted him in the primaries, these numbers are “an early sign” that the endorsement could play out differently in the general election.
“Trump’s influence appears to be more of a benefit to Sherrill right now,” said Koning.
With four months to go, both campaigns are battling for the bloc of independent voters that could sway the race. Sherrill, whose name recognition and favorability has surged since April, has been seen as the more moderate candidate between the two, according to the poll.
Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, still commands strong enthusiasm from the Republican base, with about 80% of his supporters saying they are “very” or “somewhat enthusiastic.” But Sherrill outpaces him nearly 2-to-1 on health care, education and infrastructure.
She loses her edge on taxes and affordability, the two biggest issues New Jerseyans face, the poll states. On handling taxes, Sherrill leads 39% to Ciattarelli’s 34%, and on cost of living, 45% say they’d trust Sherrill more while 29% support Ciattarelli.
Voters also are split on who would handle crime and safety better — 39% support Sherrill compared to 37% backing Ciattarelli.
Ciattarelli’s team took to social media to blast the poll. Chris Russell, a political strategist for the candidate, called it “pure fantasy” and compared it to 2021 polls that they said incorrectly predicted the gubernatorial results. He also suggested the data contains inaccurate calculations and “methodological malpractice,” saying Kamala Harris and Murphy supporters were overrepresented.
An Eagleton spokesperson did not immediately respond to Russell’s comments.
Seventy-eight percent of voters said they will “definitely” cast ballots in the November election, and another 15% said “probably.”
Pollsters surveyed 621 adults, including 579 registered voters, in mid-June. The poll has a margin of error of 5.4 percentage points.

The accelerated phaseout of wind and solar energy tax credits could raise rates in Wyoming by an average 29%, according to one consumer group.
The post Big Beautiful Bill could inflate Wyoming electricity rates, some observers say appeared first on WyoFile .","Though bargaining continues, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could land on President Donald Trump’s desk later this week with major implications for Wyoming’s energy economy and, very likely, residents’ electric bills.
For better or worse? Depends on whether you believe renewable energy is a help or a hindrance to meet the exploding electrical demand. 
Wyoming’s top politicians suggest the bill, in its Senate form, is a panacea for affordable fossil-fuel and nuclear energy. It will “unleash affordable, available, reliable Wyoming energy,” Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso said this week. 
Critics, meantime, warn that renewable energy is left out of the bill’s unleashing. Instead, the sweeping budget and policy bill will deliver a punishing blow to wind and solar projects by stripping key federal tax credits and solidifying Trump administration efforts to suppress permitting and other support for the industries, likely jeopardizing hundreds of projects slated throughout the country, they say.

Estimates of what that means for U.S. ratepayers’ monthly electric bills over the next several years range from a 10% to 20% increase. 
One consumer advocacy group — Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose 400 members include Microsoft, Amazon and Google — warned that if the renewable energy sector loses the 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits, it would raise the cost of electricity in Wyoming by an average 29% — the steepest increase in the nation.
“There is no question that removing tech-neutral energy credits would cause economic harm and job losses and drive up electricity prices in more than half the country,” the association’s CEO, Rich Powell, said in a prepared statement last month.
Reached Tuesday by WyoFile, the association said it could not provide further details regarding its Big Beautiful Bill analysis for Wyoming. You can read highlights and find links to its full report here. For now, many local utility officials are reserving comments as they review the 900-plus-page bill.

The average Wyoming household pays about $105 per month for electricity compared to the U.S. average of about $135, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Renewables’ growing role in Wyoming
For all of Wyoming’s fossil fuel might, tilting federal policy toward coal, oil and natural gas and away from renewables doesn’t cleanly translate into more affordable electricity, according to industry watchers. The U.S. fleet of coal-fired power plants, for example, is old and increasingly expensive to operate, utilities say. 
Meantime, wind and solar — albeit with the help of federal tax incentives — continually improve their cost efficiency while helping meet an insatiable demand to power artificial intelligence and other computational industries. Wind and solar are the fastest-growing sources of new electrical power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Wind power in Wyoming has doubled since 2019, making up more than 21% of electrical generation in the state.
If that momentum goes away, it will be difficult for utilities to maintain rates and meet burgeoning new demand, said Jonathan Naughton, director of the University of Wyoming’s Wind Energy Research Center.
“If you take a look at what could be built and installed today, it’s wind, solar and [energy] storage,” Naughton told WyoFile. 
Adding more nuclear power generation takes a long time, Naughton added, and no utility is proposing to build a new coal plant. Thanks to AI and industrial competition for direct power additions, “if you try and buy a [natural] gas turbine right now, you’re looking at five to six years before you can get one.”
Naughton declined to speculate on the Big Beautiful Bill’s potential implications for Wyoming’s electric ratepayers. However, increasing competition for new power, he said, has developers scrambling to build whatever form of power generation that can be installed the fastest.
“It comes down to, ‘How can government and the administration affect these things?'” Naughton said. “The bottom line is, we need a lot of electricity generation developed over the next 10 years. And what is ready? I think wind and solar and [energy] storage are really ready to do that.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball announced that a special examination of the Kentucky Department of Education found “widespread improvements needed across the agency.” 
Ball’s office released the examination, which is more than 550 pages, late Monday evening. The General Assembly passed legislation in 2024 directing the auditor to review the state agency that oversees public K-12 schools in Kentucky. 
“Kentucky’s children deserve to receive the education they need to be competitive in the real world,” Ball, a Republican, said in a statement. “This examination provides a clear path forward for student success, parent accessibility, and teacher support in all of Kentucky’s schools. It can serve as a guiding document for Commissioner (Robbie) Fletcher as he continues his work to improve the state of public education across our Commonwealth.”
The auditor says the Education Department failed to use $250 million that could have gone into bolstering underfunded areas of education during fiscal years 2021-24 — a conclusion the department disputes in its response to the report.
The disagreement between the department and auditor appears to revolve around their conflicting interpretations of state budget language.
The auditor’s report specifically says pupil and vocational transportation were underfunded areas that could have benefitted had the department reallocated excess funding as the state budget allows. Instead, the department returned or “lapsed” the $250 million to the state’s General Fund or Budget Reserve Trust Fund.
The money in question was allocated through the state’s basic education funding SEEK (Support Education Excellence in Kentucky) formula.
Earlier this year, Fletcher wrote that KDE was predicting a $40 million SEEK funding shortfall in the 2024-25 academic year.
The SEEK formula determines the amount of state funding to local school districts. The formula has a base per-pupil funding allocation, along with additional funding for factors like transportation costs or the number of students in a district who qualify for additional resources like special education, free or reduced-price lunch and English language assistance.
Other findings included: 

“Kentucky still has significant work to do related to closing achievement gaps and
ensuring all students are prepared for future success.”
When reviewing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, auditors “did not observe any program or activity at KDE that indicated non-compliance with current federal guidance” as of May 2025. 
KDE and the state’s other education and labor agencies “have gaps in communication, in alignment around strategic resource planning, and in goal-setting for a unified state-level vision for student success in K12, postsecondary, and career.” 

The auditor’s office conducted the examination with PCG Consulting Group on KDE’s activities between July 2020 and June 2024. The full report includes a June 2025 response to the audit from Fletcher on KDE’s behalf, saying there is “what may be perceived as a conflict of interest” with PCG. Fletcher said the consulting firm held contracts with KDE and was an active bidder on two KDE solicitations during its involvement in the examination. PCG was not awarded either contract. 
Ball said in a follow-up letter dated July 1 that KDE did not inform her office or PCG about the possible conflict of interest but instead “decided to raise this issue for the first time now,” after seeing the report. Ball also asserted that PCG and her office “worked side-by-side to critically analyze KDE, without reservation.” 
PCG also included a reply to KDE’s claim saying it conducts a “conflict check” before responding to any request for proposals or other opportunities, and that it has other state-level clients in Kentucky.

In a statement about the audit as a whole, Fletcher said it “took many, many hours of staff time to speak with the auditors and provide the documents that were required for this deep look at how the agency operates.” 
“In every section, the report highlights the good work agency staff have been doing to support the students and educators of Kentucky,” Fletcher said. “The audit showed that morale at KDE is high, our staff members truly believe in the agency’s work and that superintendents believe they can rely on KDE to provide them with high-quality resources.
“KDE is an organization focused on continuous improvement. We look forward to utilizing the APA’s final report to identify opportunities for future growth and plans for continued improvement in service of Kentucky’s public school students. We welcome the opportunity to work with the Kentucky General Assembly for the legislative changes necessary to accomplish recommendations within the report.” 
Though they acknowledged they are still reviewing the audit’s findings, Republican House Speaker David Osborne and Rep. Scott Lewis, the chair of the House Primary and Secondary Education committee, said in a Tuesday press release that “it is abundantly clear that it provides an invaluable road map for improvements.” 
“The Department of Education holds arguably the most important mission in state government: preparing the next generation of Kentuckians for success. Yet, far too many students fall short of their academic potential because of failed programs, broken systems, and antiquated processes that no longer serve today’s needs,” the statement said. “Education continues to be a priority for the legislature. We’ve provided historic levels of funding — even after adjusting for inflation — and adopted policies to improve curriculum, behavioral issues, and attract talented educators.” 
The Republican lawmakers added that legislators “must consider recommendations and implement the changes necessary to create real, measurable improvement” and they look forward to working with KDE, educators and administrators “to address the concerns identified in this audit and to build a stronger, more accountable educational system for all Kentucky students.”
The Kentucky General Assembly will convene in Frankfort for the 2026 legislative session in January. One of the top legislative priorities will include deciding the next two-year state budget. 
The Republican Party of Kentucky issued a statement criticizing KDE for the “improperly returned” $250 million in SEEK funding, particularly amid the predicted shortfall earlier this year. 
“Until Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Department of Education can properly manage the funding already available for local school districts, they have no business requesting more money or using taxpayer-funded public relations stunts to pressure the General Assembly into launching new education programs — especially when Auditor Ball’s report clearly shows this administration is incapable of managing the ones already in place,” said RPK spokesperson Andy Westberry.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231107Gubernatorial_Night11_MM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 14:15:00.102493

(Jetta Productions Inc./Getty Images)Indiana scored a $6.25 million boost from the federal government to expand registered apprenticeships across the state – growing a path to high paying, in-demand careers for Hoosiers. 
The Indiana Department of Workforce Development Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship team secured the federal grant as part of a nearly $84 million national push by the U.S. Department of Labor to expand apprenticeship capacity. 
“These federal dollars ensure Indiana is in a prime position to deliver on President Trump’s Executive Order to modernize American workforce programs,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a press release. “We’re not just equipping employers with vital tools for skills development; we’re cementing Indiana’s leadership in workforce innovation and economic prosperity.”
The award includes: 

$1.28 million in base funding to bolster existing apprenticeship infrastructure.
$4,9 million in competitive expansion grants aimed at launching new apprenticeship models and reducing barriers for employers.

The RAP combines on-the-job learning, classroom instruction and mentorship to train individuals in their field. The program is offered in in several industries including agriculture, building and construction and health and life sciences. DWD Commissioner Josh Richardson said RAP is a pathway to good paying careers. 
“The resources allotted allows us to deepen partnerships with Indiana businesses, community colleges, and training providers – strengthening our talent pipeline and ensuring Hoosiers have the skills employers need today and into the future,” he said in a press release. 
For fiscal year 2025, there were a total of 25,250 active apprentices across the state – putting Indiana near the lead. 
Indiana’s demand for apprenticeship is rising after education officials approved a massive high school diploma redesign last year. The new graduation plan includes more personalized learning pathways and experiences, including taking college courses while in high school and gaining hands-on experience.

The Trump administration announced this week it was withholding $26 million in federal grant funding to Vermont’s public schools, part of a broader freeze of more than $6 billion nationwide for after-school and summer programs and English language instruction.
Funds for these programs were supposed to be distributed on July 1. But the U.S. Department of Education alerted the state Agency of Education they were holding the funds back “on the evening of June 30,” according to a press release by the Agency of Education.
The federal department told state education officials they will conduct a review of the programs, but did not provide a timeline for when that would be completed, according to the agency’s press release.
The abrupt pause in funding will likely disrupt local school districts’ operations. Those federal funds are built into local districts’ budgets for the 2025-26 school year, according to the release.
Vermont Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders said in the release the decision to withhold these funds, “disrupts districts’ ability to staff critical positions and provide a wide range of programming, including efforts to reduce chronic absenteeism and improve literacy outcomes.”
“This decision also contributes to a culture of uncertainty that takes away from the important work our schools need to focus on to support our students,” Saunders said.
Six federal grant programs were affected by the funding pause, according to the Agency of Education, including programs to provide instructional and support services to migrant children and their families.
The funds supported the University of Vermont-run Vermont Migrant Education Program that serves children who have relocated alone or with their families to obtain seasonal or temporary employment in agriculture, the Agency of Education release said.
Another program has supported instructional services and supports within school districts for English language learners. Those grant dollars were used to fund multilingual liaisons to help families integrate into their schools and communities through summer school and after-school English language services.
Other federally funded programs helped finance mentoring programs and professional development for teachers. The state agency said in its release the programs were “essential to improving academic outcomes as well as supporting the retention of effective educators.”
Another program supported programming for mental health services, which the state agency said was critical to reducing chronic absenteeism.
The Agency of Education said it was “actively working with districts to mitigate the impact of this decision by conducting outreach and providing one-on-one intensive support to the field.”
“The Agency is proud of the critical investments that Vermont public schools have made using these federal funds and will continue to support districts in navigating the uncertainty in the federal funding landscape,” the agency said in its release.

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with […]","Guns on display in February 2023 at Caso’s Gun-A-Rama in Jersey City, New Jersey. (Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.
“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Gun-industry companies and groups give $2 million to help build state-owned shooting range

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

But people are far more likely to win their cases — and not get deported — with one.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Renata Daou to discuss her article, “A lack of immigration lawyers in CT means big court backlogs,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Renata’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Renata. You say a shortage of judges and immigration court staff has been an issue during the Biden administration, but it hasn’t been discussed much since President Trump ramped up his mass deportation policy. So what prompted you to do this analysis, and what do the numbers show?
RD: So it wasn’t much of a matter who the president was when I started doing the analysis. It was last year that I went to a self-representation clinic that groups were hosting in Hartford, in a church. So I just went, kind of like, to see what it was about. And when I was there, I was talking to the people who were hosting the clinic and the lawyers that were there, and I was like, ‘Oh, why are you doing this? How many people are usually coming?’ And I was just chatting with them. And, one thing that they told me that caught my attention was that they were doing this because a lot of these people who are coming to the clinics wanted to be represented by lawyers, but they couldn’t find anyone available, or they didn’t have the money to afford a lawyer. But this clinic is free, so that was an option for them.
And one of the lawyers that I was talking to was quite frustrated, because she was like, there are too many people. Like, I cannot handle more cases than I already have. There are way more people than like, and all of us can. Even if we try to take as many people as we can, it’s just impossible. So I was wondering if that is a problem across Connecticut? Is this a Hartford problem? I remembered that last year, the problem seemed to be a bit worse. I remember that Connecticut was like, maybe, like 12, in the ranking of not being represented. So it was actually worse last year than it is this year. So I remember that I looked at that and I was like, wow, that wasn’t like something that I really expected for Connecticut. I didn’t know that there was, like the shortage. So I just started talking to a bunch of different lawyers about their experience. Looked at the data like and that’s how it came to be.
WSHU: It’s interesting that the backlog has actually gone down from 46,000 in 2024 to 42,364. Is that from 2023 to 2024, or is this the 2025 number?
RD: I believe those are like pending cases.
WSHU: Pending cases, yes, it’s going down. The number of pending cases is going down.
RD: Yeah. It kind of spiked in 2023 and 2024, and now it’s decreasing a little bit.
WSHU: Now, why is that happening? Do you have any ideas?
RD: So I talked to a few of the lawyers about why they thought this was happening. But the maximum that I can say is just like anecdotal evidence, there isn’t really a set answer as to why it was going down from 2024 to 2025 when I talked to them. I know that some of them are like, maybe, like student clinics. They’re representing these people, and they’re trying to take on more and more people. It’s just like people rushing; the process is just like trying to get it done faster. But no one really knows.
WSHU: You visited the immigration court in Hartford. What was your experience? What was the process like?
RD: I went to a merits hearing. For most people, it was either the first or second hearing. So basically, what happened was that the judge was asking, like, ‘Oh, have you filed for asylum?’ Most people had already filled out the application. So he would ask, like, ‘Do you have a lawyer?’ Most people didn’t. So he was just setting another court date. But of course, he couldn’t be sitting forever. So like, for most of them, they’re like, Okay, next time they come, we third our lawyer, we’re gonna go through with the process. So it wasn’t when they actually presented all the evidence. It was just like those initial hearings.
WSHU: How difficult is it for someone in immigration court to represent themselves without a lawyer? What difference does having a lawyer make in an immigration case?
RD: Your success rate if you have a lawyer is way higher than if you don’t have a lawyer. I believe it’s just like the knowledge of the law, because, like, a lot of people don’t know, like, what documents they need to fill, what programs they are eligible for, because there’s a lot of different visas that you can apply in the US. There are a lot of different programs that you can qualify for, depending on your situation. And if you have just arrived in a new country, some people speak English. Some people don’t. If you just like, arriving and you don’t really know where to start, what you’re eligible for, it’s kind of like, hard to create a case and to have all this documentation ready and prepared, if you’re doing all this by yourself, and you don’t even know what the process looks like, if you’re like, going completely like blank, I don’t know. You think, like, realistically, like, what are the chances that you’re actually going to be able to, like, defend yourself against, for example, like the government lawyer who knows the house, and those are the programs, and knows everything.
WSHU: You’re not on the same level as them.
RD: Yeah, and having a lawyer who knows all these processes and everything you’re eligible for makes a huge difference.
WSHU: What’s the situation? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? What’s your takeaway from doing this analysis?
RD: It’s kind of difficult to say if it’s getting better or not. I think the backlog might be coming down.
WSHU: Could that be because there are fewer people who are going through immigration court these days, because a lot of people are self-deporting?
RD: I don’t know how many people are self-deporting. I would say that I think it’s just, like, going down, just because, like I said, a lot of people cannot find lawyers. So, the cases get resolved quickly.
WSHU: You spoke to some lawyers. How do they feel about the future of immigration courts, for people who have to go through immigration court? I have Melissa here who says, “The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigration immigrant communities in our state and throughout the country are.” So they feel that if people got to know the immigrants, they would be less supportive of the harsh way that immigrants are being treated right now.
RD: Yeah, I was going to say that, like when it comes to the lawyers, all of them are very passionate about what they do, because this is a type of law that the like, financial return, for example, if you compare to corporate stuff litigation, you make way less money and the stress. So from what I saw, like the people who are in this type of work, they actually really passionate about getting their clients to get a better life and all of that, so that you can tell that these people are in this type of job, because especially those who are doing a lot of pro bono work.
Yes, I’m not sure how much they’re making, but the people cannot pay for the services. Like an immigration lawyer, if you’re paying out of pocket, it might cost $20,000; most people cannot afford that. So they’re very passionate about it, and they want their clients to succeed. But I also like the laws keep changing really fast, so it’s kind of, okay, how are we going to keep up with this? How many people can we truly represent and not leave them hanging? So there’s this balance.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/npr.brightspotcdn-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Uthmeier says they need to reverse that vote, or face the possibility that Gov. Ron DeSantis will remove commissioners from office. In a letter add[...]","Screenshot of Key West Police Chief Sean Brandenburg speaking to City Commission on June 30, 2025.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier says the Key West City Commission violated Florida law by voiding its police department’s 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier this week.
Uthmeier says they need to reverse that vote, or face the possibility that Gov. Ron DeSantis will remove commissioners from office.
In a letter addressed to the seven members of the Key West City Commission, Uthmeier says that by declaring the Key West Police Department’s existing 287(g) agreement void, “Key West has made itself a sanctuary city.”
Sanctuary cities have been banned in Florida since 2019.
“Prohibiting its police officers from receiving the necessary federal training to adequately enforce U.S. immigration laws not only prevents city police from enforcing current federal immigration law but also effectively prevents the city police department from participating in federal immigration operations,” Uthmeier writes.
“In this instance, however, it’s even worse. The Commission didn’t merely prevent the Police Department from entering a 287(g) agreement; it affirmatively voided an existing 287(g) agreement under which the Police Department was actively operating. Bad policy, and illegal.”
The Key West City Commission voted 6-1 on Monday night to void the agreement, put in place by the city’s chief of police, Sean Brandenburg, on March 4, with City Manager Brian Barroso’s knowledge but not the approval of city commissioners.
Several commissioners said on Monday night that they only learned of the agreement recently, calling the decision by the city manager to give approval “improper.”
Brandenburg told the City Commission on Monday night that he began receiving emails about the 287(g) agreements from the Florida Police Chiefs Association earlier this year. He said he also received phone calls from members of the Florida Sheriffs Association telling him that signing the agreement was mandatory “and that I should start moving forward.”
“Shortly thereafter, I was advised that the governor had laid out exactly how he could now remove a police chief from office if we did not enter into a 287(g) agreement,” he said. “This obviously made the situation more urgent for me. I found the most up-to-date version and brought it to [the] legal [department] for approval.”
The resolution approved by the Key West City Commission requests that Barrosso and Brandenburg “refrain” from entering into any new agreements until the courts have ruled on the obligations imposed on local governments. And it affirms that the Key West Police Department must assist federal immigration activities “when requested.”
As of July 1, ICE has signed 744 memorandums of agreement with local law enforcement agencies for 287(g) programs covering 40 states, including more than 280 with counties or cities in Florida, according to ICE’s website. That includes every sheriff’s office in the state.
This is not the first time that Uthmeier has threatened local elected officials. In March, Uthmeier warned three members of the Fort Myers city council that the governor could remove them from office if they didn’t allow the city police to question people about their immigration status and detain those subject to deportation.
“The City Commission must immediately reverse its June 30, 2025, action and allow the Police Department to resume cooperative engagement with ICE under its 287(g) agreement,” Uthmeier writes. “Failure to take corrective action will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”

“Any seam that had an issue where there was water leakage has already been fixed overnight,” DeSantis’ communications director, Bryan Griffin, told reporters following a press conference Wednesday.
The governor’s spokesperson also said the Florida Division of Emergency Management is in charge of the site at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport with federal oversight from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman wrote in a statement that vendors had tightened any seams at the base of the structures that allowed water to come in during the storm. She described the water intrusion as minimal.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.










It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.


– Shelby Gonzales, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.

In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Performance indicators released Friday show Louisiana’s economy shrank by 1.7% over the first few months of 2025 and is moving in what one expert called a “sideways” direction marked by sluggish growth and contractions at both the state and national levels. However, it’s not yet in recession territory, analysts say. 
New first-quarter data that became available last week showed the U.S. economy slowed further than analysts had initially thought. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of the goods and services produced, shrunk for the first time since 2022 and Louisiana posted the worst GDP rate in the Southeast region.
With a shrinkage of -1.7% GDP for the first quarter, Louisiana dropped in the state rankings from 15th to 38th, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce report released Friday. The sectors performing the worst included minerals extraction (mining, quarrying and oil and gas drilling), construction and finance and insurance. 
Louisiana economist Loren Scott said there is broad consensus that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are a big cause of the economic contraction. 
Trump’s tariff threats prompted American businesses to stock up on products, causing a surge of foreign imports into the U.S. that far exceeded the production of American-made goods and services, Scott said. 
Still, Scott is expecting GDP growth to improve for the second quarter at both the national and state levels. Those figures are set to be released at the end of July.  
  Real gross domestic product decreased in 39 states in the first quarter of 2025, with the percent change ranging from 1.7% at an annual rate in South Carolina to –6.1 percent in Iowa and Nebraska, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)
“The second quarter is gonna be totally reversed,” he said, though he hedged his forecast with a caveat. “If the tariffs stay in place, you’re going to see the economy slow down and inflation creep back up.”
David Dismukes, an economist with Acadian Consulting Group in Baton Rouge, was less optimistic, pointing to signs of inflation already increasing and a tight labor market. He expects both indicators to remain problematic for the remainder of the year with Louisiana continuing to mirror the U.S. economy.  
“We’ve been moving pretty much sideways,” Dismukes said. “I don’t think the economy is very strong … though we haven’t quite entered recession territory.” 
A U.S. Department of Commerce report released Thursday indicated that inflation ticked up in May. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s inflation reading to track the prices of goods and services, has risen 3.7% from December, bringing the average annual inflation rate to 2.4% nationally and 2% for Louisiana and the southern region. 
The main inflation culprit continued to be food and grocery prices. The cost of food, overall, in Louisiana has increased 2.8% since May of last year. That includes a 3.6% hike on food from restaurants and a 2.2% hike on groceries over the same period, according to the Consumer Price Index.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy to more accurately measure long-term trends, posted a 0.2% spike in May, increasing the state’s annual core inflation by 2.5% since last year.
Rising prices for goods and services often leads to wage growth. Wages on average began outpacing inflation over a year ago and continue to do so, though they have held steady at 4.3% since February, according to a Fed wage growth tracker. 
There are other signs of uncertainty on the horizon. After several months of gains, the average personal income of Americans fell 0.4% in May. And more significantly, consumer spending fell to unexpected levels, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday.  
The downturn in consumer spending is what pulled down the GDP, signaling there was more uncertainty in the economy than most had thought, Scott said. 
“The business sector doesn’t like uncertainty,” Scott said. “Uncertainty is the bane of economic growth.”
Until now, spending had remained strong throughout the high inflation period that began three years ago. Following steady gains through last December, analysts had estimated slower growth of just 1.8% for the first quarter of 2025, but they missed that mark by more than a percentage point as the latest consumer spending data showed just 0.5% growth. That disparity is what caused the Federal Reserve to revise its first-quarter economic report.   
One bright spot has been the labor market. Louisiana’s jobs market finally recovered from the hemorrhaging that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic five years ago. After lagging behind the rest of the country, the state reached its pre-pandemic mark in February with nearly 2 million non-farm jobs, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That number has been inching upward, though it remains to be seen if the trend will continue or level off.
Scott said he believes Louisiana can continue to post job gains. He cited a string of recent announcements from large companies moving into the state such as Meta’s planned data center and Hyundai’s steel plant. 
Sharing a different take, Dismukes said he doesn’t see much more room for job gains unless Louisiana can grow its population. 
Complicating the labor market is a series of high-profile raids by U.S. immigration officials targeting sectors that generally employ migrant workers. One of those is the construction sector.
Dan Mills, CEO of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have “absolutely” affected his industry. 
“I continue to hear more stories about empty job sites and builders having trouble finding people,” Mills said. 
Even documented legal immigrants are not showing up for work because they’re afraid of getting swept up in the raids and accused of having fake documents, he said. 
“The fear that is created by these officials showing up in unmarked cars and masks, they don’t know if they’re being illegally detained or kidnapped,” Mills said. 
He said the ICE raids are exacerbating what was already a tight labor market with not enough workers in the residential home building sector. 
“We’ve seen labor prices increase 38% over the last four years, and we have 350,000 job vacancies in residential contracting nationwide,” Mills said. “Any exacerbation of that is only gonna push that number up.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)As the U.S. House of Representatives debates whether to give final passage to Congressional Republicans’ signature tax break and spending cuts package, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released an analysis Wednesday that indicates implementation of the proposed Medicaid and food assistance cuts could cost Michigan billions in lost revenue.
 “Republican cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will rip healthcare away from our most vulnerable friends and family and create a ripple effect that cuts jobs and drives up costs for middle class Americans,” Whitmer said in a press release. 
The analysis highlighted three reports, the first from the Washington Center for Economic Growth. Compiled by Professor Robert Manduca of the University of Michigan, the report indicates Medicaid amounts to an average of 11.2% of the economic base of regions nationwide. According to Manduca that means Medicaid contributes roughly as much to metropolitan Detroit as the auto industry. 
Additionally, the report says many recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would no longer be able to afford their groceries, resulting in grocery stores losing revenue and impacting their ability to pay their employees, as well as buy food from suppliers, ultimately impacting farmers and other food manufacturers.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Another report cited by Whitmer, this one from the Commonwealth Fund, estimates that if the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP proposed in the GOP budget bill are allowed to take effect, Michigan’s gross domestic product would drop by $3.57 billion by 2029. A third report from the Michigan Health and Hospital Association found that the hospital industry in the state could see up to 17,300 jobs in health care cut, with more than 16,000 others indirectly tied to the industry also slashed.
“The cuts to Medicaid included in this bill will result in the loss of healthcare access throughout all of Michigan,” Brian Peters, CEO of Michigan Health & Hospital Association, said in the news release. “Healthcare providers will be forced to reduce services, impacting all Michiganders and harming the health and wellness of our communities.” 
The legislation, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, would extend the 2017 tax cuts for wealthier Americans passed during his first term, which would be offset by vastly scaling back spending from the federal government.
Whitmer, in the press release, said that Republican cuts to Medicaid, combined with the loss of $2.95 billion in direct federal funding, Michigan faces a total loss of more than $4.5 billion in gross domestic product as well as 41,500 total jobs. The job losses alone, she said, means Michigan would lose out on $319 million in state and local tax revenue. 
“With fewer people able to afford groceries or pay their hospital bill, local communities will lose spending, business, and jobs. Raising costs for working families to pay for a tax cut for the rich is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I’ll keep working with anyone to lower costs, create jobs, and protect access to affordable, quality health care.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Twenty-two businesses and nonprofits across Delaware have been awarded grants through the Delaware Grocery Initiative, part of the state’s effort to fight food insecurity and expand access to nutritious food in underserved communities.
The initiative, also known as the First State Food System Grants, is run by the Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) and aims to support food access in areas classified as food deserts or at risk of becoming so.
Grants ranging from $5,000 to $12,500 were awarded, with a total of $25,000 distributed in this round of funding.

The money will help recipients improve supply chains, expand cold storage, and strengthen partnerships among community-based food providers.
“The Delaware Grocery Initiative is about bolstering economic development and uplifting some of our most vulnerable communities,” said State Senator Darius Brown, who sponsored the legislation that created the program. “Access to nutritious food is essential for living a long and healthy life. This program ensures that critical component of personal health is a reality for all Delawareans, regardless of their tax bracket or the neighborhood they live in.”
More than 50 applications were submitted for this round of funding. DSB officials said they prioritized projects that focused on infrastructure improvements such as food aggregation, transportation, and storage—key elements in strengthening Delaware’s local food system.
Among the 22 grant recipients are organizations like Native Roots Farm Foundation, Lutheran Community Services, The HOPP, Jefferson Street Center, and YWCA Delaware.
The list also includes small businesses like Woodenhawk Farms Inc., Forever Freeze Co., and Farmacy Market.
All projects supported by this grant must be completed by December 31, 2025.
Since the program began in 2022, it has awarded more than $1.9 million to fund 39 projects throughout the state.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-02-at-11.48.12-AM.png,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)In a 4-3 decision, Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s 1849 law banning abortion had been “impliedly repealed” by the Legislature when it passed laws over the past half century “regulating in detail the ‘who, what, where, when, and how’” of abortion. 
The Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, finds that the Legislature could not have passed laws regulating abortion access if the 1849 statute was believed to remain in effect. 
“This case is about giving effect to 50 years’ worth of laws passed by the Legislature about virtually every aspect of abortion including where, when, and how health-care providers may lawfully perform abortions,” Dallet wrote. “The Legislature, as the peoples’ representatives, remains free to change the laws with respect to abortion in the future. But the only way to give effect to what the Legislature has actually done over the last 50 years is to conclude that it impliedly repealed the 19th century near-total ban on abortion, and that [the statute] therefore does not prohibit abortion in the State of Wisconsin.” 
Dallet wrote that when the Legislature passed laws restricting abortion under narrower circumstances, guiding “where, when and how” health care providers could perform an abortion and outlining how public money could fund abortion providers, it was repealing the 1849 law. 
The ruling comes three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark Court ruling that found there was a constitutional right to abortion access and marks the conclusion of a legal dispute that helped Protasiewicz win election to the Court in 2023 and Susan Crawford win election this April. 
In response, the Court’s three conservative justices filed dissents, accusing the majority of “propaganda,” “smoke-and-mirrors legalese” and “pure policymaking.” 
“The majority’s smoke-and-mirrors legalese is nothing more than ‘painting a mule to resemble a zebra, and then going zebra hunting. But paint does not change the mule into a zebra,’” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Those in the majority know better, but they do so anyway because they like the result and promised to deliver it.” 
In his dissent, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that the majority failed to show when the law was presumably repealed by the Legislature, saying that the opinion doesn’t properly address the Legislature’s actions in 2011 and 2015 amending the 1849 law.  
“The majority does not say when over those 40 years the Legislature once and for all repealed [the statute],” he wrote. “Was it when the Legislature passed a postviability ban? A partial-birth abortion ban? A twenty-week ban? A waiting period? A physician licensing requirement? The majority fails to say.”
23AP2362 Mandate
Following the ruling’s release, the state’s Democratic elected officials and abortion access activists celebrated the decision as a “win” for reproductive health care in the state. 
“Thanks to our lawsuit, today’s decision affirms that access to reproductive healthcare will continue to be available, helping ensure Wisconsin women today are not forced to face firsthand what it’s like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today is a win for women and families, a win for healthcare professionals who want to provide medically accurate care to their patients, and a win for basic freedoms in Wisconsin, but our work is not over. I will continue to fight any effort that takes away Wisconsinites’ reproductive freedom or makes reproductive healthcare, whether birth control, abortion, IVF, or fertility treatments, any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. That is a promise.”
Wisconsin’s state and federal Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by saying it wasn’t enough, promising to continue working to codify abortion access in law. 
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she will continue to work to enact her proposal to ensure women across the country have access to abortion care. 
“Today’s ruling tells women across Wisconsin that we will not go back,” Baldwin said. “Today’s ruling tells women that our government trusts you to make decisions about your own body and your future. Today’s ruling tells women in our state that they are not second-class citizens. But, this fight is not over. Every woman, in every zip code, in every state deserves the same rights and freedoms. I will not stop fighting until we make that a reality and pass my bill to restore the right to abortion nationwide and allow women to make their own health care decisions without interference from judges or politicians.”
State Sen. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said the Legislature must now pass a bill guaranteeing the right to an abortion. 
“Now that the courts have made it clear that Wisconsin does not have a total abortion ban, we must go further,” Subeck said. “It’s time to protect reproductive rights not just in practice, but in law. We must pass the Abortion Rights Restoration Act to guarantee the right to abortion and eliminate the medically unjustified, politically motivated restrictions that still exist in our state statutes. The people of Wisconsin deserve nothing less than full access to safe and legal reproductive health care without unnecessary barriers and free from judgement.”
In a concurring opinion, Karofsky wrote that interpreting the 1849 law as banning abortion gives the state the authority to “exert total control” over women and “strips women and pregnant people of the dignity and authority to make intimate and personal choices by exposing medical professionals who perform abortions to 15-year prison terms.” 
In her opinion, Karofsky details the history of abortion access in the U.S. and highlights four women who died because of restrictive abortion bans, including the recent deaths of two Black women in Georgia and a Honduran immigrant in Texas as well as the death of her own great-grandmother in Boston in 1929. 
“I tell the stories of Amber, Candi, Josseli, and my great-grandmother Julia to remind us that severe abortion restrictions operate like death warrants,” Karofsky wrote. “Under such restrictions women, children, and pregnant people are denied life-saving medical care while medical professionals are forced to sit idly at their bedsides, unable to do their jobs. Extreme abortion restrictions revive a time in our history driven by misogyny and racism, divorced from medical science; it is a world that must be left behind.” 
In her dissent, Justice Rebecca Bradley accused Karofsky of rewriting history to achieve a desired outcome in the case. 
“Not content with effacing the law, Chief Justice Jill Karofsky rewrites history, erases and insults women by referring to mothers as ‘pregnant people,’ slanders proponents of the pro-life perspective, and broadcasts dangerously false narratives about laws restricting abortion,” Bradley wrote. “Laden with emotion, steeped in myth, and light on the law, the concurrence reads as a parody of progressive politics rather than the opinion of a jurist.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8328-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one.
One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.
It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.
In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.
In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.
By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.
But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.
These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.
At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.
Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”
“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”
In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.



“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.
That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)
Scientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.
“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”
 Delays, confusion over PFAS
Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”
The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.
Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.
The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.
Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.
The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”
The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.
When Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.
Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.
When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.
In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”
The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.
“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.
Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.
A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)
Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”
PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.
Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.
“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”
“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”
  A letter dated April 29, 2025, notifying Michigan State University about the termination of a grant for research into PFAS, one day after the EPA said in a press release that it was committed to combating PFAS contamination by, in part, “strengthening the science.” (Obtained by ProPublica)
 Research under fire
The EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.
In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”
Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.
At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.
Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.
In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.
“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”
At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.
About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”
Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”
Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”
The EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.
The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.
“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”
The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.
“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3m-nocrop-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, President Calvin Coolidge also did.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

On the evening of April 5, my phone and our community’s emergency siren both started screaming at once, jarring my husband and me to our feet. I clicked my phone and heard an automated voice begin to speak, warning of a tornado near Oxford. 
My husband, emergency bag in hand, called for the dogs to follow as we hurried down the stairs to our “safe place,” a windowless storage room in the basement. Even there, we could see angry bursts of lightning and hear the siren as it continued to wail. 
My family — as do others across the state — knows how to respond to the severe storms and dangerous tornados that interrupt our lives, often with devastating results. 
In the past, the federal government, through FEMA, has also responded. But now the Federal Emergency Management Agency is threatened by an administration that wants to overhaul it. President Trump has said he wants to “fix a terribly broken system” by shifting emergency disaster response to the backs of the states. 
Together with Congress, we need to insist, as we’ve repeatedly done in the past, that the executive branch work alongside us when disaster strikes our communities. 
*
The Trump administration is not the first to downplay its role in providing emergency relief to Americans during disasters. President Calvin Coolidge took a similar stance during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. 
That year, months of persistent rain combined with runoff from melting snow pushed levees that had been engineered to constrain the Mississippi River beyond their limits. Beginning in mid-April, levees from Illinois to Louisiana began to crumble, and as they did, waves of turbulent water flooded fields and swept through towns.

While numbers hint at the destruction –hundreds of souls lost, hundreds of thousands of people displaced and thousands of square miles flooded — they don’t reflect the agony or suffering of those whose lives were capsized during the flood.
*
In late April of 1927, President Coolidge created a commission, headed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, to respond to the massive flooding that had by then spread across at least seven states. Unwilling to allocate any federal money to the effort, Coolidge instead called on the American public to donate $5 million. 
Hoover, an engineer by training, leveraged the public’s donations with the capacity of the American National Red Cross. Their volunteers provided food, clothing, medical care and temporary housing to those whose homes were destroyed. 
Meanwhile, the president stood steadfast, refusing to use federal tax dollars to provide relief. 
Or rebuild bridges or roads that had been swept away. 
Or invest in future flood-control efforts.
Newspapers up and down the Mississippi River Valley criticized President Coolidge’s insistence that the states absorb the cost of rebuilding their communities while also bracing for seasonal floods that would occur again. 
“It seems obvious,” wrote the Memphis Commercial Appeal, “that neither the head of the nation or any one of his responsible advisors realizes either the nature or the immensity of the problem.” 
The paper went on to question how a nation as wealthy as the United States could impose the “burden of tremendous loss, sacrifices, agonies and destruction,” on individual states. 
In Jackson, the Clarion-Ledger also questioned the government’s response, particularly since President Coolidge had repeatedly refused to witness the flooding in person. “Not a dime has the government appropriated. The truth of the matter is that it has been necessary to school President Coolidge day by day a bit more towards the realization of the immensity of the catastrophe.”
The public and Congress continued to demand that the federal government assume a new responsibility for its citizens, one that included disaster relief, recovery and prevention. 
Eventually, Coolidge struck a deal with Congress and in May 1928, Congress enacted the 1928 Flood Control Act. The law authorized the Corps of Engineers to design and construct projects that would control flooding on the Mississippi River and the Sacramento River in California. 
The new law also ended the philosophy that regional disasters were solely the responsibility of the states. Instead, it acknowledged that the wealth of the country would be used to alleviate the suffering of its citizens. 
In 1950, the Federal Disaster Relief Act created the pathway for states to ask the president for federal help during crises.  This was followed by the establishment of FEMA in 1979.
*
So far this year, more than 60 people have lost their lives due to tornados in the United States, including at least seven people in Mississippi. Though storms have uprooted trees, flooded streets and caused property damage in Oxford, our community has largely been spared the heartache these deadly tornadoes caused elsewhere. 
We don’t know what the future holds for FEMA. In April, President Trump appointed former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to a council charged with recommending changes that may overhaul the agency. 
But as tornado season rolls into hurricane season, we know that the destruction caused by these severe storms is more than any of us can bear alone. We must insist that the federal government keep its sleeves rolled up and support our communities during times of disaster.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Progressive groups are rallying around New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin after legislators moved last month to take the state police from his control.
Advocates from eight grassroots groups Wednesday denounced bipartisan legislation that would make the New Jersey State Police — now a division under the state department of law and public safety, which Platkin heads — its own department answerable directly to the governor.
They criticized the bill’s timing, coming as “federal law enforcement and judicial practices have become politically weaponized under an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration.”
“This misguided legislative effort could not come at a worse time, as we can no longer expect the U.S. Department of Justice to serve as a backstop to hold state police accountable for discriminatory conduct,” said Jim Sullivan, interim policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “New Jerseyans – and all people who enter our state – deserve better.”
Antoinette Miles, who heads the New Jersey Working Families Party, urged legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Murphy to reject the bill.
“At a time when our civil rights are under attack from Donald Trump and extreme Republicans in Washington, we need our elected officials in Trenton to be working with General Platkin more closely than ever to ensure that New Jerseyans’ rights are protected,” Miles said. “This dangerous bill, the apparent product of a political vendetta, threatens to erode the progress we have made.”
Other groups blasting the bill Wednesday included New Jersey Citizen Action, Make the Road NJ, New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, New Jersey Policy Perspective and the Latino Action Network.
Tensions have increasingly grown between the state police — the largest police force statewide with 3,000 members — and Platkin, whose office investigates fatal police encounters, oversees police licensing, and publicly reports on police major discipline and use of force.  The office issued two scathing reports last fall on racism in the agency’s hiring and promotions, which renewed civil rights leaders’ calls for a clean sweep of its top brass.
Such investigations are why Platkin should retain oversight, said the Rev. Charles Boyer, founder of Salvation and Social Justice.
“The New Jersey State Police has a long, well-documented history of racism embedded in their culture,” Boyer said. “To allow them to separate from the oversight of the Attorney General’s office is not just irresponsible — it’s an assault on the Black community. Their record with Black people is abominable, and if the legislature permits this, it will echo the same disregard for justice we see under the Trump administration.”
Spokespeople for the state police and Platkin’s office didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawmakers pushing the bill have cited the attorney general’s lack of law enforcement experience, interference with the ability of police do their jobs and tedious bureaucracy in the attorney general’s office, among other concerns.
The legislation does have some tentative initial support from the NAACP New Jersey State Conference.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Harmful “forever chemicals” flow from wastewater treatment plants into surface water across the U.S., according to a new report by a clean-water advocacy group.
Weekslong sampling by the Waterkeeper Alliance both upstream and downstream of 22 wastewater treatment facilities in 19 states saw total per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations increase in 95 percent of tested waterways after receiving discharge from the facilities. Some of the waterways supply drinking water to nearby communities.
The study also found increased PFAS levels downstream of 80 percent of waterway-adjacent fields treated with “biosolids,” solid matter recovered from the sewage treatment process and spread on farmland as fertilizer.
Research on PFAS has linked the chemicals to multiple types of cancer, liver and kidney damage, reduced fertility, lower birth weights and endocrine system interference. Now, scientists suspect the chemicals can also impair immune system function, said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, who was not involved in the new report.
The study is the second phase of Waterkeeper Alliance’s National PFAS Monitoring Initiative. Phase 1, conducted in 2022, revealed PFAS contamination in 83 percent of tested U.S. rivers, lakes and streams. That number rose to 98 percent of the sites included in the most recent study.
“PFAS pose one of the most urgent environmental and public health threats of our time,” Waterkeeper Alliance CEO Marc Yaggi said at a press briefing after the report’s release last week. PFAS from industrial sources flow through wastewater treatment plants and into waterways of ecological, cultural, recreational and public health significance, he said.
“These wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove PFAS, and they face significant challenges managing this pollution, while accountability from industrial source polluters remains limited or nonexistent,” said Yaggi.

PFAS are a class of more than 9,000 man-made compounds designed to resist water, grease, heat and oil. Found in a wide range of consumer products, from clothing and nonstick cookware to cosmetics and fire retardant foam, PFAS are also released as industrial waste by the facilities that manufacture these goods.
Once in the environment, they do not break down, instead accumulating in water, soil and air. That’s how they got their unnerving “forever chemicals” name.
“It really doesn’t matter how you’re exposed to PFAS, whether you eat it, drink it, inhale it or even if some of it gets in through your skin,” Birnbaum said. “They’ll build up in us.”
While advanced treatment technology to remove PFAS from wastewater exists, most facilities do not have it. None of the 22 facilities included in the study employed PFAS removal technology, the Waterkeeper Alliance said.
The report’s findings underscore the need for stricter limits on PFAS discharges from industry sources, said Kelly Hunter Foster, the alliance’s senior attorney. Absent federal standards, restrictions on PFAS discharge are left to state or municipal authorities, she said.
The lack of Environmental Protection Agency guidance places an unfair burden on cities that lack both the technology to remove PFAS from treated water and the expertise to determine the acceptable level of any given chemical, said Hunter Foster.
The result is a regulatory free-for-all. All but one of the treatment facilities analyzed in the study process water from industrial users that have no restrictions on the concentration of PFAS in their wastewater.
In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration set its first nationwide, enforceable limits on six PFAS compounds in drinking water.
Countless more PFAS chemicals may be harmful to humans and wildlife alike. “I don’t know that any of these chemicals are completely non-toxic,” said Birnbaum, the former federal toxicologist. PFAS left out of EPA regulation are less understood, not necessarily less dangerous, she added: “If you don’t look, you don’t know.”
And the new EPA rules are now slated to be pared back. The Trump administration said in May that it plans to delay enforcement of two of the Biden-era PFAS limits while rescinding the other four.
The Waterkeeper Alliance study identified as many as 14 different PFAS types in a single sampling site, and a total of 19 across the locations. Several of the compounds most commonly found at elevated levels downstream of treatment facilities in the study are not among those with EPA drinking water limits.
Currently, the EPA does not have any PFAS effluent limits or pretreatment standards, regulations that would restrain the ability of industry sources to discharge PFAS in the wastewater they send to treatment facilities.
“The lack of federal standards makes it impossible to keep the PFAS out of the system,” said Hunter Foster.
The new report includes policy recommendations calling for nationwide regulation of PFAS that treats the chemicals as a class, rather than individual substances, and the eventual phasing out of PFAS production and use.
A complete reduction in PFAS production is critical, Birnbaum argued. “Turn off the tap,” she said. “We’ve got to stop making these things.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2667-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

The contest — coordinated by the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Nebraska Manufacturing Alliance — has become an increasingly popular way to draw attention to the state’s manufacturing industry and products made in Nebraska-based facilities. Voter participation in the contest has grown each year.
“Manufacturing is so much more than meets the eye. It’s technology, agriculture, energy, and a driving force behind the Nebraska economy,” said Nebraska Chamber President Todd Bingham.  “We’re thrilled to showcase the cool things made right here in Nebraska every day that benefit the lives of Nebraskans and beyond.”
Voting is open to the public, with all Nebraskans invited to advance their favorite product to the next round. The winner will be announced at the NE Chamber’s 2025 Manufacturing Summit, this year to take place Oct. 6 in La Vista. 
The summit coincides with National Manufacturing Month in October.
“Manufacturing drives innovation and growth across countless industries throughout the state,” said Marc Hock, Pinnacle Bank president, which also is a partner in this year’s competition.
Last year, the “Coolest Thing” top honor went to Valley Irrigation’s center pivot irrigation machine. The year before that, the winner was Rocket Mobility’s all-terrain tracked wheelchair made in Columbus.
In 2022, the inaugural winner was Kawasaki’s subway car built in Lincoln to run on the rail tracks of New York City.

(Photo courtesy of Oregon Department of Transportation/Flickr)The Oregon Department of Transportation plans to lay off up to 700 employees as soon as the week of July 7, with layoffs taking effect by the end of the month, according to emails from agency leadership obtained by the Oregon Capital Chronicle.
The move comes after the Oregon Legislature adjourned for the year Friday without passing a transportation funding bill that the department needs to maintain staff and close a more than $300 million shortfall.
ODOT Director Kristopher Strickler said in a 12:22 a.m. email to staff Saturday — sent just hours after House Republicans voted not to move on a funding bill for the agency — that the Legislature’s inability to pass a transportation package to keep the agency solvent is “shocking, scary and frustrating.” 
Strickler said the email was “the hardest message I’ve ever had to send in my career.” Employees who do jobs that are funded by the state highway fund will be most vulnerable to layoffs, he wrote, but the agency is trying to save as many positions as possible by leaving current vacancies unfilled. Still, they said, between 600 and 700 employees would likely be laid off.
The consequences of the Legislature’s inaction go beyond staffing cuts, according to transportation advocates and local transit agencies, which are preparing for broader challenges to maintain their own aging infrastructure.
House Bill 2025, in its original form, would have raised the state gas and payroll taxes, increased vehicle licensing and registration fees and created new taxes on car sales to generate nearly $14.6 billion for the Oregon Department of Transportation and local governments over the next 10 years. By the last day of the session, lawmakers failed to pass a watered-down version that would’ve raised $2 billion over the next decade only for the state transportation department, by raising the state gas tax 3 cents and increasing licensing and registration fees.
Strickler said the only way out of the agency’s budget problem is for the Legislature to dedicate additional funding or provide more flexibility in how current funds are spent. He said the costs for inaction from the Legislature will be long-term.
“It’s sure to cost the state more in the long run as our assets deteriorate. And that doesn’t even account for the immense cost of losing the valuable, irreplaceable knowledge that resides in the ODOT people who have dedicated years – sometimes decades – of their lives to making our agency and transportation system safe and reliable,” he wrote to staff.
 Local officials, transportation advocates express disappointment

Some advocates and public officials are urging lawmakers to take action in a special session.
The Oregon Transit Association expressed concern that Oregonians would lose access to public transit, pointing to the financial strain and high operation costs transit agencies are already facing. The original transportation proposal would have increased the portion of state payroll taxes that go to public transit from 0.1% to 0.3% over several years. Without an increase, officials at TriMet, Portland’s public transit agency, said they have to cut 27% of their bus service, eliminating 45 of 79 bus lines.
“Vital infrastructure jobs are on the line, and our ability to deliver basic safety services like filling potholes and improving traffic conditions is at risk,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson told the Capital Chronicle. “I urge the legislature to act quickly and deliver a solution that supports all Oregon communities, including Portland.”
Like Wilson, Bend Mayor Melanie Kebler previously testified in favor of House Bill 2025, which she said would have especially helped fund safety maintenance needed throughout Highway 97 in Central Oregon.
However, Kebler opposed lawmakers’ last attempt at a transportation package, House Bill 3402, which proposed to raise taxes and fees to fund the Oregon Department of Transportation and would not have extended any additional funding to cities and counties.
“Any revenue increase for transportation needs to be shared fairly with cities so that we can keep up with increasing demands on our local systems in the face of rising costs,” Kebler told the Capital Chronicle.
The City of Bend has worked in past years to increase its transportation funding, but it cannot do it alone, Kebler said, adding that she’s hopeful lawmakers will return for a special session.
Without a transportation package, counties will be unable to afford safety upgrades such as reflective striping, rumble strips and guard rails, according to Erin Good, a spokesperson for the Association of Oregon Counties. Investments in bridge replacements and improvements to emergency response routes won’t happen, and counties will face staff reductions, resulting in less resources for pavement repairs, pothole fixes and routine infrastructure maintenance, she said.
Brett Morgan, a lobbyist and transportation policy director at the nonprofit environmental group Climate Solutions said the package could have saved lives.
“These investments could have made a real difference for Oregonians: they would have meant fewer crashes, more lives saved, and stable transit funding that would have enabled people to get to work, school, or the doctor’s office,” Morgan said. “Oregonians deserve a transportation system that is safe, clean, and fair. We will continue to fight to make that vision a reality.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Provisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.
The House version of the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.
But the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.
The Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.
The bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.
Advocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for some rural hospitals that are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.
“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”
Some groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.
“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.
The Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.
“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”
The bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.
“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.
In Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.
“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.
Removing all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.
Indiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, according to a 2023 report from the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according to State Department records.
In North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.
“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.
A Congressional Budget Office report June 29 estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.
A Republican response to an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its own response in turn.
“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.
Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.
States will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.
And the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.
“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented. It’s an attack on lawfully present immigrants.”

The costliest scam, however, has remained largely unquestioned: economic development incentives.
Providing tax breaks and subsidies to relocating corporations was agreed to be a dreary but unavoidable burden of being Southern, like sweating through a hot, humid August. But there has recently been a bit of a glasnost–an opening of debate–on this long-closed topic. Many North Carolinians are coming to understand that incentives are an irredeemable racket.
A determination to recruit northern businesses has been part of North Carolina’s political DNA for over 100 years. Long burdened by a history of rural poverty, state leaders believed that North Carolina must lift itself out of provincial deprivation by persuading Yankee enterprises to move south.
“Industrial recruitment” became so deeply lodged in the state’s political DNA that few people questioned even the most extravagant efforts to woo the cigar-smoking panjandrums on Wall Street and State Street. In the 1950s, Luther Hodges played Governor Goof Ball by posing on a magazine cover with his pants pulled down to reveal North Carolina-made underwear. North Carolinians did not consider this an embarrassment.
We’ve always been the eager seekers gazing at corporate prizes–jobs, factories, relief from grinding poverty. But we did not go so far as to directly subsidize industrial prospects until the 1990s. When Alabama won a big Mercedes plant that the German automaker had dangled before several southern states, North Carolina leaders decided that we needed to “get in the game” by providing corporate incentives. Since then, we have distributed countless millions of dollars to out-of-state corporations in return for the promise of jobs.
This policy was never based upon sound economics. Economists have long been nearly unanimous in the conclusion that incentives are not an effective economic development tool. Incentives create some jobs by bringing in new companies but destroy other jobs by causing local firms, which are placed at a disadvantage by the subsidies going to out-of-state rivals, to cut jobs on their own shop floors.
Recruitment “deals” also necessitate tax increases by increasing the demand for roads and schools, which further mitigates the benefit of the new company’s investment. States that offer incentives are like Lewis Carroll’s Red Queen, moving tirelessly but making no progress.
Still, North Carolina has offered incentives for decades. But the wasteful nature of this “game” has become so undeniable that abolishing incentives has become a topic of debate. It reflects well on our state’s political culture that the practice of providing incentives has become controversial. In South Carolina, corporate welfare is civic religion. We, by contrast, seem to be learning a lesson from a growing roster of deals gone bust.
One incentives-funded project after another has been cancelled by its corporate benefactor, with the state struggling to recover losses from subsidies already paid out.
Telecommuting has made it effectively impossible to recruit the best knowledge industry jobs, and the manufacturing plants we’re attempting to woo to our state sometimes aren’t getting built. And as the left-leaning writer Harold Meyerson has observed, non-union manufacturing jobs (which is what they are most likely to be in a state where the anti-labor “right-to-work” policy has been enshrined in the state constitution) are often not even good jobs at all. Median income in knowledge economy Raleigh is $14,000 higher than in Greenville, South Carolina, which with the help of incentives has brought in thousands of non-union jobs in auto manufacturing.
I used to think that at least some economic development incentives could pay off. Specifically, I was persuaded by the work of Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti that huge “Million-Dollar Plants” could create so many ancillary jobs that they could transform an entire regional economy. With thousands of new jobs reshaping an area, even a large fiscal subsidy could be justified.
But North Carolina has attempted to play that game, and the state has offered such lavish subsidies for these plants that it has simply become unreasonable. For example, the state offered one auto manufacturer a $1.5 billion package for a $1.6 billion plant. If the state had landed that deal, taxpayers would have subsidized almost the entire cost of the company’s facility.
This has gotten out of hand. At a time when public finances are already under stress, we are allocating scarce resources to corporations that have serially reneged on their promises to create jobs. We have spent decades playing a dirty game with other southern states that has served largely to enrich corporations that have little genuine commitment to North Carolina. It’s finally time to desist. Perhaps, going forward, public dollars should support the public good.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Money-chalkboard-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-02 12:25:21.707352

Jim Pillen, right, presents a signed version of Legislative Bill 383 to State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, a bill that included a provision from Hardin at Pillen's request to outlaw child sexual abuse material generated with artifical intelligence. May 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As the federal “one big beautiful bill” continues to move through Congress, one provision related to AI that Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and 16 other Republican governors opposed has been removed, at least for now.
The ever-changing federal legislation, a key priority of President Donald Trump, passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 215-214, and the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, 51-50. The House version would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade, raising concern it could entangle state laws against AI-generated child sexual abuse material or the nonconsensual use of someone’s likeness in intimate images. The Senate voted 99-1 to remove the provision related to AI.
However, as the priority legislation of President Donald Trump returns to the House, the AI components could return. U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has already introduced an amendment to revert the bill to the House version and “delete their dud.”
Nebraska lawmakers passed two laws in May related to AI that Pillen signed into law. They currently are set to go into effect in early September:

Legislative Bill 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering at Pillen’s request, prohibits AI-generated child pornography. Passed 46-3 as part of LB 383.
LB 371, from State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, provides civil liability for sharing AI-generated or computer-generated intimate images without the depicted person’s consent. Passed 49-0.

Pillen has joined a push led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders against the AI moratorium and said he was proud to defend “smart, commonsense protections.”
“AI holds great promise for innovation across our economy, but it also poses a grave threat to our kids if it is abused,” Pillen said in a Saturday post on X, formerly Twitter. “State leaders know best how to strike this balance, and Congress should respect that.”

Hardin, who joined Pillen for a bill signing of the “commonsense” legislation May 30, said lawmakers could never have envisioned the world of AI decades ago when writing existing laws protecting children. Pillen said he knows “it turns all of our Nebraska stomachs because of the values of what we believe in,” that there are predators taking advantage of young people.
Said Hardin: “Thanks so much to [Attorney General Mike Hilgers] and his staff for helping us wade through these dangerous waters that, frankly, our federal government has been waiting for other leadership to happen.”
The Nebraska Examiner asked Hilgers and his office at that bill signing if the Nebraska laws would be impacted by the federal legislation. They were unsure at the time.
The governors argued that the technology is already “deeply entrenched in American industry and society” and will be used throughout society over the next decade, “for harm and good.”
“That Congress is burying a provision that will strip the right of any state to regulate this technology in any way – without a thoughtful public debate – is the antithesis of what our Founders envisioned,” the governors wrote.

The Republican officials said they support Trump’s bill and his “vision of American AI dominance,” but they said they couldn’t “support a provision that takes away states’ powers to protect our citizens.”
“Let states function as the laboratories of democracy they were intended to be and allow state leaders to protect our people,” the governors wrote.

U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who led the amendment to remove the AI moratorium altogether, had briefly struck a deal to at least protect the AI laws related to online safety and protecting children that Nebraska and other states had enacted. 
“I regret that we weren’t able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language,” she said in a floor speech.
Blackburn continued: “But what we know is this: This body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology.”
