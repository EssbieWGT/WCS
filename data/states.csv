(Photo | Isiah Holmes)Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, a Republican, announced Tuesday he’s running for a second time to unseat Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul. 
The 41-year-old Toney has been the DA in Fond du Lac County since 2012. He ran against Kaul in 2022, losing by 35,000 votes. Kaul, a Democrat, recently announced he would be running for a third term as attorney general, ending speculation that he would run for governor after Gov. Tony Evers announced his retirement. 
In a news release, Toney said he decided to run again after having open heart surgery two years ago. 
“By the grace of God — and years of running — my heart held on,” Toney said. “That clarity led me here: if I could still make a difference for Wisconsin, I would. After seven years of broken promises and political spin in the Attorney General’s office, it’s time for change.”
In the campaign announcement, Toney said he would prioritize supporting law enforcement officers, reducing violent crime in Milwaukee and being more aggressive in prosecuting drug crimes. 
“As your Top Cop, I will stand up for every Wisconsinite, enforce the law, and bring conservative, common-sense leadership back to the DOJ,” he said. “That’s what Wisconsinites expect and deserve.”
The Wisconsin attorney general is the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the state, responsible for overseeing state law enforcement agencies, enforcing state laws as varied as water quality rules and election laws and defending state agencies in court. This year, Kaul has been especially active in joining multi-state lawsuits against Trump administration policies.

Cecil Brockman, who has been charged with sex crimes involving a child. 
House Speaker Destin Hall said Tuesday he is creating a bipartisan special committee whose work could lead to an expulsion vote. Appointments are likely to be announced Wednesday. 
Hall wants the committee to examine how such situations have been handled in the past, including opportunities for due process.
“We’re at the beginning stages of that process,” Hall told reporters. He couldn’t predict how long the committee will work. 
Brockman, 41, was charged earlier this month with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of a 15-year-old victim, NC Newsline has reported.  
Top Democrats and Republicans called on Brockman to resign his House seat representing part of Guilford County, but he has not done so. NC Democratic chairwoman Anderson Clayton asked House leaders to begin the expulsion process this week.
Hall said the only thing he knows about the charges Brockman faces is what has been publicly reported.
“If those things are true, then he has no business serving in the state House,” Hall said. “He’s got a right to due process in the criminal court system. He’s got a right to some due process here as a member of the House.”
The select committee will have to search for examples on how to move forward because it’s rare for state legislators to kick out one of their own. 
Former House member Thomas Wright, a Wilmington Democrat, was expelled in 2008 after a special House committee found he had mishandled a loan, campaign contributions, and charitable contributions. Wright was the first state legislator expelled since 1880. 
Brockman represents a heavily Democratic district. If he resigns or is removed from office, Gov. Josh Stein would appoint a replacement chosen by local Democrats. 
Brockman, who in his sixth term, had angered some Democrats for siding with Republicans on key votes. He barely survived a primary challenge last year. 
Democratic House leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said it makes sense for Brockman to resign before the committee convenes. 
“I hope he will do what is best for him in this circumstance, and I think resignation makes the most sense at this point,” Reives said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rep.-Cecil-Brockman.jpg,,,2025-10-21 19:17:12.796904

Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a lead House budget writer, outlines the chamber's state budget proposal at a press conference on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A key lawmaker in the North Carolina House wants to give health officials the go-ahead to dip into reserve money to prevent major cuts to the state’s Medicaid program — but the timeline and process for that proposal remain unclear.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), who chairs the House’s budget and health committees, introduced a plan Tuesday evening that would allow the NC Department of Health and Human Services to use up to $190 million in the state’s Medicaid Contingency Reserve to cover shortfalls in the state’s low-income health insurance program.
The department began cutting rates for all providers earlier this month, ranging from 3% to 10%. Leaders in the House and Senate have been unable to reach an agreement to provide more funding.
Lambeth said the plan to tap into reserves would allow the state to freeze those rates until an agreement is reached. It would likely cover any shortfall through “to the end of June,” he said.
“This is a clean way to resolve the problem,” Lambeth said.
But even if the House chooses to approve the bill during their session Wednesday, it’s not clear when — or if — the Senate would do so. Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said the chamber would not hold any more voting sessions this week. The next session date isn’t until mid-November.
A spokesperson for Berger did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the proposal.
It’s also immediately unclear whether the state would have the authority to tap into reserve funds without approval from lawmakers. The money has technically already been allocated to the department, Lambeth said, but it has “not been allocated for this purpose.”
“That’s really where the rub is,” Lambeth said.
Republicans have been critical of Gov. Josh Stein’s administration’s decision to cut rates, arguing they are unnecessary. But Stein and the state health secretary, Dev Sangvai, have said they cannot avoid making budget cuts without further funding from legislators. DHHS has said the money state lawmakers have appropriated to the Medicaid program so far falls $319 million short of what’s needed.
“Just like any household budget, we must make decisions based on the resources we know are available, not those we hope to receive,” Sangvai said in a statement ahead of cuts last month. “And under North Carolina law, the state is required to maintain a balanced budget, meaning we cannot spend money knowing we will run out well before the end of the fiscal year.”
DHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill.
The House returns to session Wednesday morning to vote on a new Republican-led congressional map.

(Courtesy CBP)Local managers representing a metal fabricator, textile manufacturer and commercial printer testified to New Mexico lawmakers on Tuesday they are all facing unpredictability and steep cost increases due to President Donald Trump’s tariff measures—costs they are passing on to customers. 
State legislators on a subcommittee tasked with responding to changes to federal economic policies met Tuesday in Santa Teresa, which borders Mexico and is an emerging state manufacturing hub, to hear from representatives of Monti Inc., Acme Mills and Monarch Litho, Inc. 
All three companies operate factories in Santa Teresa, and all have been scrambling to adapt to Trump’s widespread import taxes on numerous countries. Trump has touted the tariffs as a way to spur more domestic manufacturing and re-shoring of important industries to America. 
But that doesn’t make sense for Monti and its factory that makes copper busbar in Santa Teresa, according to plant manager Nate Duhl. Copper busbar is “a critical component in electrical equipment and infrastructure,” he said, and the company built the New Mexico factory to meet the growing demand for those products in the Southwest region. 
NM coffee roaster warns U.S. senator of ‘slow drip’ of price increases because of Trump tariffs

“We want to make it clear that Monte Incorporated fully supports the initiative to reshore manufacturing to the United States. Strengthening domestic capability and supply is essential for long term success of the American industry,”  Duhl told lawmakers. “However, in the short term, these efforts must be balanced with the current limitations of the domestic copper supply chain.”
And the domestic copper supply chain doesn’t really exist, he said. About half of all material used to create copper busbar nationally is imported, he said, “not because of cost advantages, but because domestic supply simply cannot meet current demand.” 
And the company was “100% dependent” on imported material for its Santa Teresa plant, which processed about 500,000 lbs of copper busbar per month, when tariffs went into effect Aug. 1.
Since then, domestic suppliers have increased pricing 10% to 20% due to the “reduction in competition,” Duhl said. 
In August and September, the company passed more than $1 million in additional expenditures onto customers, he said. And it was forced to come up with $2 million at once to pay the increased costs: Money that it would have used to grow and invest locally.
As a result of the tariffs, he said, “We’ve encountered headwinds unlike any we’ve ever seen before.”
In addition to the costs, the unpredictability of tariffs, which Trump has imposed and withdrawn on various countries repeatedly, leads to increased costs to consumers, Alex Sierra, the recently retired manager of textile manufacturer Acme Mills, said.
Democratic state lawmakers slam Trump tariffs and GOP economics

“It’s the instability of the tariffs: If they’re going to be applied; when they’re going to be applied,” he said. “I might have [shipping] containers on the water that I thought were good, and by the time they hit port, they’re going to have 100% tariff on.”
Guillermo Lopez, managing director of Monarch Litho, Inc., the commercial printer, also cited unpredictability in tariffs, which he said has reduced the company’s market share to the lowest he’s ever seen. 
State lawmakers Rep. Patti Lundstrom (D-Gallup) and Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia) weighed in on the managers’ presentations. Townsend offered sympathy to the managers, while noting that he firmly believes in the tariffs.
“You got caught in a storm that you didn’t really know was coming and, quite frankly, you didn’t deserve,” he said. “You were just trying to make a living under the rules that you have.”
Lundstrom criticized the rollout of the tariffs, and  noted they’ve significantly added to  construction costs, which were already increasing. She said she would consider ways the state could step in to offset costs to manufacturers, and she asked her colleagues to do the same.
“Can the state provide some support when it comes to stabilization of construction costs? I don’t know what that looks like,” she said. 
Sierra and Duhl suggested lawmakers look into a state tax rebate or credit that could reimburse companies for some or all the tariff costs. That would ensure “that we can continue to invest locally  in our workforce and our infrastructure,” Duhl said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9526056346_c029fd709f_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-21 19:17:12.796904

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A more than 16% drop in Nebraska Lottery ticket sales over the last fiscal year meant various state cash funds missed out on just under $10 million in revenue.
State Auditor Mike Foley revealed as much in a report this week, which shared that lottery ticket sales fell by $36 million in 2025. Foley attributed the drop to the expansion of casino gambling after Nebraska voters legalized the activity in 2020.

“The longer-term impact of new forms of gaming on future lottery proceeds seems ominous,” Foley said in the report. “The protracted course of lottery ticket sales is what matters most, and only time will tell if it experiences a significant ongoing decline.”
The decline in sales meant that roughly $9.6 million did not go to support various state cash funds that benefit from lottery revenues, including the Nebraska State Fair Fund, the Compulsive Gamblers Assistance Fund and a collection of 10 education-related funds.
The Nebraska Environmental Trust took the biggest hit, however. In 2024, the fund received about $24.3 million in lottery funds. It received about $20.1 million in 2025, per Foley’s report.
Back in 2023, lottery officials said they were warned of a possible double-digit percentage decline in ticket sales due to the expansion of casino gambling.
The drop concerns State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, who sits on the Nebraska Legislature’s Appropriations Committee. Earlier this year, he opposed pressure to cut funding from the Environmental Trust to make space in the broader budget, arguing the fund is critical to conservation projects across the state. Ultimately, lawmakers approved three one-time funding transfers out of the fund to support other initiatives the Pillen administration and others sought, siphoning off $13 million from the fund.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prokop has also co-sponsored two-part legislation that remains pending in the Legislature to legalize online sports betting. He prioritized Legislative Resolution 20CA from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, which if passed would put the legalization of online sports betting on the ballot.
The second piece, Legislative Bill 421 from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, would establish the regulatory framework for the activity under state law.
Prokop said he “wasn’t surprised” that Foley blamed the decline in lottery sales on casino gambling, as Foley was vocally opposed to its legalization. He said he hasn’t seen any data to prove that casino gambling detracts from lottery sales. He argued other factors could contribute to the drop.
Prokop and Lynne McNally — director of government relations for WarHorse casino — argued the proliferation of skill games available at convenience stores might play a larger role in declining lottery sales. McNally noted that many skill games are located in close proximity to where lottery tickets are sold at the counter.
“They are a direct competitor to (the) lottery, and that’s what’s been impacting their revenue,” McNally said.
It’s worth noting that between January to August of this year, Nebraska’s five casinos have generated roughly $24.7 million in revenue for the state through gaming taxes. That revenue supports the state’s general fund, the Compulsive Gamblers Assistance Fund and the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, according to documents from Nebraska’s Racing and Gaming Commission.
Bostar previously estimated that legalizing online sports betting would generate an additional $32 million in revenue. Prokop argued Nebraska is actively missing out on this money, because Nebraskans who want to gamble online will still do so in other states where it’s legal.
“We’ve got the busiest corn field in the country … right across the river in Iowa because people are going over and making wagers,” Prokop said.
In Foley’s report, he cautions that the spread of online gambling could further hinder lottery funds.
“If I were a betting man, I’d lay odds that the increasing popularity of such online activities, some of which occur outside of the State of Nebraska’s authority, will result in ever more gambling dollars being siphoned away from the lottery and its intended beneficiary funds,” Foley said.
Prokop said he doesn’t think Foley’s report will make much of an impact on the fate of the online sports betting proposals in the Legislature. He said he believes lawmakers will pay more attention to the initiative’s revenue benefits and favor the opportunity to give voters a chance to weigh in on the issue.

(Photo courtesy of Owen McKenna/Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center)A federally funded wildlife research center in North Dakota has been targeted for layoffs, putting its survival in question. 
The Interior Department plans to cut 28 of the 40 positions at the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown, a court document indicates. 
John Bradley, executive director of the North Dakota Wildlife Federation, and Gary Krapu, a retired researcher who still has an office at the research center, said only 29 positions are currently filled.  
“Twenty-eight of those are on the chopping block,” Bradley said. 
The cuts would be part of more than 2,000 Interior Department layoffs nationwide, though a court ruling has stalled the plan. The department announced Monday it will pause the layoffs after a federal judge expanded a temporary restraining order.
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center first opened in 1965, focusing on migratory waterfowl. It has expanded into areas such as managing grasslands, wolf recovery and saving pollinators.
Wildlife group warns federal budget cuts could hit Jamestown research center

David Steele serves on the City Council in Jamestown, where he also taught science and has gotten to know the researchers whose work has had international reach. 
“The collaboration that has taken place over all these years, and then just throw it all out the window — that’s a huge loss, not only to our community, but to our country,” Steele said Tuesday. 
The center is based in Jamestown but conducts research across the northern Great Plains with outposts in St. Paul and Ely, Minnesota; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Hot Springs, South Dakota. 
Steele said he hopes the center can stay open, but the job cuts will be hard on Jamestown, with spouses and families likely leaving along with researchers. 
“That kind of economic impact for our community would be a jolt,” he said. “Apparently, science isn’t important anymore.”

 The Jamestown City Council passed a resolution of support for the research center this summer after a budget cut was recommended in May by the Trump administration.
An email response from Robert Gleason, director of the wildlife research center, said he is prohibited from working during the federal government shutdown, including returning phone calls and emails.
The center is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, which falls under the Department of the Interior. 
Krapu has been working voluntarily since his retirement in 2012. His hope is that a core group of scientists could keep the center going. 
“It would be a huge loss for anyone with an interest in birds or hunting or farm conservation,” Krapu said. 
Duck hunting season is open in North Dakota, with research from the center helping contribute to regulations and preserving habitat.  
“For the hunter that is chasing ducks right now, the research center has helped them, whether they know it or not,” Bradley said.

Deidre Henderson speaks to reporters during the last night of the legislative session at the Utah State Capitol, Friday, March 7, 2025. (Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said Tuesday that the state Republican party “is using tactics too often that are taking us down the wrong path.” 
Henderson made the comments while speaking on a panel about dignity in public discourse, and in response to a moderator asking for an example of someone “shining with brightness.” 
“I have to give props to our governor right now,” Henderson replied. “Our governor, who leads a state and a party within our state that really, I think, is using tactics too often that are taking us down the wrong path.”
Henderson, a Republican, did not elaborate or take questions afterward. Her remarks come against the backdrop of Utah’s Republican Party launching an effort to undo a voter-approved law at the center of the state’s current redistricting process ahead of the 2026 election. 
Henderson told Utah News Dispatch last week the moves add uncertainty into the process and she fears that as a result, “we won’t have maps when we need them, or that we’ll have to change in the middle of a process.”

Utah GOP chairman Rob Axson told Utah News Dispatch Tuesday that “the ‘tactics’ we are taking are merely what the law says is available to us as we fight to protect the structural and constitutional order of the Republic nationally and here in our state.”
Earlier this year, top legislative leaders criticized Cox for vetoing a measure that would have allowed him to appoint and the Senate confirm Utah’s chief Supreme Court justice every four years, one of several measures focused on the judiciary after lawmakers publicly criticized the court’s decisions on redistricting and abortion. Cox signed a new version of the bill last week that extends the term to eight years.  
On Tuesday, the lieutenant governor praised Gov. Spencer Cox as an example “of how to do it differently and how to do it better, and you don’t have to just fall in line with the national trend to be successful and to be impactful.”
‘Choose humanity,’ Utah Gov. Cox says in message to college students after Charlie Kirk killing

As chair of the National Governor’s Association, Cox asked Americans to “disagree better” starting in 2023. After the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in September, he urged rejecting violence and division. 
“This is our moment. Do we escalate, or do we find an off-ramp?” Cox said in a news conference after announcing the arrest of a suspect in Kirk’s killing. “It’s a choice.”  
It was a contrast to the tone taken by President Donald Trump, who said he hoped for healing but also blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s death. 
Disagreeing while respecting others’ inherent worth, even despite gaping political differences, was the subject of Tuesday’s panel discussion hosted by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
It’s natural to respond with an attack when treated with contempt, acknowledged panelist Tim Shriver, chairman of the Special Olympics and a creator of the Dignity Index, a tool measuring speech on a scale from contempt to dignity.
“Is that the best way to win?” Shriver asked. “I suggest that’s worthy of a discussion, not because we want to temper our passions or because we want to create a moral equivalence between positions, but because we’ve got to figure out what’s going to work. It’s a practical question.”
He recalled a woman asking him, “What do you want from me? I hate hateful people.”
“Most people hate hateful people,” Shriver said. “And we think that’s the best strategy — hating them — because they’re so hateful. And we don’t quite snap out of it enough to realize we’ve become what we loathe.” 
The audience at the panel discussion in Salt Lake City responded with laughter when Henderson shared aloud that her No. 1 rule is, “if it feels good, don’t say it.” 
“It’s served me well,” Henderson said. “I have never once regretted not saying something mean that would have felt good in the moment. I have, however, regretted violating that rule, because I have violated that rule on occasion.” 
Speaking about division that goes beyond disagreement and ends in political violence, Henderson said “it’s easy and tempting these days to give into despair. There’s a lot to be worried about, a lot to be concerned about, and it is tempting to feel like nothing we do matters because we’re just one person, but it’s such a dangerous attitude to have.”
“What we do will not solve all the problems,” she continued. “We do our little part anyway. There is a lot of darkness, but there’s also a lot of examples of light.”

(Courtesy of Cypress Creek Renewables)The fate of a proposed 1,300-acre solar farm in south-central Washington is back in the hands of Gov. Bob Ferguson.
The Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council voted Tuesday to recommend that the governor approve the Carriger Solar project in Klickitat County. Backers say the facility will generate enough power to serve thousands of homes.
This marked the council’s second time endorsing the proposed development. Ferguson turned down its initial recommendation to proceed in August, telling the state panel to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns that protections for cultural resources were not tough enough.
On Tuesday, the council approved a revised site certification agreement containing a new condition that the developers provide $100,000 in grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program once the project is operational. The vote was 6-1 with Maverick Ryan, representing the state Department of Natural Resources, dissenting.
That revised agreement, and a six-page summary of what’s transpired with the tribe since August, will be sent to Ferguson, who will have 60 days to approve or reject the project.
Kurt Beckett, the council chair, said during the meeting that he supported the project before and did not “really see a reason to change that at this stage.”
Matt Chiles, who represents Klickitat County on the panel, cast the lone dissenting vote when the council first approved the project in June. On Tuesday, he joined the majority.
Chiles praised the council staff for going “above and beyond” in responding to the governor’s directions.
“I’m comfortable with the mitigations that are proposed,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, is looking to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. 
“We greatly appreciate the state’s leadership on moving this important project forward,” CEO Sarah Slusser said following the decision. She called the council’s action “an important step toward meeting the state’s energy needs with clean, affordable, and reliable power.”
As proposed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system. It is expected to be online by 2027.
It would occupy 1,326 acres within a 2,108-acre development site that is mostly agricultural and rural residential lands. That footprint includes all solar arrays, battery storage facilities, operations and maintenance building, employee parking, and access roads.
Under the agreement approved Tuesday, fencing and solar panels must be pushed farther from the state route, Knight Road and parcels managed by the state Department of Natural Resources adjacent to the project. There also must be additional natural screening, such as earthen berms, rock piles, or native vegetation, on the north side of those state-owned parcels.
Tribal access to traditional and cultural properties must be maintained during construction.
Yakama Nation leaders, who Beckett said continue to oppose the project, have repeatedly asserted measures to protect cultural resources on and around the proposed location are not strong enough. 
For example, the tribe said the council should not allow installation of solar panels in the northern portion of the project area, rather than rely on setbacks and natural screening to minimize the visibility of the panels. 
In Tuesday’s meeting, the council was told the project would not be viable if it were scaled back to that extent.
Joanne Snarski, a siting specialist for the council, said tribal officials reiterated their concerns in a Sept. 25 letter. 
Separately, 12 public comments were submitted concerning the revised site certification agreement. “No comments provided new information or justified changes to the draft resolution,” she told the council.
When Ferguson first turned down the project, he made clear in his Aug. 22 letter that he viewed it as “consistent with state policies.” He also said it needed to proceed quickly so developers could secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits, he wrote.
“These tax credits are critical to ensure not only that the project remains financially viable, but that the energy it generates will remain affordable for Washingtonians,” he wrote.
Slusser said she did not have a timeline for when construction would begin, if the project is approved. “We are moving with urgency to break ground to ensure we can secure federal tax credits,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Vale-Air-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-21 18:57:20.828263

U.S. Rep.  Jason Crow said he was denied entry to the facility while attempting an oversight visit. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for the federal government on Monday responded to Jeanette Vizguerra’s assertion that she has been detained for an unconstitutionally lengthy time, arguing that her detention meets due process standards because it will eventually end at the completion of court proceedings.
If Vizguerra’s habeas corpus petition is denied “she will be removed back to Mexico. Even if her request is ultimately granted, the government would remain authorized to find a different country to accept her. Either way, her proceedings will end,” the filing says.
Vizguerra has been in detention at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora since mid-March after being arrested outside of her workplace. The Denver activist and immigrant-rights advocate alleges she was targeted based on her protected free speech and that her deportation order from 2013 is not valid.
She has a pending habeas corpus case in federal court in Denver, which she asks to set her free or grant her a bond hearing while litigation related to her immigration status plays out.

In September, her lawyers filed an amended petition saying her six-month detention is unconstitutional. They argued that many judges rely on six factors when considering a noncitizen’s detention without a bond hearing, known as the Singh factors, after a 2019 immigration case. Those factors include the length of detention, the likely duration of future detention, the conditions of detention, delays by the detainee and by the government, and the likelihood of a final order of removal.
Federal lawyers say applying those standards would be irrelevant because they should only be considered in cases when a person is detained during removal proceedings, versus when a person is detained with a final order of removal.
“If noncitizens detained (with a final order of removal) can simply invoke the Singh factors after six months of detention, it would render the Supreme Court’s decision in Zadvydas a dead letter,” the filing reads.
Zadvydas v. Davis created a standard that certain lengthy detentions of detained immigrants satisfies “due process so long as there is a ‘significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,’” government lawyers wrote.
“There is a significant likelihood of her removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. The absence of a specific date when the proceedings will end does not show, for this purpose, that the proceedings are indefinite,” the filing reads.
Vizguerra’s lawyers argue that the Zadvydas decision shows that after six months, the government takes on the burden of justifying continued detention.
The case continues as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportation efforts. According to an NBC News analysis, about 60,000 immigrants without permanent legal status were detained as of Sept. 25, with only about 30% of those with criminal convictions.

The committee, which includes four state legislators, Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth, Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore and Bank of Idaho President Jeff Newgard, approved the funding requests during its meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
The funding breaks down as follows:

$25,000 to promote, market and document events associated with the America250 in Idaho celebrations.
$20,882 for America250 “Spirit of the U.S.” boxes of supplies to be sent to school classrooms across Idaho.
$20,000 to continue the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council’s work. Specific line item expenses or funding requests were not identified. 
$8,000 to film and document an Idaho Centennial Trail spur trail horse ride that will culminate in Boise on July 3, 2026. 

“I think the committee is doing a great job,” Rep. Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow, said in an interview after Tuesday’s meeting. “ I am very excited about the movement that we have made and the progress that we have made. I went to (Washington), D.C., and there’s a lot of states out there that had no clue what they were even trying to do and I’m going, ‘We’ve got it under control out in Idaho.’” 
 America250 in Idaho celebrations are not subject to Idaho’s budget holdbacks

Altogether, the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council has a little more than $800,000 in state funding to work with, state officials said. 
The funding for America250 in Idaho is not subject to the 3% budget cuts that Gov. Brad Little ordered all state agencies – other than public schools – to make earlier this year in response to revenue shortfalls, state officials said.

The latest budget documents show the state budget is projected to end the 2026 fiscal year on June 30 with a projected budget deficit of $56.5 million, which would violate the Idaho Constitution’s balanced-budget requirement, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. However, before fiscal year 2026 ends in June, Little and the Idaho Legislature have the power to take steps, such as enacting new, additional budget cuts, to prevent a budget deficit from occurring if state revenues do not rebound on their own.
Mitchell, who serves as co-chair of the advisory council, said the funding for America250 in Idaho had already been appropriated during the 2024 legislative session and was not subject to this year’s holdbacks. 
Meanwhile, almost all state agencies including Idaho State Police, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and the Idaho Department of Lands, which is responsible for fighting wildfire on state land, are being asked to implement budget cuts of 3% before the end of the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30, which is days before the America250 in Idaho celebrations take place.
Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said in a written message Tuesday morning that the approximately $816,000 in state funding for America250 in Idaho was transferred to the office of Ellsworth, the state treasurer. Because she is an elected constitutional officer, Ellsworth was invited to participate in the 3% budget holdbacks, but Little cannot compel her to do so, Wolff said. A review of the treasurer’s fiscal year 2026 holdbacks did not include a reduction in funding for America250 in Idaho. 
 A look at how the America250 in Idaho Advisory Committee has spent its money so far

Financial records presented to the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council on Tuesday show the committee has spent $51,419 on things like logos, celebration videos, park reservation fees for its Sept. 11 kickoff event, billboards, T-shirts, trading cards depicting patriotic “Idaho Revolutionary Spud” potato dolls, cellophane bags and mailing packages and fees.

Additionally, the committee previously authorized spending $250,000 on awarding grants to Idaho cities and counties for their own local patriotic America250 celebrations next year and $10,000 on travel expenses associated with America250 in Idaho for Jane Perlaky, a Boise advertising director who is the project coordinator for America250 in Idaho. 
Members of the America250 in Idaho Advisory Committee also considered a request Tuesday to spend $6,000 for Idaho musicians to professionally record a patriotic song commemorating the America250 celebrations, but the proposal died after the motion to approve funding did not receive a second. However, advisory council members said they may reconsider the funding request to record the song in the future. 
Members of the advisory council expressed enthusiasm for all of the planning and promotion they are doing for the patriotic celebrations. 
But McGrane and other members of the committee pressed for additional details on several of the funding requests and said they would like to have a better understanding of the overall available budget and the specific funding requests before the day that the advisory committee meets.
“We’ve spent about $350,000, give or take, and rather than me saying ‘give or take,’ it’s probably good for us to have an actual number and where that fits in (with the total available budget),” McGrane said during Tuesday’s meeting. 
Funding for the America250 in Idaho celebration was originally awarded to the Idaho State Historical Society, which announced it had awarded grants to nonprofit organizations and arts groups across the state. However, in March, the legislative co-chairs of the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council cancelled 29 of the nonprofit and arts grants the Idaho State Historical Society had awarded and the Idaho Legislature transferred the funding away from the Idaho State Historical Society, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The America250 in Idaho Advisory Committee’s two legislative co-chairs, Mitchell and Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, said that instead of providing the arts and nonprofit grants, the Idaho Legislature wanted to be laser focused on throwing patriotic celebrations that are directly tied to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. 
After Tuesday’s meeting adjourned, Mitchell said the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council is likely to meet again in two months, just before Christmas and the start of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12.

(Photo by Getty Images).The Montana Land Board voted 4-1 to approve a conservation easement across a more than 50,000-acre swath of land spanning three counties in northwest Montana, permanently providing public access and protecting wildlife habitat.
Phase Two of the Montana Great Outdoors Conservation Easement Project will more than double the protected land in the Cabinet Mountains between Kalispell and Libby, following the acquisition of a similar easement the Land Board approved in the fall of 2024. 
“The decision before you today reaches far beyond one property boundary,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks director Christy Clark told the board at its meeting on Monday. “This conservation easement represents a chance to protect something at the very heart of who we are: the Montana way of life. It’s about keeping our forests, our open spaces and our working lands healthy. It’s productive, and it gives us access for generations to come. Montana, forests and range lands are where livelihoods and wildlife meet, where families make a living, and where deer, elk and countless other species find habitat they need to survive”
In August, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission — the board in charge of FWP’s policy actions — approved the easement, which will partially be paid from FWP’s Habitat Montana funds. 
Approval by the state land board, comprising the top five elected officials in the state, was the last hurdle in a long process. Phase One, a 32,000-acre easement, was approved in 2024. 
Both phases of the Montana Great Outdoors Conservation project drew vast support throughout the public process from timber companies, conservation groups, politicians and recreationists, many of whom drove to Helena on Monday to speak in favor of the easement. 
State Sen. Mike Cuffe, who represents the northwest corner of the state, told the land board that on his drive into town, he stopped behind a school bus and “felt a bit of pride” at the long, flashing signal arm that extended from the bus — he had sponsored the legislation that mandated them. 
“Few others will remember that, but I do. I helped create a good thing. This proposal, this conservation easement proposed today, is a good thing,” Cuffe said. 
The Republican from Eureka spoke about his family’s history in the area, including a great uncle who drove cattle from Frenchdown up through the easement property into the Tobacco Valley, his father, who was “one of the last to pull a cross cut saw” logging in the area, and his own experiences hunting, hiking and fishing in the region. 
Cuffe alluded to other portions of northwest Montana that are privately owned and where “no trespassing” signs are becoming increasingly common.
“We don’t want to turn it into a rich man’s hunting paradise. We don’t want to turn it into a subdivision area,” Cuffe said. “I encourage a yes vote today on each of your part. I’m proud to support this. I’m proud like I was behind that school bus.”
The state’s timberlands, once the lifeblood of a number of towns across the region, have become smaller and more fragmented over recent decades as companies have bought and sold swaths of forestland and parceled bits and pieces off for development.

Just a decade ago, nearly 900,000 acres of the state’s privately-held forest land in the northwest was owned by Plum Creek timber. That company was purchased in 2016 by timber giant Weyerhaeuser, which three years later, sold off more than 600,000 acres to Southern Pine Plantations, a real estate investment company. Southern Pines subsequently sold nearly 300,000 acres to Green Diamond, a sixth-generation timber company. 
Green Diamond currently owns the land, which includes the nearly 86,000 acres comprising both phases of the Great Outdoors Conservation Easement. 
Jason Callahan, Green Diamond’s policy and communications manager, told the Land Board that the project was nearly six years in the making. 
“We’re excited about this project. We think it speaks for itself, and I’m not going to tell you why it’s important for the community,” Callahan said. 
Under the easement, Green Diamond retains full ownership but is “selling one stick out of our property bundle, that’s the development rights.”
Green Diamond will continue to manage the land as working forestland, and will continue to pay taxes to the three counties its land covers. The easement requires non-motorized recreational access for the public, but does not prohibit motorized access — Green Diamond is free to work out if and where it allows riders if it wants to. The easement’s language also stretches in perpetuity, a condition required in order to qualify for federal money.
“(Perpetuity) creates generational access to the land, generational access to growing timber, to grazing leases, accessing a third-party mineral rights, and of course, public access that will go on for generations with no gates and no limitations,” Callahan said. 
 But the permanent easement clause did lead Attorney General Austin Knudsen to cast the one dissenting vote. Knudsen has long been a vocal opponent to perpetual easements but supports shorter duration options. 
“Forever is a long time. We don’t know what the future holds, and I think we’re really constraining ourselves,” Knudsen said. 
He also said that voting for the project, being mostly federally funded, was akin to voting to increase the national debt. 
The value of the second phase of the Montana Great Outdoors Conservation Easement is approximately $57.5 million. 
Funding for the project includes $1.5 million from FWP’s Habitat Montana, which is raised from hunting licenses and a portion of recreational cannabis sales; $200,000 from the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust; and $35.8 million from the U.S. Forest Service Forest Legacy Program, which provides funding to conserve working forests through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Green Diamond has committed to donating approximately 35% of the easement’s value, roughly $20 million, as an in kind contribution. 
The biggest pushback to the easement came from representatives of mining and resource groups. 
WRH Nevada properties, a company that owns 54% of the mineral rights across the project area, had previously expressed concerns in both phases of the project that a conservation easement will limit its ability to conduct mineral exploration and future extractions. 
“When we talk to mining companies, exploration companies, for possible partnerships or purchase, whenever the conservation easement comes up, their interest completely goes cold,” said Lloyd Parsons, a representative of WRH. “It has a real effect on our ability to do business in the state of Montana.”
He added that the appraisal of the easement property — more than $50 million — valued the mineral estate as worthless, even as the market for rare earth minerals has soared in recent years. The appraisal had also been done without consulting the company, he said, or offering to purchase the mineral interests. 
A district court judge in Lincoln County had previously clarified that the language of the easement did not interfere with WRH’s mineral rights, which a lawyer for Green Diamond affirmed to the Land Board.  
The Montana Mining Association also expressed concerns over the precedent set by the easement and that the state’s mining interests will face major obstacles in the future if the easement prevailed without more consideration. 
 Groups in favor of the easement included the Missoula Economic Partnership, the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, the Montana Logging Association and the Trust for Public Land, Stimson Lumber Company and Stoltze Land and Lumber Company. Several individuals with roots in the area also voiced their support. County commissions for Sanders, Lincoln, and Flathead counties also supported the project. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte was absent from the Land Board meeting while traveling to South Korea, but approved the project by proxy. 
“Protecting and increasing public access remains our top priority,” Gianforte said in a statement. “This project does just that while preserving wildlife habitat while ensuring the timber industry remains a critical part of Montana’s economy. This easement builds confidence for further investment in Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-909715830-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-21 18:57:20.828263

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday more than 700 state employees and 700 Iowa National Guard members are not receiving pay due to the federal government shutdown.
The governor answered questions on the shutdown at a news conference about the release of the Iowa DOGE task force report. News came Monday that Iowa Workforce Development furloughed 67 employees as a result of the shutdown, and some union leaders have called for the state to access emergency aid to pay for these impacted staff members’ salaries.
Some of these employees have been completely furloughed while others are working two days a week, Reynolds confirmed, and stated IWD Director Beth Townsend has said the department does not anticipate impacts to processing unemployment claims or issuing unemployment payments. But she said she did not have an answer on whether there would be back pay provided for the furloughed workers when an agreement is reached in Congress to reopen the government.
“We’ll have to see what they end up doing at the federal level,” Reynolds said. “But again, if they would pass a clean (continuing resolution), then they could sit down at the table and they could start to work on the different appropriations, and get the government funded.”
The 67 IWD workers are part of a group of roughly 700 employees across Iowa state government agencies whose pay is affected by the shutdown, Reynolds said.
Tuesday was day 21 of an impasse in Congress over federal spending, set to become the second-longest federal shutdown in the country’s history. While the House passed a continuing resolution to provide funding for the federal government through Nov. 21, Senate Democrats have blocked the stopgap measure from passing if the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at the end of the year, are not included.
Democrats and some health care advocates have said allowing these ACA tax credits to expire will cause health care premiums to skyrocket for tens of thousands of Iowans. But several Republicans have said they are only willing to have a discussion on the issue after a temporary funding measure passes.
As the shutdown continues, programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicare and Medicaid are also expected to see impacts. A letter sent by Iowa’s all-GOP House delegation Monday to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer estimated 276,000 Iowans who receive SNAP benefits and 680,000 Iowa Medicare beneficiaries who use telehealth services could face problems if the shutdown continues into November.
When asked if the state can sustain benefits, Reynolds answered, “if the Democrats would pass a clean CR, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.” She said during former President Joe Biden’s time in office, Republicans voted 13 times to keep the government open, and called for Democrats to do the same under President Donald Trump’s leadership.
“The games that they’re playing at the expense of Iowans and families of low-income Iowans that need those resources are sad,” Reynolds said. “It’s a sad scenario. They have nothing else. They need to come to the table, and they need to get this passed.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Child care providers from throughout Arkansas continued to urge state officials for help Tuesday in light of the ongoing federal government shutdown and changes to the state’s financial aid program for low-income families.
The Arkansas Early Childhood Commission voted with no dissent to create an emergency working group of researchers, lawmakers and child care providers with the goal of assisting and advising the state Office of Early Childhood on how to keep child care services afloat and sustainable by Nov. 1.
The vote came less than a week after a commission work session in which child care providers said layoffs and closures throughout the state are imminent. The Arkansas Department of Education currently does not have access to 80% of its federal Child Care and Development Fund money, said Chris Barnes, a State Leadership Development Coach in the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
The division has about $16.3 million in CCDF funding on hand, which will last about five weeks because the pace of spending is about $13 million per month, Barnes said.
The CCDF supports the School Readiness Assistance Program, a financial aid system for low-income families to access child care. In September, the education department announced a new reimbursement structure and a sliding-scale copayment structure, with the goal of reducing the four-digit child care waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable.
The agency delayed cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1 in response to pushback from providers, but moved forward with participant copayments on Oct. 1 as planned.










There shouldn’t have been a program that was created for low-income parents without a business model that was created with it.


– Jody Abernathy, director of DREAM child care center in Sherwood


Those increased copayments have already forced some Arkansas child care centers to close because parents could not afford to pay anymore, Northwest Arkansas child care center owner Shahid Sheikh said at last week’s work session. The planned reimbursement rate cuts are expected to cost providers statewide $727,000 per week, according to a survey of providers in 50 counties presented at the work session.
Sheikh and Barnes were among the people suggested for the emergency working group by Debbie Mays, another Northwest Arkansas child care provider and a longtime member of the Early Childhood Commission. Mays said one lawmaker from each party should also be part of the working group.
Education department staff will reach out to the relevant parties to put the group together quickly, said Stacy Smith, deputy commissioner for the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
 Providers’ frustrations

The amount of federal child care funding the state has carried over from one fiscal year to the next has decreased year after year, Smith told the commission and the child care providers in the audience.
Fiscal year 2024, which began in mid-2023, saw $181 million carried over from the previous fiscal year’s allocation of $690 million. More than $111 million was carried over into fiscal year 2025. The state is now in fiscal year 2026 and only carried over $43 million, Smith said.
The drop in available funds required the department to “hit the panic button” and put forth a “very aggressive plan” to sustain the School Readiness Assistance Program, she said.
Arkansas child advocates concerned about changes to school readiness program 

“I keep hearing people talking about the providers in this, which is important… but this program is set up as a program for working families to assist them in their child care,” Smith said. “It was never set up as a system for a business model.”
Several providers took issue with Smith’s statement during the meeting’s public comment period. They insisted that high-quality child care is not possible without solid financial support.
Jody Abernathy, who runs the DREAM child care centers in Sherwood, said providers should have been included in the education department’s conversations about how to make the School Readiness Assistance Program financially viable.
“There shouldn’t have been a program that was created for low-income parents without a business model that was created with it,” Abernathy said.
She and Dawn Colyer of Sheridan both said they have gone without pay in recent weeks while trying to keep their child care centers open. Colyer said she also stopped providing her employees with health insurance as of Oct. 1.
The survey of providers presented to the commission last week projected that 250 facilities would see a total of 400 layoffs by November. Sarah Wheeler of Malvern said Tuesday that she recently had to lay off the person who trained her center’s staff.
Wheeler pointed out that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has often said education and children’s wellbeing are her top priorities.
“This is the most important part of education,” Wheeler said.
The commission agreed that the emergency working group should send its proposed solutions to Sanders’ office.

Sanders’ signature legislation in 2023, her first year in office, was an omnibus education bill that changed many aspects of Arkansas’ public school system. The LEARNS Act increased the minimum annual salary for K-12 teachers from $36,000 to $50,000.
This has led to staff retention problems in the early childhood education field, said Karen Marshall, who runs the Tender Loving Care child care center in Searcy.
“It was great for public schools, but for our teachers that are licensed, degreed teachers, [it had] zero impact, so our teachers of course are going to want to move to public schools,” Marshall said.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)TOPEKA — Kansas is one of 16 states that have enacted restrictive voting laws this year, falling just short of records set in 2021, according to a roundup of such laws from a national think tank.
The 29 laws tighten voter access by removing people from voter rolls, modifying mail-in ballot policies, or requiring birth certificates or passports to vote, according to a report released Oct. 21 by the Brennan Center.
“State governments in 2025 are nearly on pace to match the number of restrictive voting laws enacted in 2021, when states enacted more restrictive legislation than at any other point so far in the 14 years the Brennan Center has tracked state voting legislation,” the report said. “That year, driven in large part by lies about the 2020 election being stolen, state legislatures passed an unprecedented number of laws that limited access to voting.”
In 2021, 17 states passed 32 restrictive laws, according to the center’s count.
This year, lawmakers in at least 47 states considered an estimated 469 bills containing restrictive provisions during their legislative sessions, according to data collected up to Oct. 6. Twenty bills are still moving through legislatures, the report said.
Kansas legislators overrode the governor’s veto in March to pass a law that requires advance ballots to be returned by 7 p.m. on Election Day. They did the same in April, passing a law that forbids the use of federal funds for conducting elections unless approved by the Legislature. The center classified that law as election interference legislation. 
Similar laws in Iowa, Louisiana, Texas and Utah “give partisan state-level actors control over election processes,” the center said in the analysis, which was produced with the Democracy Policy Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.
In April, legislators passed a law that requires the state’s division of motor vehicles and the Secretary of State to compare registration rolls for noncitizens and investigate or remove them from the rolls.
The laws listed in the center’s report were not the only election-related pieces of legislation passed in Kansas this year.
Kansans will vote in August 2026 on two constitutional amendments via ballot measures. One would add a requirement that voters must be citizens. The other would change the way Kansas Supreme Court justices are selected, shifting the method from a merit-based nomination system to a popular vote contest.
Arkansas and South Dakota voters are also expected to consider revising constitutional language to limit voting to only citizens in 2026, and Texas voters will do so in November.
“If they succeed, these initiatives will have no practical effect, as it is already a federal crime and a crime in all four of these states for noncitizens to vote,” the report said.
A slate of election procedures and voting provisions was nestled into House Bill 2016, which the governor signed in April. Among them were modified disclosures and requirements for advance ballot applications. Legislators reworked a 2021 law that restricted groups that sent advance ballot applications to voters. The law was challenged in federal court, focusing on prefilled, mailed ballot applications that voting organizations sent to hundreds of thousands of Kansans in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. A judge blocked the 2021 law in July, ruling that state lawmakers tried to suppress free speech.
Danielle Lang, the senior director for voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, said in a July 31 interview that the 2025 changes appear “to be a recognition from the Legislature that the law it passed was wildly overbroad.” Those changes are still subject to the judge’s recent permanent injunction for part of the law.
However, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Attorney General Kris Kobach and Johnson County District Attorney Stephen Howe, who were the defendants in the lawsuit, appealed the decision in August to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.
While officials have maintained that the 2021 law was meant to address election fraud and promote election integrity, Lang disagrees. The law has nothing to do with those things, she said.
“Folks who work in elections, like myself, are really interested in having efficient election administration,” she said. “Often these laws are kind of papered over with this explanation, but they’re not actually geared at that at all.”
“My sense of things is that Americans support access to mail voting, and their legislators need to know that,” she said.
The Brennan Center’s roundup found that laws expanding voting access have decreased in frequency. About 30 were passed this year as of Oct. 6, which is fewer than the 53 enacted in 2023 and 62 in 2021, the report said. Thirty-two expansive laws were passed in 2024.
“The pace of democratic progress in many states has slowed just as democratic backsliding has accelerated in others,” the report said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-10-21 18:57:20.828263

Last month, Melisa Crook, a high school English teacher from Creston, was informed that she was facing termination for a social-media comment regarding Kirk.
Crook then sued the district in federal court, citing a series of pro-Republican posts by Superintendent Deron Stender and school board president Don Gee, and alleging that her First Amendment rights were being violated.

U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger recently granted Crook’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction blocking the district’s plans to terminate her.
The judge also deferred Crook’s request for a preliminary injunction until after a court hearing that’s currently planned for Oct. 31, 2025.
The order prevents the district’s school board from conducting Crook’s employment hearing, scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025, and from “taking any other adverse employment actions” against Crook based on her Facebook comments.










Crook posted her Facebook comments on her personal time, at home, from her personal Facebook account ... She did not purport to speak as an employee of the Creston Community School District.


– U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger 


In her ruling, Ebinger found that Crook “is likely to succeed in showing Stender took adverse action against her in response to exercise of her First Amendment rights” and that she is “likely to succeed on the merits of her First Amendment claim as to Stender.”
Ebinger added that she concluded “Crook spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern when posting her Facebook comment.”
As part of her ruling, Ebinger observed that Crook had “responded to and discussed the murder of a public figure, Charlie Kirk, and her (subsequent) longer post clarified her intent” in posting the original comment.
“Crook posted her Facebook comments on her personal time, at home, from her personal Facebook account,” Ebinger stated in her ruling. “She did not purport to speak as an employee of the Creston Community School District.
The school district had argued that a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction would defeat its decision to discharge an employee and improperly extend “the employment of a potentially incompetent employee.”
Ebinger rejected that argument, stating that “the court finds the enforcement of First Amendment rights outweighs any potential employment harm to defendants. Further, the public has a compelling interest in protection of First Amendment and other constitutional rights.”
As part of her ruling, the judge denied Crook’s request to be removed from administrative leave.
Lawsuit cites posts by superintendent
In her lawsuit, Crook, who has taught English for the Creston district since 2022, alleges she has been “subjected to retaliation, and is now threatened with the termination of her continuing-teaching contract, because of a private, off-duty comment on Facebook.”
Crook’s Sept. 10, 2025, comment was made in response to a family member’s Facebook post about the shooting death of Kirk, a controversial, conservative political activist. Crook wrote of Kirk: “He is a terrible human being … terrible. I do not wish death on anyone, but him not being here is a blessing.”
The next morning, after seeing how others had perceived her original comment, Crook wrote on Facebook that she did “not wish anyone death” and apologized.
Later that morning, she issued a more extensive apology on her own Facebook page, stating: “I do NOT condone violence or the killing of people you disagree with politically or otherwise. That was never my intent … I did not think he should be killed. After further review, I should have thought more about how I chose to post my thoughts, how it would sound. I take responsibility for the poor wording of my post.”
The lawsuit alleges Stender, Creston’s superintendent, called Crook into a meeting on Sept. 15, and reported that the district had received more than 111 emails and 140 telephone calls, with the vast majority of them asking for Crook’s firing or asking that their children be removed from her classroom.
On Sept. 25, Stender delivered to Crook a formal notice of his recommendation to terminate her teaching contract. Crook then requested a hearing on the matter before the school board, which was scheduled for Oct. 21, 2025.
As part of her lawsuit, Crook included a 43-page document displaying social-media posts allegedly written by Stender over the past several years. The lawsuit also claims Stender and Gee, the school board president, have each “made at least one Facebook post or comment agreeing with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asserting that in Florida, individuals have the right to hit other people with their cars” — a reference to DeSantis saying people, if they feel threatened, could drive over protesters.
The exhibit suggests Stender has made and shared political posts on a Twitter account he also used for school purposes, including content supporting Trump and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst; content condemning the “liberal media;” comments about “riots in liberal cities;” a post about supporters of former President Biden being “snowflakes;” and one comment stating, “if you don’t like America, leave with Bruce Springsteen and the other elites.”
Two separate posts attributed to Stender also called on Iowans to “vote for Ernst” and to “vote Ernst on November 3.”
Crook’s lawsuit also references social-media posts by Gee, the school board president, that include an immigration-related comment condemning what Gee called “bull— left-wing judges.”
Crook’s lawsuit seeks actual and punitive damages for violations of her First Amendment rights.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A group of lawmakers voted Tuesday to back efforts to get ambulance services paid for helping low-income and elderly patients without taking them to a hospital.
The vote came during a meeting of the Legislature’s Emergency Medical Services Interim Committee at the Capitol in Pierre. 
Ambulance services in South Dakota need to take patients to a hospital to get reimbursement for their work through Medicare or Medicaid.
That’s unfortunate in a lot of situations, according to Maynard Konechne, statewide advocacy director for the South Dakota Emergency Medical Services Association. It’s not uncommon for an EMT to arrive at the home of a diabetic patient who hasn’t been eating right, give that patient some food or a glucose pouch, and then hear the patient say they’re well and don’t want to go anywhere.
EMTs don’t force patients into the ambulance, said Konechne, of Kimball, but “if we don’t haul them to the hospital, we don’t get paid.”
Medicare, Medicaid tried reimbursements
Konechne told committee members that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could choose to reimburse ambulance services for the on-site care, called “treatment in place.”
The centers did that for a while a few years ago, but the practice didn’t last. 
The Emergency Triage, Treatment and Transport (ET3) pilot program was meant to reimburse providers for that kind of care over a five-year period. It ended two years early, in 2023, “due to lower than expected participation and lower than projected interventions,” according to the centers.
Data released last year by the centers, however, showed an average cost savings to Medicare and Medicaid of $537 per patient for the ambulance services that participated. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians used that data as a selling point in  its current push for the federal government to set rates for non-transport care.
State could make change
Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, moved that the interim committee draft a letter of its own to send to the federal government urging coverage for treatment in place. That passed unanimously.  
South Dakota doesn’t need a policy change at the federal level to cover at least some of the costs of treatment without transport, though.
Lawmakers look for ways to deliver on support for ‘essential’ ambulance service

Emery, who’s the director of the Rosebud Ambulance Service, told the committee that North Dakota has reimbursed services for non-transport care since the mid-2010s, writing reimbursements for those costs into their state-level Medicaid pay schedules. As of 2025, ambulances are reimbursed $323 for a Medicare or Medicaid call without a transport.
Sen. Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, said he’d like to encourage the South Dakota Department of Social Services to change the rules in South Dakota to allow similar reimbursements.
“We can do that as a state,” Jensen said. “We don’t have to wait for the feds to do that.” 
Reimbursements for trips to a patient’s home wouldn’t be as high as hospital transports, “but it would at least cover the expenses,” Jensen said, and would likely help save the state money by avoiding hospital bills for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees. The two programs are jointly funded by the federal government and states.
Other funding woes
The committee voted unanimously to support the “concept” of reimbursement changes at the state level, and to include that support in a report it will present to the legislature’s Executive Board next month. Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, said it’s not clear at this point if legislation would be necessary to make the change.
The full Legislature ought to be made aware of the idea, Reed said, “because there could be enough savings to actually pay for treatment in place in our Medicaid system.”
New report recommends state efforts to sustain rural ambulance services

South Dakota Searchlight’s questions to the state Department of Social Services on reimbursement for non-transport ambulance services were not immediately answered Tuesday.
Such reimbursements would be welcome, said Scott Jongbloed, assistant chief for Watertown Fire Rescue, but they wouldn’t necessarily solve the larger financial woes of South Dakota’s emergency care providers.  
Treatment-in-place calls represent only 20% of the Watertown agency’s call outs, Jongbloed told the committee.
But a combination of high call volume and low Medicaid reimbursement rates for hospital transports have put the service on such unsteady financial footing that break-even payouts for home visits wouldn’t be enough to fix the problem.
“We’re in a position now that our EMS is going to be $2 million, greater than $2 million, in the hole,” Jongbloed said.
‘Essential service’ issue remains
Tuesday was the committee’s last meeting before turning in its findings. The group opted against endorsing a bill that would designate EMS as an essential service, which typically means the government has to guarantee access by providing or funding it. Currently, a large share of EMS work in South Dakota is performed by volunteers. 
Some committee members said there are too many questions about funding and too small an appetite for additional spending in Pierre to designate a new essential service.
“If you make it an essential service, that’s going to require a lot of money,” said Rep. Dave Kull, R-Brandon. “And you hate to hear the word ‘taxes,’ but that’s what pays for all of our essential services.”
Rep. Josephine Garcia, R-Watertown, said it’s a “disgrace” that EMS isn’t legally considered essential. 
“It’s a necessity of life. It’s like a grocery store, it’s like gasoline,” Garcia said. “So I think it has to be an essential service. We will find the money.”
Reed, co-chairman of the committee, said the next step will be to convince more lawmakers to take the issue that seriously.
“We’ve got to have the conversation at the Legislature, and for the whole Legislature to have that fortitude,” Reed said.
Ultimately, the committee voted unanimously to include language in its final report “to encourage continued dialog concerning EMS as an essential service.”

Douglas Wozniak (R-Shelby Twp.) testifying in front of the  House Committee on Families and Veterans. Oct. 21, 2025 | ScreenshotA House Concurrent Resolution put forth by State Rep. Douglas Wozniak (R-Shelby Twp.) would call for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to direct “administrating agencies” to track their efforts to reduce Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. 
“ACEs, including abuse, neglect and household instability, are among the most significant predictors of lifelong health and social outcomes,” Wozniak said in a hearing on the resolution in the House Committee on Families and Veterans. “Nearly 70% of Michigan adults report at least one ACE and one in five report four or more. These experiences are directly linked to higher rates of depression, chronic disease and substance use disorder.”
“Addressing ACEs isn’t just about compassion, it’s about effective governance and long term cost savings,” he continued. 
In the hearing, Wozniak also clarified that the resolution, HCR 1, is specifically targeted towards educational agencies in response to a question from Rep. Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn).
“What we’re trying to do with this resolution is establish trust but verify to make sure that the programs are working the way they’re supposed to. Each school should have some type of social community director that can talk about these,” Wozniak explained. 
“When we have a conversation with the child, we try and make sure that they’re going to go on the right path,” he added. “That’s why we want to verify exactly how this can be taken care of and not have finger pointing.”
Lisa Farnum, the managing director for the Michigan Association of Health Plans foundation, presented alongside Wozniak at the hearing. She spotlighted the Dearborn veterans treatment courts as a success story of trauma-informed support. 
“These results mirror what our ACEs training promotes statewide,” Farnum said. “When systems are trauma-informed and relationship-centered, individuals are more likely to recover, reengage and thrive. Programs like this demonstrate the real world impact of HCR 1’s vision, building a Michigan that leads with resilience, understanding and hope.”
Wozniak also noted that, since the resolution directs the governor to take executive action on the issue, following the 2026 gubernatorial election, he would “contact the current governor at that point and make sure that they’re aware of the resolution and keep going forward with it.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 200 people gathered in downtown Raleigh Tuesday morning to call for more Medicaid funding before heading to the legislature to make their pitch directly to lawmakers.
A coalition of health care providers and Medicaid recipients — including representation from 25 statewide organizations — met on Jones Street to hear the stories of North Carolinians affected by the Oct. 1 cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates and prepare to share their experiences with state legislators who have so far declined to fully fund the program.
Advocates were hoping to convince state lawmakers to fully fund Medicaid services as part of a Medicaid Day of Action. Funding for the program in the most recent spending bill fell $319 million short of what the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said was required for the coming year.
DHHS cited that shortfall as its reason for instituting cuts to Medicaid reimbursements ranging from 3% to 10% across all services on Oct. 1. Republicans argue that the cuts are not needed and that DHHS could have continued full reimbursements until additional funding was passed.
“Funding Medicaid is a moral issue. Funding Medicaid is a bipartisan issue. It reaches across the aisle,” said Tim Rogers, CEO of the Association for Home and Hospice Care of NC. “North Carolina is better than this.”
Speakers who shared their stories ranged from those with physical and developmental disabilities and their families to those who receive Medicaid support for mental health issues such as substance use disorders.
John D’Angelo, chair of the North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities said “none of us want to be here today,” but with the health of so many at stake, they have no choice.
Johnnie Thomas said at a Medicaid rally on Oct. 21, 2025 in Raleigh that people experiencing homelessness depend on services too, and could lose access to physicians and counselors. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“This is a challenging time for the disability community and Medicaid, but there are no better advocates than everyone in this room because you all understand the stakes through your lived experiences,” D’Angelo said.
Addiction Professionals of North Carolina Executive Vice President Morgan Coyner, herself five years in recovery, warned that the loss of access to support services through Medicaid will lead some to overdose.
“Today, with the unpredictable and poisoned drug supply, this is more dangerous than ever. And I know this personally: I lost my mother to a fentanyl overdose in 2019.” Coyner said. “There are lives on the line, and we need to do something about it.”
The Medicaid cuts also endanger the unhoused community, said Johnnie Thomas, who said he depended on therapists and doctors as he worked to restabilize after roughly three decades of homelessness.
“They went bipartisanly across the lines and they gave us Medicaid expansion that helped hundreds of thousands,” Thomas said. “They’re trying to take that away. I’m asking them, why would you do this?”
In an interview after the rally, Kathy O’Loughlin of Chapel Hill said she came to advocate for her daughter, a Medicaid recipient who has complex medical issues after a brain aneurysm at 14 months old.
“We do use services, and they help her access the community, classes, get Medicaid services,” O’Loughlin said. “Without those services, it’s harder to get in the community, it’s harder to give her medical attention that she needs.”

Ada Elizabeth Gil Jiménez, a member of the Consumer and Family Advisory Committee with several medically complex conditions, said lawmakers need to ask themselves how many lives they’re willing to risk.
“I’m not someone who will spin it just to make someone feel nice about themselves’” Gil Jiménez told NC Newsline. “Right now, we need action. Right now, we need money. Right now, people’s lives depend on it.”
After the rally, Chris Hendricks, a member of the NC Council on Developmental Disabilities, said he felt energized that so many came to support Medicaid and speak to lawmakers.
“As a person with an intellectual disability, at times, we can feel alone — we certainly didn’t feel alone today,” he said.
But so far, lawmakers have not stepped in to help.
Though Republican legislative leaders convened the General Assembly Tuesday to pass new congressional maps aimed at flipping another House seat to the GOP, the Senate declined to take action on Medicaid, despite repeated Democratic calls to do so.
“There are hundreds of people in this building right now — there are thousands of people across the state who are going to lose access to services. There are small providers across the state who are going to lose their businesses if we don’t do something by November 1,” Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said on the Senate floor. “I’m objecting that we’re adjourning today without taking care of that very important piece of business.”

After Tuesday’s session adjourned, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters the cuts made by NCDHHS were not necessary.
Medicaid is usually funded through the state budget, but House and Senate Republicans are at an impasse in negotiations, and the budget is more than three months late.
Efforts to provide additional Medicaid funding in a separate bill are also at a stalemate over what should be included in it. While Senate Republicans want money for a children’s hospital in Apex and rural health care funds included in the bill, their counterparts in the House oppose funding for the hospital.
“I hope it’s resolved with us reaching an agreement to handle the money that’s needed in Medicaid, and the other things that have been previously agreed to that need to be followed through on,” Berger said.
Late Tuesday, House budget chair Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) shepherded a bill through the House Rules committee to allow the Stein administration to use up to $190 million in Medicaid reserve funds to cover the cuts. However, Berger said earlier Tuesday the Senate would not hold another voting sessions this week.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA214651-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-21 18:17:37.106056

(Photo courtesy of Northlands Rescue Mission)North Dakota has enough money to keep paying Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in November if the federal government remains shut down, but the state is unable to load the funds onto people’s electronic payment cards, state officials said Tuesday.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services is warning the public that SNAP benefits will be paused Nov. 1 if the shutdown continues past Oct. 31. 
Interim Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor said the state is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, but so far has been unable to find a solution, even if the state provides the funding.


Resources

“The cards won’t actually work, even if we have the money as a state, which we do, to backfill,” Traynor said.
More than 57,000 North Dakotans received SNAP benefits in September, totaling nearly $9.9 million for the month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned last week that SNAP will run out of funds at the end of the month if the government shutdown continues.
People who receive SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, receive the dollars through an Electronic Benefits Transfer card, or EBT card, similar to a debit card. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service uses a third-party vendor to issue those funds, according to Traynor.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the infrastructure that exists to implement SNAP is controlled by the federal government, not the state. 
“We don’t have access to the infrastructure,” Armstrong said.
USDA did not respond to questions seeking comment on Tuesday.
“Our call is on Congress to get together and solve this quickly,” Traynor said.
In the meantime, Traynor said members of the department have begun reaching out to food pantries to warn them about a potential uptick in people seeking food if the government remains closed.
“We want to make darn sure that they are prepared to address this urgent need on Nov. 1,” Traynor said. 
SNAP benefits on pace to run out in two weeks if shutdown persists

The Great Plains Food Bank is beginning to hear concerns from families who are worried about what will happen if SNAP benefits run out, said spokesperson Darby Njos.
“We’re beginning to prepare for that surge of people who may just need extra assistance as we go into November,” she said.
The food bank also has seen some first-time visitors who are federal workers not getting paid due to the government shutdown, Njos said.
The Great Plains Food Bank is based in Fargo but partners with food banks across the state including the Northlands Rescue Mission in Grand Forks. 
The Northlands Rescue Mission began planning Tuesday for increased demand in November, said Elaina Wickman, interim director. The food pantry typically provides 100 food boxes per week, but staff are projecting that may go up to 160 to 200 per week, she said. Staff also are anticipating they may need more turkeys for annual Thanksgiving meals.
The mission plans to put a call out to the community for increased food donations, Wickman said.
“We’re taking it one day at a time,” Wickman said.
North Dakota communities may need to work together in November to make sure food banks across the state remain stocked, Traynor said.
“That would be my call to action: Let’s take care of people out there that are having a difficulty affording food,” Traynor said. “Let’s help our neighbors.”
State officials expect that SNAP benefits issued before Nov. 1 will still be available to recipients, Traynor said. The department is continuing to accept and process SNAP applications and renewals. The department is awaiting guidance about whether recipients would be reimbursed for SNAP benefits not issued due to a shutdown.

(Screenshot with permission of WYMT)FRANKFORT — The Kentucky Registry of Election Finance continues to investigate hundreds of thousands of dollars in excess campaign contributions that London Mayor Randall Weddle gave through “straw donors” to help Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear win reelection in 2023.
But the matter is not expected to be discussed at Wednesday’s meeting of the registry’s board of directors.
John Steffen, executive director of the registry, told the Kentucky Lantern Tuesday that the agency continues to investigate the Weddle contributions, “but we’re not ready to bring it back to the board yet.”
Rare inside view of money race revealed by investigation of straw donations to boost Beshear

At issue are hundreds of thousands of dollars listed as having been contributed to Beshear’s campaign committee and the Kentucky Democratic Party by Weddle’s family members, employees of his company WB Transport, and close business associates.
The large bundles of contributions from Weddle’s family, friends and associates were first revealed in an April 2023 story in the Lantern that concluded the Weddle group was the single largest group of donors to Beshear’s reelection.
Weddle has said that days after publication of that article he reported directly to Beshear that much of the money was actually donated on Weddle’s personal credit card. Beshear’s campaign and the Kentucky Democratic Party then refunded $202,000 in contributions that had been made on Weddle’s credit card.
Later in 2023 the registry began its investigation. In February the registry staff recommended the case be brought to a close with a finding that Weddle had committed numerous unintentional violations of the law and be fined up to $5,000 per violation. Weddle’s attorney, Guthrie True, of Frankfort, told the board at that meeting that the recommendation was a fair settlement of unknowing violations of civil law. True did not return a phone message left at his office on Tuesday by Kentucky Lantern.
But several board members in February said there were far too many unanswered questions about how the huge and unusual bundles of contributions came about and did not want to surrender its ability to refer the matter to a prosecutor for investigation of possible criminal violations. The board voted 6-0 to send the matter back for further investigation.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-13-at-9.55.24-AM-1-e1698440453320-1024x601.png,,,2025-10-21 18:17:37.106056

President Donald Trump has pledged to eliminate the Education Department.The agency “is exploring additional partnerships with federal agencies to support special education programs without any interruption or impact on students with disabilities, but no agreement has been signed,” Biedermann wrote. Biedermann said Education Secretary Linda McMahon “has been very clear that her goal is to put herself out of a job by shutting down the Department of Education and returning education to the states” and that McMahon is “fully committed to protecting the federal funding streams that support our nation’s students with disabilities.”Trump’s administration moved to lay off 465 department employees, including 121 at the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, earlier this month amid the ongoing government shutdown.A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration from carrying out the layoffs, but the ruling provides only short-term relief as legal proceedings unfold. The department’s many responsibilities include guaranteeing a free public education for students with disabilities through IDEA.Trump has already suggested rehousing special education services under the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on social media in March that the agency is “fully prepared” to take on that responsibility.Fully transferring responsibility for IDEA would require an act of Congress — a significant undertaking given that at least 60 votes are needed to break a Senate filibuster and Republicans hold just 53 seats.",,,,2025-10-21 18:17:37.106056

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Polk County supervisors voted Tuesday to invest $200,000 to keep water quality monitors functioning across the state — a move officials said they hope other counties will mirror.  
The funding will help a University of Iowa-headed monitoring system that was set to end in summer 2026 due to a lapse in funding. Polk County officials said the data provided by the system is “vital” to the state as it implements different practices to improve water quality.
The Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, provides real-time measurements of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, discharge rates and temperature at about 80 locations in streams across the state.

Funding for the program, which is run by researchers at the University of Iowa’s IIHR Hydroscience and Engineering department, was diverted in 2023 via state legislation. The Walton Family Foundation temporarily sustained the system, but that money is set to run out in summer 2026. 
Matt McCoy, a Polk County supervisor, said Tuesday the $200,000 from the county will kick in after existing funds run out in June 2026. McCoy said this gives other counties, namely Linn and Johnson, time to “decide if they can participate” in the funding. McCoy said he “will bet” the other counties will find it important to participate. 
“I think we have an obligation as county government to make sure that we’re ensuring that the water that our residents are drinking is protected,” McCoy said. “So I think that’s our role, and I think this is an appropriate allocation of resources.” 
According to the county, the monitoring system needs $600,000 annually to be fully operational.
Importance of the sensors
Polk County has its own water quality improvement plans that focus on efforts in both urban and rural areas, according to John Swanson, the county’s water resources supervisor. The program builds wetlands, helps install saturated buffers, cover crops and similar initiatives. The monitoring data, he said, helps his team see the impact their initiative has on water quality. 
“We want to build stuff … but to do that, we have to educate people,” Swanson said. “We need to keep looking at the data, keep using that data, to say we’re going to be most efficient with our projects.”

Richard Leopold, director of Polk County Conservation, said it’s also important, from a scientific standpoint, that the data remain continuous and not be interrupted by a lapse of funding. Consistent, unbroken data streams help researchers to identify trends and understand the impact new practices have on a system. 
“We can’t have interruptions or it all falls apart,” Leopold said. 
Public safety, according to McCoy, is at the “forefront” of the water monitoring. He noted that recent statistics listing Iowa as having some of the highest rates of cancers in the nation, leads people to ask “questions that require the types of data” collected by the UI monitoring system. 
Adam Shriver, the director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement applauded Polk County’s decision in a news release. Shriver said losing the monitoring network would have dealt a “major blow” when addressing the “public health crisis caused by Iowa’s worsening water quality.” 
“The leadership Polk County has shown is inspiring – a model for how local and county governments can respond to the water-quality challenges that face Iowa,” Shriver said. 
Counties step in, but hope the state will follow up
The funding from Polk County includes $90,000 that McCoy said was “unspent” funding at the end of the county’s Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment, or CISWRA report. This two-year, $1 million endeavor pooled researchers to produce an unbiased and comprehensive study of water quality in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers.
The study, released this summer, amid the first-ever lawn watering ban in Iowa due to excessive nitrate concentrations in source water rivers, found that nitrate problems are “predominately” found in Iowa, and at that least 80% of nitrate contamination is linked to agricultural operations.

Reporting from late August based on documents obtained from the county, indicated the funding left in the CISWRA budget had been “zeroed out” by Polk County staff. 
A county spokesperson said in an email to Iowa Capital Dispatch in September, however, that more than 90% of the budget had been spent to pay researchers and other intended costs. The spokesperson said any remaining funds would be “dedicated to ongoing and new water quality initiatives in Polk County.” 
When asked about the CISWRA budget Tuesday, McCoy said supervisors wanted to put the remaining funds to “good use” and decided there was “no better use than collecting this data and funding this sensor project in the state of Iowa.” 
Larry Weber, director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at UI, commended the Polk County decision. He said it seemed “logical” Polk County would be the first to “step up” to help fund the monitoring system given the CISWRA report and water curtailment during the summer. 
“We think that this is vitally important that we keep a decade-long program of water quality monitoring going,” Weber said. “Water quality is an important issue in our state and certainly has shown signs over that period of degrading, so I think it’s really important that we keep this network up and running.” 
Weber said he has reached out to officials in Linn and Johnson counties, and has several meetings scheduled, but otherwise does not know the status of other county decisions to support the monitors. 
The rest of the Polk County funding, about $110,000, will come from American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, funding the county received and had earmarked for water quality. 
McCoy said it would be a policy discussion for the board in the future to decide if the county will continue contributing to the fund. But, he said, asking the state Legislature to restore the funding in its budget is at the “top of (the county’s) lobbying list” for the upcoming legislative session. 
“I’d like to see federal and state funding for this, or at least some type of partnership going forward, because this is vital work,” McCoy said. “What the University of Iowa is putting out is world renowned.” 
Polk County isn’t the only group interested in restoring the censors. The Izaak Walton League of America’s Iowa division launched a crowd-source funding campaign in September with a goal of raising $500,000 for the sensors. The half a million dollars would be enough to run the network at its most “basic capacity” but the group, and Polk County officials, said a $600,000 budget would allow the system to operate all of its sensors and make some equipment upgrades. 
As of Tuesday, the Izaak Walton League fundraiser had gathered more than $15,000 for the cause. 
McCoy said the effort demonstrates that residents are “very interested in being involved” in water quality improvement efforts. 
“The idea is that all of us can do something to make an effort to try to improve our water system and the quality of our water and for that matter, recreation and health in our state,” McCoy said. “And so we encourage anybody that wants to be involved to either participate through water monitoring or through writing a check or volunteering, if that’s something they can do.”

The goal? To “kind of push the public transit system to its limits,” Kellen Appleton said of the daylong, seven-vehicle odyssey.

Courtesy of Kellen Appleton/Instagram
Kellen Appleton is a regular rider on the Advance Transit buses that run in and around her hometown of Lebanon, New Hampshire. But recently, Appleton got to thinking: How far could local buses, like the ones she relies on in the Upper Valley, really take her?
Earlier this month, she set out with her housemate, Ana Chambers, to put the question to the test — at least, within the confines of Vermont. The duo rode what they think was the longest-possible trip across the state, within a single day, using only public buses. 
The journey, which Appleton documented on Instagram, started just below Vermont’s southwestern corner in Williamstown, Mass. Eleven hours and seven different buses later, they made it to St. Johnsbury in the heart of Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom.
The goal? To “kind of push the public transit system to its limits,” said Appleton, who works for a regional planning commission based in Weathersfield, Vermont, in an interview.
There are certainly more convenient ways to get across the state, even using transit. Amtrak runs two trains through Vermont that ultimately connect to New York City, for example, while Greyhound buses traverse the state between Boston and Montreal.
But Appleton said she and Chambers wanted to make their trip as challenging as possible by relying only on public transit that, unlike Amtrak or Greyhound, could not be booked ahead of time. They also wanted to use routes that ran on fixed schedules, which ruled out using microtransit services that can be called on demand.
In all, they paid just a single, $2 fare the entire day — “a bargain, right?” she said. 
Appleton and Chambers’ trip started with a 7:15 a.m. ride on The Green Mountain Express’ Purple Line from Williamstown, Mass., north across the state line to Bennington. From there, they caught a Green Mountain Express Orange Line bus to Manchester, and then a ride on The Bus, run by the Marble Valley Regional Transit District, into Rutland. 
From Rutland, they took a Tri-Valley Transit bus to Middlebury, then another bus from that same operator to Burlington. From there, they rode a Green Mountain Transit Montpelier LINK Express bus to the capital. Finally, from Montpelier, they took Rural Community Transportation’s U.S. 2 Commuter to St. Johnsbury, stepping off for the last time at 6:30 p.m.
Appleton said she was pleasantly surprised by how it was possible to make so many different bus connections throughout the state. It was a testament to the local transit agencies, she said, that each bus ran close enough to its listed schedule that she and Chambers could actually stick with the route they’d carefully planned ahead of time.
She noted, though, that some of the agencies’ schedules aligned for a transfer only once a day — or left just minutes to spare — meaning a single substantial delay could have scuttled the plan. That’s hard to complain about for a trip, like theirs, that was fairly impractical by design, she said. But she added that the “fragile” nature of parts of the itinerary underscored how difficult it can be for many people to rely on public transit for their needs.
Having more regularly scheduled bus service, especially serving rural communities, could encourage more intercity trips without a car, Appleton said.
Vermont spends more money on public transit than other similarly rural states, according to a 2021 report, though state lawmakers continue to debate whether to increase that funding in an effort to help the state make progress toward its climate goals.
Frequent transit service is “something that’s going to help a lot of people take that leap from, ‘I need to have a car to be independent and be a functional person as a part of society,’ to, ‘I can rely on the systems that we’ve put in place here,’” she said.
At the same time, she noted every bus she and Chambers took had at least one other person on board. While many transit routes are scheduled around commuters traveling only in the morning or the evening, she said, the trip was a reminder that there are people, who likely don’t have cars, using those services at all times of day.
She documented some of the day’s more memorable characters in an Instagram post. That included a man in Bennington, clad in a rainbow bomber jacket and white stone earrings, who was accompanying his young daughter — herself in a fur coat — on the bus to school. Two friends realized onboard, excitedly, that they were taking the bus to the same destination: a methadone clinic that opened in Bennington earlier this year. Three other riders from the Bennington area, all in high school, spent the ride discussing “the fall of communism,” Appleton recalled.
In Rutland, three friends boarded the bus and, with reggae music playing from a phone, unpacked a very different topic — which version of the video game series “Grand Theft Auto” was the best. Another rider worked at a cafe in Middlebury and, upon being asked if the cafe still served ice cream in October, responded: “Hell yeah we are. Follow me.” 
A “harried commuter” with a tattoo of Bernie Sanders boarded in Montpelier, Appleton recalled, traveling with an electric bicycle and “alternating sips of coffee, ginger ale, and water the entire bus ride.” The bus to Burlington, meanwhile, had a student on board who revealed the purpose of his visit to a friend just before stepping off, Appleton wrote: “I’m here to see my BOYFRIEND.”
The trip, which would take about three hours by car, also gave Appleton and Chambers a new perspective on towns they might have driven through before — but had never been able to take the time to look around, Appleton said. She said the trip was inspired, in part, by a genre of YouTube videos that feature people taking similarly impractical trips on public transportation and sharing the sights along the way.
“Now, I have some touch point, or some anecdote, or have some connection, to (each) place — and that makes me feel like I’m a little bit more at home than I would be otherwise,” she said. 
“Was it practical? No. But like, was it a great time? 100%.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)Minnesotans by the tens of thousands, from International Falls to Albert Lea, peacefully rallied for No Kings day this past weekend to protest authoritarianism. I was in my hometown of Minneapolis, where we heard from U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, Attorney General Keith Ellison, and other local organizers with immigrant rights and civil liberties groups fighting for the very American idea that we are a fabric, a community, that welcomes all stripes of many colors.
While the president was posting AI videos of himself wearing a crown and attacking protesters, I was reflecting on the precarious moment we are in and the importance of protesting en masse.
We welcome everybody into this movement, even more moderate folks who may not be up for every chant or every type of First Amendment action. In Minneapolis, we had anarchists (yes, I saw at least one sign) and chardonnay-sipping liberals marching together. 
Indivisible, which has organized the rallies, says they’ve worked “in coordination with local grassroots partners, grounded in nonviolence and no civil disobedience, and led by trained volunteers and community leaders committed to safety and solidarity.” (In fact, we were blocking many major streets with limited Minneapolis Police Department support.) 
The organizers’ argument is that lowering barriers helps bring new people into the greater project. If your grandmother in a mobility scooter is going to her first protest (and skipped out on the protest movements of 60 years ago), that shows there is a larger majority of Americans who are ready to make their voices heard.
In the same vein, I was relieved and proud that Saturday’s protests remained entirely peaceful, despite the administration’s best efforts to paint No Kings demonstrators as anti-American terrorists. MPD did not report any arrests related to the protests, and the New York Police Department also reported no arrests due to protest activity, even with 100,000 demonstrators in Times Square.
In addition to the demonstration of popular discontent, No Kings is a call to action. This is where bringing new people into the fold helps grow people power for what is needed next. Already, the next mass action is scheduled for March 29, 2026. You can help wish me my 33rd birthday by joining me on March 29 at your local rally across Minnesota and the country. 
The other call to action is a little harder. We all have seen in the news that federal agencies have mobilized in liberal cities to terrorize residents. ProPublica has reported that this included detaining more than 170 of American citizens. We know that the Twin Cities has been target for immigration action before, and there will eventually be more unconstitutional actions soon. If you participated in Saturday’s rallies and marches, you may have heard a call to action to be ready to mobilize to protest federal overreach this winter. This is not an easy ask. It is not a petition signature or $10 donation on ActBlue. But showing up — especially in our silly costumes and dance music — can illustrate how we are not afraid to stand with our neighbors and fellow American citizens.
Finally, about joy and humor: On the world stage, we have seen how protest movements have adopted comedic antics to appeal to a wider audience and make the point that repressive regimes are often laughable. In Chilé, Giovanna Grandón, known as Tía Pikachu, wore an inflatable costume of the beloved Japanese manga character to protests. In May 2021, Grandón was elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention for the new Chilean constitution. 
From Portland to Chicago to Minneapolis, demonstrators are taking this approach, even in the face of pepper balls and tear gas right to the inflatable fan.
At Saturday’s rally in Minneapolis, I got a lot of love for my inflatable, purple, unicorn costume with a turquoise horn. It almost got exhausting. A middle-aged woman in her own pink and white inflatable unicorn costume joked with me, and we all had a good time. Showing that we can unite with unbridled joy in the face of fear and retribution is the best antidote to tyranny and oppression. It actually made me happy that Trump posted that AI video of himself dumping on protesters. He was desperate to change the subject, even if it meant humiliating himself with his undignified behavior.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) A central Iowa nursing home has been cited for an incident in which a resident’s family member had to summon the police to provide critical medical assistance for their relative.
According to state inspectors, at 4 p.m. on Aug. 18, 2025, the staff at Perry Lutheran Home failed to provide a female diabetic resident with her scheduled blood-sugar check and a set of two blood-sugar injections.
About 6:40 p.m., after the resident’s blood sugar had dropped to 27 — a potentially lethal level, with anything below 54 considered dangerous and necessitating immediate intervention — a visiting family member arrived at the home and found the resident slumped over in a chair, unresponsive. Inspectors allege the relative summoned the staff to the woman’s room and asked them to call 911.
According to the inspectors, a staff nurse allegedly refused, stating that wasn’t proper protocol. When the relative insisted, the nurse allegedly told the relative to call 911 herself and left the room to begin searching for the facility’s emergency kit, which is used to administer a drug in cases of low blood sugar. Other staffers eventually joined in the search, which lasted about 15 minutes, but the kit could not be located, according to state inspectors.
At 7 p.m., the relative called 911, and the police dispatcher helped by providing guidance on lowering the resident to the floor. The dispatcher then asked whether there was a defibrillator in the building, but a nursing assistant to whom the question was relayed allegedly indicated she didn’t know.
According to state inspectors, police officers then arrived and, at the relative’s insistence, the officers initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Once paramedics arrived on the scene and administered a drug to stimulate the production of glucose, the resident became responsive and was transferred to a hospital for additional treatment.
State inspection reports indicate the woman’s relative reported that while she, the police and paramedics had been working to revive the woman, the nurse on duty never returned to the room to assist.
The inspectors allege that a subsequent review of medical records at Perry Lutheran Home indicated that on three prior occasions in August 2025, the female resident’s blood sugar was recorded at levels between 55 and 68 — all considered to be potentially harmful levels.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was not able to reach the home’s administrator, Melissa Gannon, for comment.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing proposed a state fine of $6,750 as a result of the recent findings. The imposed fine was tripled to $20,250 due to the incident representing a repeat, serious violation.
It marks the third time in the past two years that the home has faced trebled fines due to repeat, serious violations, although the penalties were held in suspension in two of those three cases:
Sexual abuse — In December 2023, Perry Lutheran Home was cited for failing to report an incident of sexual nature between two residents who lacked the ability to consent. Inspectors said that despite the facility learning of the incident, and despite having watched video of the incident, the staff concluded they were not required to report the matter. A $6,250 fine was proposed and then held in suspension so that federal officials could consider imposing a fine.
Fall-related death — In January 2024, the home was cited for failing to provide adequate nursing supervision to prevent resident injuries. In that case, a female resident of the home fell nine times over an eight-week period. After the ninth fall, the home allegedly failed to provide neurological checks to rule out a brain injury. Eventually, the woman was taken to a hospital and diagnosed with brain damage that led to her death days later. A $9,250 fine was proposed, tripled to $27,750 due to the repeat nature of the offense, and then held in suspension.
Emergency treatment — In November 2024, the home was cited for failing to send a resident to the nearest emergency room when there was a change in their condition, resulting in the resident later being admitted to a hospital with hypoxemia, bronchopneumonia and dehydration. Because that violation was a repeat offense, a state-imposed $5,000 fine was tripled to $15,000.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIAL-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-10-21 17:18:06.440993

(Photo by Carol Yepes/Getty Images)The organizers behind an amendment to legalize marijuana in Florida contend that the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis is interfering with their efforts to make the 2026 ballot and they have asked a court to stop it.
Smart & Safe Florida, the political committee sponsoring the amendment and which is largely supported by Trulieve, a medical marijuana company, last week filed a lawsuit over an effort by state election officials to toss out as many as 200,000 signatures for the initiative. They call the actions by Secretary of State Cord Byrd, appointed by DeSantis, “unlawful” and unprecedented. 
Smart & Safe needs to collect more than 880,000 signatures to make the ballot. The new lawsuit points out that Maria Matthews, head of the Division Elections, told local supervisors to throw out signed and validated signatures because Smart & Safe Florida did not provide the people it reached out to by mail with a copy of the entire amendment.  
Matthew’s edict to toss the signatures came after Byrd in March advised Smart & Safe Florida that the petition it was mailing voters and asking them to return wasn’t valid because it didn’t contain the wording of the amendment. 
The group began including the full language following Byrd’s correspondence and also provided Byrd with the names of all those who returned forms to it by mail.
Nevertheless, the suit calls Matthews’ actions unlawful. 
“Smart & Safe filed this lawsuit to require the Secretary of State to follow Florida law and to prevent the state from denying the Florida voters who signed the petition to have their voices,” the group said through a spokesperson.
“We are asking the court to enforce Florida law, it’s really that simple. In this matter in an unprecedented directive the Secretary of State’s office ordered all local supervisors of elections to invalidate upwards of 200,000 lawfully gathered petitions that have already been reviewed and certified by the local supervisors. The state is wrongly attempting to change the rules after the fact and deny these registered voters their voice in the process.”
Under Florida law, those seeking to place an initiative on the ballot have until Feb. 1 to gather the signatures they need. The latest figures posted by the Department of State show that organizers have collected more than 662,000 already.
Smart & Safe Florida is the same group that tried unsuccessfully to get pot legalized in 2024 but the amendment fell short of the 60% threshold needed for approval.
The 200,000 tossed signatures may not be the only legal obstacle the new proposed amendment to legalize marijuana is facing.
Politico Florida reports that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has not sent the proposed amendment to the Florida Supreme Court for review, despite the organizers having collected enough signatures to trigger that action.
Meanwhile, the legal challenge over the second pot amendment coincides with a Leon County grand jury’s probe into a $10 million Medicaid payment made to the Hope Florida Foundation, an initiative spearheaded by First Lady Casey DeSantis designed to help transition people off  Medicaid and other social service programs. 
Hope Florida subsequently directed the money to two groups that donated millions to the campaign to defeat the 2024 amendment to legalize recreational  pot for adults.

LaMonica McIver outside a federal courthouse in Newark on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Attorneys for Rep. LaMonica McIver squared off with prosecutors in a federal courthouse Tuesday over charges that McIver assaulted federal agents in May.
U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper, who is overseeing the case, did not issue any ruling on whether the charges should be dismissed on constitutional grounds, but said a decision would be forthcoming. McIver, a Democrat who represents the 10th Congressional District, has argued her actions on the day in question are constitutionally protected legislative acts.
“Whether this is criminal conduct is for a jury. I’m not wading into those waters,” Semper said.

McIver has pleaded not guilty to three charges stemming from a scuffle that occurred outside migrant jail Delaney Hall in Newark on May 9 when Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested by federal Department of Homeland Security agents. Prosecutors allege McIver attacked officers and impeded Baraka’s arrest, while McIver’s attorneys claim federal agents are responsible for starting the melee that erupted when Baraka was being detained. Prosecutors dismissed Baraka’s trespassing charge days after his arrest.
Speaking to a crowd of supporters gathered outside the courthouse Tuesday, McIver called herself the victim of political retaliation.
“It’s because I was doing my job, and I will continue to do so,” she said. “I’m not going to stop holding this administration accountable.”

McIver has joined a slew of Trump critics who have landed in court over charges they say are the result of their criticism of the president, like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, a New York Democrat who joined some of McIver’s colleagues in a courthouse steps rally Tuesday, mentioned the case against James, who was indicted on charges related to mortgage fraud.
“Something about Black women just get them stirred up,” Clarke told the crowd. “Black women get them stirred up.”

Semper ordered attorneys for the federal government to remove nine social media posts from the Department of Homeland Security’s X account that refer to McIver or the events of that day. McIver’s attorneys have said the posts cast her in such a bad light that they prevent her from receiving a fair trial.
Semper also asked the government to release any video footage from May 9 that hasn’t been shared with McIver’s team “with no delay.” McIver attorney Lee Cortes said defense attorneys received two dozen videos that were edited, ranging in length from 20 seconds to 20 minutes, without explanation as to what was cut or why. 
Some body-camera video footage publicly released recently captures the moments leading up to and after Baraka’s arrest, plus the 68-second time period when prosecutors say McIver assaulted two agents.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark McCarren agreed to review text messages sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents that day and share any relevant messages mentioning McIver with the court, though he said it’s unlikely any would be found. McIver’s team — who say they saw officers texting in the body-camera footage — said they want access to those texts to support whether any officers felt intimidated by McIver. Semper said he’d review the texts first. 
Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrats who were with McIver the day of Baraka’s arrest, were in the courtroom Tuesday, along with Rep. Nellie Pou and Baraka, also Democrats.
McIver attorney Paul Fishman, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, argued to Semper that McIver is a victim of selective prosecution and cannot be charged for legislative acts, arguments McIver’s legal team has made in multiple legal filings.
He compared federal prosecutors’ treatment of McIver to President Donald Trump’s pardon of Jan. 6 defendants, noting that the U.S. Department of Justice dropped cases against 160 Jan. 6 rioters facing the same charge McIver faces
“She was charged with something she wouldn’t be charged with if she was a Republican,” Fishman said. 
Semper asked why prosecutors didn’t also charge Menendez and Watson Coleman. Fishman said the government doesn’t deserve credit for being careful in selecting one person to prosecute.
“The boss wants this case prosecuted,” he said, referring to Trump. 
Fishman argued that, as a member of the House Oversight Committee who was conducting an official inspection of Delaney Hall the day of Baraka’s arrest, McIver’s actions are protected by the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which provides members of Congress with immunity from criminal prosecutions for legislative acts. 
Semper noted that the scuffle happened just outside the jail’s gates, not on Delaney Hall’s property. McCarren argued that the tour McIver received of Delaney Hall was a legislative act, but that deeming assault of federal officers an official act is an “absurdity.”
Semper repeatedly referred to the “68-second” time frame that included the actions that resulted in McIver’s charges, and asked whether the scope of the case against her should be limited to that time period. Fishman said it should not be.
“You can’t show 68 seconds without talking about what happened before those 68 seconds,” Fishman said.

,DC,2025-10-21 21:11:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,One stopgap after another: Shutdown puts Congress on the verge of failed spending process,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-stopgap-after-another-shutdown-puts-congress-verge-failed-spending-process,,"WASHINGTON —  On day 21 of the federal government shutdown, the political tensions and policy differences that contributed to it appeared likely to destroy any chance for the GOP-controlled Congress to find the bipartisanship needed to pass the dozen bills needed to fund the government. While that is very inside baseball, failing to approve the 12 appropriations bills will block lawmakers’ funding requests for high-profile projects in their home states, known as earmarks, from becoming law—like highway construction, water systems, education projects, research facilities and more. A full-year stopgap spending bill would also cause significant headaches for departments throughout the government that have faced challenges adjusting to the series of stopgaps that funded the government for the last year, even without the turmoil of the layoffs and funding cancellations enacted by the Donald Trump administration.The full-year spending bills are also the best chance Congress has to exercise its constitutional authority over government spending and are supposed to spur debate about where taxes paid by Americans can most help the country. Skipping that process and avoiding tough conversations about where funding is most needed, and where it is not, absolves lawmakers of a core job responsibility — securing money to help their constituents have better lives. As of Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans appeared nowhere near any kind of deal to reopen the government, which has been shuttered since Oct. 1. Members of the House are not in session and last voted on Sept. 19. The Senate has voted unsuccessfully 11 times on the same House-passed stopgap spending bill, failing to gain the 60 votes needed for it to advance. 'Extremely harmful’ effect of another stopgap Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s opposed to using what’s called a continuing resolution for the rest of the fiscal year instead of working out an agreement on the full-year government funding bills. “The impacts of another year-long CR would be extremely harmful to federal programs, particularly the Department of Defense, and should be avoided at all costs,” Collins said. Congress used three continuing resolutions to keep government funded during the last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. Lawmakers have relied on stopgap spending bills to fund the government for the entire fiscal year a handful of times during the past several decades. But Congress has not used stopgap spending bills for two consecutive years since the late 1970s, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Senate Republicans lunch with TrumpSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said after a lunch at the White House with President Donald Trump and other GOP senators that talks about the full-year government funding bills can only begin after the shutdown ends. “We want a normal appropriations process. We want to give them an opportunity to sit down and litigate some of the issues they want to talk about,” Thune said. “But that can't happen until the government gets opened up again.”North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven, chairman of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee, said a full-year continuing resolution is ""absolutely"" possible if the process doesn’t start moving forward soon. But Hoeven declined to say if he’d vote for a stopgap spending bill that voids the appropriations process for the second year in a row. And said he’s “of course” concerned about the negative impacts of a full-year continuing resolution. “I don't want to get ahead of the process. What I want to do is get government open and get back to regular order,” Hoeven said. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee and a senior appropriator, said it will take real leadership in both chambers to get any movement on the full-year bills. He also said he’s vehemently opposed to a stopgap spending bill for the entire year. “I think if we vote for a full-year CR, we've fully abdicated our responsibility, constitutionally, to be the power of the purse,” Reed said. South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said he “could not support a full-year CR.”“We've gotten so much of the work done, and now it's just a matter of whether or not Democrats allow us to bring them to the floor,” Rounds said, referring to the full-year Defense spending bill that failed to advance last week. Rounds said he thinks Democrats are struggling to figure out a way to end the government shutdown, which would potentially allow work on the full-year bills to get going again. “I think they made a very serious strategic error when they decided to jump on and to shut down government in the first place,” Rounds said. “And now they don't have a graceful way out, and that's a problem.”Process, interruptedNormally, by now, Republicans and Democrats would have agreed how much to spend on defense and domestic programs and divvied up that roughly $1.8 trillion to the dozen full-year government spending bills. The lawmakers tasked with writing those appropriations bills would have started meeting to work out spending levels and policy differences between the original House bills and the original Senate bills. That is all on hold because of the shutdown and may never even happen, potentially leading Republicans to write a stopgap spending bill for the rest of the year. Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt, chairwoman of the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, said she wants Democrats to vote to reopen the government, so she can get back to working on her full-year appropriations bill. “I want to do my job, which is why I am so frustrated that we didn't get to move forward with appropriations bills on Thursday,” Britt said, also referring to the Defense bill. “I think it was incredibly short-sighted of my Democratic colleagues to vote that down, because this is our opportunity to actually do work for the American people. And I think we should get our job done, not pass the buck.” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, the top Democrat on the State-Foreign Operations appropriations subcommittee, said he still has “hope for the appropriations process.”“Obviously, we have to get through the shutdown, but there's bipartisan desire to get something done and to avoid a full-year CR,” Schatz said, adding that it’s hard to do anything with the House out of session. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee, opposes using a full-year continuing resolution over negotiating bipartisan versions of the full-year government funding bills. “I am concerned about a full-year CR, and I do think that we should get back to the appropriations process and get those bills done,” Shaheen said. “I think there's interest on both sides of the aisle to do that.”Uncharted watersWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the top Democrat on the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations subcommittee, said that GOP leaders will have to accept the regular give-and-take of bipartisan negotiations if they want to get anything through the upper chamber. “I think first and foremost, we have to really make sure that Speaker (Mike) Johnson recognizes that the only way forward with appropriations and other matters is a bipartisan way forward,” Baldwin said. “That's the only way you pass things that require 60 votes in the Senate.”Baldwin said that means both chambers should use the total spending level that received bipartisan backing in the Senate Appropriations Committee, not the lower spending level used by the House panel. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, was far more pessimistic than many of his colleagues.“I think you’re living in a world that does not exist,” Murphy told States Newsroom. “I think 2025 is totally unlike every other year that has existed before. Our democracy is literally dying under our feet. The president is engaged in mass scale illegality and corruption, and nothing that we have done here in the past will be precedent for what will happen in the future. The House of Representatives has never boycotted Washington for a month-and-a-half. The majority party has never refused to negotiate with the minority party. So I think we're in really uncharted waters, and nothing can happen until the House Republicans return and Senate Republicans decide to negotiate.”",,,,2025-10-21 17:18:06.440993

Details of services
A celebration of Lanny’s life will be held Sunday, October 26, at 2 p.m. at Trinity Episcopal Church in Shelburne with a reception to follow. 
In lieu of flowers, contributions in Lanny’s name may be made to Trinity Episcopal Church of Shelburne, 5171 Shelburne Road, Shelburne, VT 05482 or Hinesburg Community Resource Center, PO Box 444, Hinesburg, VT 05461.

Landon Dennison Jr. died at his home in Hinesburg, VT on Friday, October 10, 2025. He was 89 years old.

Known to all as Lanny, he was born in Princeton, N.J. on January 22, 1936. He attended Deerfield Academy and graduated from Princeton University in 1958 and was a proud Princeton Tiger ever after.
In 1957 while working at the Lake Placid Club, Lanny Dennison met the love of his life, a beautiful Canadian woman named Alison Elizabeth Holland. They married on July 4th, 1960.
After graduating from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Lanny served as the medical officer for extended length patrols aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, SSBN-602 out of Groton, Connecticut.
His Vermont connections started early in life and ran deep. He spent summers as a camper and counselor at Keewaydin Camp on Lake Dunmore, where his parents worked each summer. This ignited his lifelong love of the outdoors, leading to summer jobs as a Ranger in Yosemite National Park and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. An avid fly-fisherman and hunter, Lanny loved his annual trips to deer camp and teaching his children and grandchildren to hunt.
In 1970, after completing his residency at Mary Hitchcock Hospital in Dartmouth while living in Norwich, Vt, Lanny and his young family moved into a ramshackle farmhouse on Town Road #8 in Hinesburg. Over the next 55 years they restored the house to its original 1789 condition (with the much appreciated addition of central heat).
The young doctor opened his dermatology practice, now Four Seasons Dermatology, traveling to the Northeast Kingdom, Middlebury & St. Albans. He never turned away a patient, taking payment in eggs, crocheted afghans, and even feed for his daughter’s horse. Lanny was a sole practitioner his entire career, which he said allowed him to spend more time with his patients than a modern group practice would allow. It wasn’t unusual for him to stop by a patient’s home after church on Sunday. 
A true Renaissance man, Lanny tied his own flies and took up horology in his later years to keep the family antique clocks working. He was a voracious reader, starting and ending his days with a book on diverse subjects, with his most recent read about an 18th century Scottish philosopher.
Lanny and Alison spent their summers on their sail boat exploring the bays and islands of Lake Champlain. They also adventured with friends in Europe, Greece, Panama and Nova Scotia, among other places. 
Lanny leaves behind his wife of 65 years, Alison Holland Dennison; four children and their spouses Meg Dennison and Tim Peek of Santa Cruz, CA, Bill and Deb Dennison of South Burlington, VT, Andrew and Alison Dennison of Hinesburg, VT, Michael and Tiffany Dennison of Lincoln, VT; nine grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, brother Tom and Marianne Dennison of Farmville, VA. He is predeceased by his parents W. Landon and Louise Dennison Sr.

Cheers erupted Monday after the Durham City Council unanimously approved an amendment to the city’s housing code that prohibits landlord from collecting rent if a housing unit is found to be “imminently dangerous” to tenants’ health and safety.
Under the new ordinance, which is modeled after one in Charlotte, landlords can be charged with a misdemeanor if they collect rent on housing that has immediately dangerous conditions such as rotted or damaged structural supports, unsafe wiring, unsafe roofs, no potable water supply or no operating heating equipment in cold months, among other violations.
The city’s housing code gives landlords up to 72 hours to fix violations. If they do not, landlords can be found in violation of the new ordinance.
“The police aren’t gonna go and arrest them [landlords], but if that ends up going to court, the tenant has a very good chance of winning and being able to get not only a portion of their rent back, but all their rent back if the tenant takes the landlord to court,” C.R. Clark, an organizer with the Triangle Tenant Union, said in an interview.
Meanwhile, if the landlord takes the tenant to court and tries to evict them, the ordinance can serve as a defense for the tenant: the landlord can’t evict the tenant for not paying rent because the landlord can’t legally collect rent when an apartment is falling apart or if it is dangerous, Clark said.
The Triangle Apartment Association pushed backed against the amendment.
“While we understand there may exist some circumstances in which residents experiences less than habitable conditions, it is our belief that those circumstances do not involve the greater majority of housing providers,” the association said in a letter to the council.
The association argued that the language in the amendment could confuse residents and falsely lead them to believe they don’t have to pay rent if they believe an apartment is in violation of the ordinance.
“If anything, it [the ordinance] will have a tendency to drive more summary ejectment filings because of the withholding of rent,” the association said.
Clark stressed that it is illegal for tenants to withhold rent for infractions. The amendment is intended to give tenants an extra tool to force landlords to make critical repairs or address tenants’ safety concerns, he said, not minor issues.
“We definitely don’t want that message out there because that can burn tenants,” Clark said.
Monday’s 7-0 council vote made Durham the third municipality to adopt an ordinance prohibiting landlords from collecting rent if apartments or houses are deemed unsafe. In addition to Charlotte, Pittsboro also has such an ordinance in place.

City Councilwoman Chelsea Cook, a leading supporter of the amendment, said it adds teeth to city’s Neighborhood Improvement Services Department, which oversees the Code Enforcement Division.
“Our city code inspectors used to have the ability to enforce their inspections,” Cook said. “We used to have a criminalized component to that. The criminalization component was stripped by the state.”
Nick MacLeod, executive director of the NC Tenants’ Union, said the amendment provides tenants with much needed protection against unscrupulous landlords.
“I think it’s a widespread and deep problem,” MacLeod said. “It’s not all housing, but we don’t write law for people who are doing the right thing. We write laws to make sure that people are protected and this is a really critical step forward in making sure that residents are protected from being take advantage of in these dangerous conditions.”
The council’s vote came after dozens of residents shared harrowing stories of living in dangerous and squalid conditions.
Brenda Solomon, a Triangle Tenant Association tenant leader, said she was forced to spend rent money on a refrigerator for her insulin because the landlord wouldn’t repair the one in her apartment.
“That expense left me behind on rent and now my landlord is trying to evict me because I had to do his job for him,” Solomon said. “We need this ordinance so tenants like me don’t face the consequences for our landlord’s failures”
Brianda Barrera, a Durham renter and member of the Triangle Tenant Union, said the ordinance is a step toward “justice, health and dignity.”

“This ordinance is a shield for the most vulnerable members of our community,” Barrera said. “It’s for our elderly neighbors living with black mold who are afraid to complain for fear of retaliation from landlords who only view them as an obstacle to profits. It’s for our undocumented neighbors enduring severe pest infestations because their landlord counts on their silence.”
During an Oct. 9 work session, speakers told council members that immigrant tenants sometimes did not report unsafe living conditions because of language barriers and fear of legal status.
“Whenever they try to mention anything, they are told that the landlords will alert ICE and that will flag something in the system,” said Ken Chiha, director of Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Durham. “So the danger gets worse and worse every day.”
Public housing residents and recipients of Housing Choice Vouchers, also known as Section 8 vouchers, directed their criticism at Durham Housing Authority, nonprofit housing developers and management firms selected to run low-income housing apartments.
“I’m a resident at Willard Street [Apartments] and we’ve had so many complaints, so many maintenance problems, so many retaliations [for making complaints],” said Cynthia Hoskins. “
Across the state, 194,526 families faced an eviction filing this year, according to the N.C. Housing Coalition. Forty-eight percent of the state’s renters are burdened by housing costs, according to the coalition. That means they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.
In Durham, 6,918 families faced an eviction filing, according to the coalition and 47% of renters are burdened by housing costs.
The effort to change the ordinance was led by members of Riverside High School Affordable Housing Club and others who lobbied the council to increase protections for tenants.

Milo Graber, a Riverside senior who founded the student group, said he was driven to do so because affordable housing is a major issue in Durham that affects “lots of people, including a lot of Durham Public Schools students.” The ordinance will encourage landlords to properly maintain housing, he said.
“A lot of students live in unsafe housing, unhealthy conditions and are living in fear of getting evicted due to being charged such high levels of rent,” Graber said. “They can be evicted, and that’s very disruptive, especially when they are forced to move school districts because they have to find housing in a different area.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5040-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-21 17:18:06.440993

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)New internal polling conducted by Impact Research shows Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is seeking the Democratic Party nomination for governor in 2026, with a commanding lead compared to her opponents in the primary field.
The polling obtained by Michigan Advance has Benson ahead of the two other major candidates in the race; Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II by 39 percentage points among those tapped by Impact Research, while Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson was behind Benson by 51 percentage points.
Although the sample size was relatively small – the poll interviewed just 453 people and had a margin of error of +/- 4.6% – the data is some of the latest polling in a race that hasn’t seen a decent temperature check since the beginning of the year.
Still, the internal data collected between Sept. 30 and Oct. 6 shows Benson’s advantage compared to the rest of the field.
Benson’s favorability among primary voters was high and exceeded her opponents in Gilchrist and Swanson. The secretary of state was polled as being 77% favorable and 13% unfavorable, with an 89% share of name recognition in the race. Polling on how well she’s handled her job as secretary of state shows she has a 83% positive rating, Impact Research said.
Comparatively, Gilchrist’s name ID in the Impact poll was relatively low, while Swanson’s name ID was slightly higher.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Gilchrist nor Swanson were rated at more than 60% on the favorability scale, with the lieutenant governor netting a 55% favorability rating and the sheriff garnering a 13% favorability rating, Impact Research said.
Overall, the nearly 500 people questioned in the poll said they preferred Benson at 56%, compared to those who preferred Gilchrist at 17% and those who would be pulling for Swanson at 5%.
If the race was just between Benson and Gilchrist, the secretary of state still comes out on top, the polling suggested. For those who view both favorably, the data shows that more than half of the primary electorate views Benson as 60% favorable in the race to take on the presumptive Republican candidate as well as independent candidate Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan in November of next year. That’s compared to Gilchrist’s 26% favorability rating among that cohort.
At least 23% of those polled said they were still undecided in the race, giving Gilchrist an opportunity to make up more ground before the August 2026 primary.
The data also shows that Benson leads among key demographic groups, including both white and black primary voters, men and women, younger and older voters, and across the ideological spectrum of Democratic primary voters.
When asked for a comment on the poll and its findings, and if the campaign had also done any recent polling that showed Gilchrist in better command of the race, Danya Rafiqi, manager for the Gilchrist campaign, poured cold water on the Impact Research findings.
“Cooking up a bogus internal poll to get a headline is a tired political trick. While other candidates use gimmicks to build a narrative about their support, Garlin Gilchrist is focused on building genuine support,” Rafiqi said in a statement to the Advance. “Garlin has the momentum in this race because he’s laser focused on defeating MAGA John James and because he’s actually showing up in every community, meeting with voters and building support on college campuses, shop floors, and main streets all across Michigan.”
Messages seeking comment from Swanson’s campaigns, and requests for any internal polling they might have available, were not returned at the time of publication.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over 680,000 Oklahomans could have their food assistance benefits cut off next week if the federal government shutdown doesn’t end, state leaders said Tuesday. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has notified state leaders that federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be suspended beginning Nov. 1 if Congress has not reached an agreement to fund the program also known as food stamps. 
“I think there is a real concern on what that looks like from a hunger security perspective, from a malnutrition perspective, from a vulnerable adult or child perspective, in the month of November because you’re talking about significant impacts to over 600,000 Oklahomans,” said Jeffrey Cartmell, Oklahoma Department of Human Services director. His agency administers Oklahoma’s program.
Cartmell said beneficiaries who currently have SNAP funds for October can continue to use those through the end of the month, but the agency doesn’t know if any carryover funds can be used in November nor if funds will be retroactively available once the shutdown ends. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Cartmell said communication from Oklahoma Human Services about the cuts was set to be sent to SNAP beneficiaries on Tuesday. 
Jessica Dietrich, director of government relations and public policy for Hunger Free Oklahoma, said there is a lot of anxiety about SNAP funding, especially because no one knows the answers to beneficiaries’ questions.

“I wouldn’t say (people are) well informed, but that’s more because no one really knows what’s going on,” she said. “But I would say SNAP participants are very aware that there could be effects.”
Hunger Free Oklahoma is an organization working to ensure all Oklahomans have access to affordable, nutritious food. The group has a contract with Oklahoma Department of Human Services for SNAP education and outreach, Dietrich said. 
Dietrich said the group is recommending SNAP participants to stay “plugged in” and aware of the situation, take advantage of opportunities to stock up on food and supplies, and to take information as it comes rather than panic. 
Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton, chair of the House Human Services budget committee, hosted an interim study Tuesday on changes to SNAP and potential solutions for the state. 
“Personally I’m very disappointed in our Congress, and I hope that soon rather than later they can find an agreement to reopen our federal government,” he said. 
Federal changes to SNAP
Further changes to SNAP are coming as a result of Congress passing House Resolution 1, or the Big Beautiful Bill, in July. Two major changes are shifting more responsibility to the states to pay for administrative costs and requiring states pay a greater share of SNAP based on their error rate, Cartmell said. 
Beginning Oct. 1, 2026, states will have to pay a greater share of SNAP’s administrative costs, shifting from a 25/75 split to a 50/50 split. 
“The total estimated cost to run the program in that fiscal year is $136 million, the current state share is at $68.3 million,” Cartmell said. “The prop state share once it changes, prorating it for the nine out of 12 months, brings it further up to $102.4 million.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The second change would require Oklahoma and other states to pay for a portion of the awarded SNAP benefits based on the state’s error rate. 
Error rates are not necessarily fraud or “nefarious” actors, but can refer to SNAP beneficiaries failing to update their income or household composition in a timely manner, Cartmell said. 
“I don’t think that our clients aren’t updating because they don’t want to update,” he said. “I think if you’re a single parent or you’ve got a lot of stress in your life, the last thing probably running through your mind is, ‘I’m going to go on this government website and update my information.’”
The higher a state’s SNAP error rate, the more they’ll have to contribute to the program based on a sliding scale. Cartmell said Oklahoma’s error rate is at 10.87%, so to continue operating SNAP as is Oklahoma will have to match 15% of the funds which equates to an additional $248 million. 
Oklahoma’s error rate would have to be below 6% to pay no additional matching funds. 
Cartmell said Oklahoma’s error rate has “steadily” increased due to several factors, one being understaffed by 1,000 employees. 
This change isn’t set to go into effect until October 2027, he said. 
Rep. Danny Williams, R-Seminole, said Oklahoma needs to find a way to reduce its error rate. 
“We’ve got to resolve this,” he said. “We can’t afford not to be below 6%.”

DemasOne of two bicameral earmark transparency bills moved through the Michigan Senate on Tuesday, moving it now to the House of Representatives, where it might face some pushback.
The upper chamber on Tuesday passed Senate Bill 596 on a 31-5 vote, with Sens. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway), Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), Lana Theis (R-Brighton) and Kevin Daley (R-Lum) voting no.
Senate Bill 596 is tie-barred with House Bill 4420, the House counterpart to the legislation, so they need to pass and be signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in tandem to become law. Although Senate Bill 596 still has to clear hurdles in the House, the House version has reached the Senate floor and just needs an affirmative vote in the upper chamber to move to the governor’s desk.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Both bills would institute in statute a set of earmark transparency rules that were agreed to during the final stretch of the 2025-26 budget cycle, following the House’s inclusion of the guidelines into its chamber rules just before budget talks began.
The new conditions for earmarks under SB 596 would include the name of the lawmaker introducing the earmark, the total amount requested, the name of the intended recipient and the purpose of the earmark. The request must also include an attestation that no conflict of interest existed between the legislator or the state and the recipient, and that the recipient is not a for-profit entity.

All earmarks in the new regime must also not be distributed to a state agency or department, and is only a one-time appropriation in any future budget bill. Any program or request put forward in the governor’s budget recommendations would not qualify for a legislatively directed spending request.
The full Senate voted to not adopt the substitute to Senate Bill 596 previously adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee last week. State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) offered on Tuesday a floor substitute in its place, and Anthony’s amendment was adopted without discussion.
The same scenario played out for House Bill 4420, with its previous amendment adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee scuttled for a new floor amendment offered by Anthony and adopted by the full Senate.
State Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), who also serves as the chair of the Michigan Republican Party, offered an amendment to require that all earmarks have a cooling off period 60 days before they are voted on so the public and the media can scrutinize the projects.
The Runestad amendment failed.

Lindsey said the passage was a bittersweet moment because progress was being made, but he still considered the bill in its final form a missed opportunity.
“On a technical level, when you go through it, there are just too many gaps. There are too many problems. We just saw an amendment attempted to make sure there’s a sufficient amount of time to review these and that was rejected,” Lindsey said. “We just saw a largely party line vote rejecting the idea that we have enough opportunity for people to review these items and actually see what they are before voting on it. But there are also carve outs in there. There are spaces where people can still take advantage of the process.”
Lindsey added that an even larger concern was that this was being placed in statute rather than putting it forward as a joint rule for the entire Legislature.

“If we were to use the joint rules to create a process for budget transparency, that would be a very effective tool. It would be difficult to suspend those rules, because it would take both chambers,” Lindsey said. “Importantly, when we’re actually doing budget negotiations and passing those bills, it would provide an actual mechanism of recourse where we could object to the process. We could highlight if the rules are not being followed. If we do this legislatively, instead, we’re going to end up with a law that tells the Legislature how we have to do budget transparency.”
He also predicted that a future Legislature may ignore this new law, find ways around it or challenge it later.
State Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton) said she has concerns with the way the Senate bill bans for-profit entities from getting earmarks, comments she shared with the committee. Theis also had issues with the timing and the lack of a long review period, echoing some of Runestad’s commentary.
Despite those defections, the bill passed, but the lack of a cooling off and review period was a non-starter for House lawmakers who will now consider the Senate version of earmark reforms.
Notably, the Senate version that passed on Tuesday includes a slim 10-day window to scrutinize earmark requests.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) helped craft the House’s version of the policy, which his team lovingly called the “Hall Ethics, Accountability and Transparency” plan, or HEAT for short. 
Without a cooling off period and less stringent rules than what the House adopted earlier this year, Hall referred to the Senate’s bill as “fake HEAT” or a “smokescreen.”
“Ten days’ disclosure is a joke,” Hall told reporters during House session on Tuesday. “I told [Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks] that you want a long disclosure period because there’s a lot of things that your members are trying to do that are very sneaky that you’re going to find out about in the press.  And it’s going to save you.”
Hall suggested a 90-day window to scrutinize requests, larger than the window offered by Runestad in the upper chamber, and that it would not move forward in the lower chamber until a long review window is added.
In a statement following the chamber’s passage of Senate Bill 596, state Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare), sponsor of House Bill 4420, said he was encouraged by the progress the Legislature was making toward better reforms, but also said the 10-day window was insufficient.
“We need to agree on a clear, firm deadline, whether that’s April 1 or another reasonable date, so taxpayers can count on when earmark requests will be made public,” he said. “Having a set date is key to ensuring there are no surprises and that the process remains consistent year after year.”
Kunse called for the House to improve on the Senate’s plan. His bill would require all proposed earmarks to be disclosed by April 1, well before the July 1 statutory deadline and the Oct. 1 constitutional deadline to pass a budget.
“Michiganders deserve a process that’s predictable, open, and accountable,” Kunse said. “We’ve seen cases where funds have gone to organizations with little transparency or local connection. I look forward to continuing conversations with the Senate to find common ground and deliver a stronger, more transparent budget process.”
Republican lawmakers were the only ones to comment on the legislation prior to its passage.

Mexican ranchers’ current inability to ship roughly 1,500 cattle per day into the United States through New Mexico’s ports of entry continues to have wide-reaching consequences, including layoffs and price hikes, the leader of a bi-national cooperative of livestock producers said Tuesday.
Daniel Manzanares, who is in charge of the Santa Teresa, N.M. border crossing on behalf of the cooperative, told a legislative committee Tuesday the shutdown impacts both sides of the border, forcing Mexican ranchers with smaller operations to sell their cattle at a loss, while the price of beef in the United States reaches new heights. 
In July, United States Agriculture Department Secretary Brooke Rollins ordered a halt in cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the New World screwworm, a parasitic fly. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets.
Mexican authorities have detected the screwworm three times within 100 miles or so of the Southeast Texas border in recent weeks. Rollins has said the border won’t reopen as long as the worm continues to be detected in northern Mexico. 
NM hunters asked to look out for New World Screwworm after recent detections in Mexico

The department is working on a plan to produce hundreds of millions of sterile screwworm flies to eradicate the population. 
But until then, the shutdown has upended the $1 billion industry that the port of entry facilitates each year, Manzanares said, and the longer it stays shut, the more unintended consequences will arise, he warned. 
“It affected everyone in northern Mexico pretty bad. But not only in Mexico, here in the United States,” he said, before listing off beef-related industries affected: “Your grow yards, your feed yards, your drivers, your buyers, your brokers. People are selling houses. I mean, it’s a pretty bad thing to shut the border over something like that.”
Manzanares’ group, the Unión Ganadera Regional De Chihuahua Co-op, owns the cattle crossing, and Mexican and American agriculture departments are on both sides of the border inspecting imported cattle before they are released. 
The shutdown meant that Manzares had to lay off more than half of his 32 farm hands, he said. 
Just north of the New Mexico border, Mexican ranchers often bring their cattle over the border to feed lots before putting the animals up for sale and slaughter. Mexican ranchers also raise a breed of roping cattle popular across the nation for rodeos, Manzanares said, along with other breeds for other uses.
According to Manzaneres’ presentation, roughly half of all annual cattle imports into the United States have come through New Mexico ports of entry in recent years. In 2024, for example, about 630,000 of 1.25 million cattle came through Santa Teresa or Columbus ports of entry, with the rest accessing through nine entry ports across Arizona and Texas. 
Santa Teresa cattle border crossing reopening scrapped after screwworm movement in Mexico

Now that those figures have fallen to zero, beef prices have continued to increase. According to a September price outlook from the USDA, cattle prices reached record highs in August and September, with slaughter steers now selling for more than $240 per 100 lbs. That’s an increase of $54 per 100 lbs over last year, according to the outlook, and prices are expected to continue to increase.
Beef operations holding their animals in feedlots for longer factors into the increase, according to the USDA, which they are doing in response to the lack of Mexican imports.
State Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia), a former cattle grower himself, said the increased prices benefit ranchers but hurt everyone else. 
“Even a bad rancher can make money in this market, but I would say that comes at a cost,” he said. “Many of my buddies would kick me in the shins if they heard me say [it], but cattle prices [are] too high right now. And it’s to the point that it’s going to cause reactions, and that reaction, long term, I don’t believe will be good for the market.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cattle-Export-lots-1024x441.jpg,,,2025-10-21 16:57:24.139891

(File photo by Getty Images)A California-headquartered water filter maker announced plans Tuesday to make Walterboro the home of its first East Coast manufacturing operations.
QMP, Inc., pledged to hire at least 233 people over the next five years. The company plans to invest $5.1 million in a 22,000-square-foot facility that previously housed a printing business.
The 30-year-old company based in Valencia, Calif., makes water filtration systems for both residential and commercial use. It will be looking for skilled craftsman, as well as general operators and laborers to run the facility in rural Colleton County, according to Brantley Strickland, who heads the county’s economic development alliance.
“While many manufacturers have chosen to move production overseas, QMP remains deeply committed to American manufacturing. Expanding into South Carolina allows us to continue building on more than three decades of excellence and innovation — right here in the United States,” QMP Vice President Vanessa Vidal Forsyth said in a statement.
The average wage, Strickland said, will be $25 per hour, which is a couple of dollars above the current county average.
Colleton County sees about 10,400 of its residents commute outside the county every day for work — about 15% of those for manufacturing jobs, Strickland said. QMP would offer an opportunity closer to home.
“Hopefully this can give some of those people a couple hours back in their day and put a little more money in their pocket,” Strickland said.
If QMP meets its jobs projections, it would become Colleton County’s largest manufacturer, Strickland said.
By comparison, food and beverage maker Gehl Foods employs 140 people in the county since coming to South Carolina in June 2022.
The building QMP plans to move into has been vacant since the printing company shuttered in 2020, Strickland said. QMP plans to buy an additional five acres and add on to the existing space.
In exchange for the company’s investment, Colleton County Council is considering a deal to offer the company tax breaks, though the details of that agreement aren’t yet publicly available. It will likely be December before a deal is finalized, Strickland said,
The state has approved the county for corporate income tax credits worth $20,250 per new job, as well as a $250,000 grant to help pay for improvements to the property.
Operations are expected to begin in January 2026. Those wishing to apply can email QMP at info@qmpusa.com.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/waterpfascancer-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-10-21 16:57:24.139891

He jumped every time his phone rang, anticipating a call from his attorney, Norm Pattis, telling him that the jury had returned with a verdict. 
But there was no verdict on Tuesday. The jury retired at 4 p.m. after asking the judge only one technical question. They are due back on Wednesday. 
The calls came from his daughters, checking in.
With a half-eaten salad in front of him, Diamantis presented a calm façade.
“I’ll deal with either outcome because I have to,” he said about the jury verdict. “Nobody can control what a jury does and what they choose to believe.”
Federal prosecutors said Diamantis took bribes in exchange for influencing lucrative school construction contracts. Pattis said Diamantis was public servant whose main concern was saving taxpayers money.
But Diamantis had a few bones to pick, especially with federal prosecutors “who don’t understand how school construction works.”
Diamantis opened his notebook and pointed to 67 different notes he had taken during the trial that he believes the jury could interpret to show his innocence.
Diamantis grew animated as he spoke, pacing around the restaurant.
When asked about his two days of testimony, Diamantis acknowledged that he’s not sure some jurors understood what he was trying to say. 
“I feel good about my testimony. Nobody loves to be cross-examined, but I believe I held my own,” Diamantis said.
As he testified, he sat looking straight at the jury, not the attorneys — a deliberate act, he said, so he could read their faces.
“I got mixed vibes from the jury,”  Diamantis said. “Some of them were nodding their heads. Some were taking a lot of notes, and some just had blank faces, but I do feel like they were paying attention.”
Diamantis talked about the support he has received during the trial from his daughters and his ex-wife Pauline, who is the sister of John Duffy, one of the state’s key witnesses.
Duffy was the vice president of Acranom Masonry, the company that federal prosecutors have accused Diamantis of getting school contracts for in exchange for $70,000. Duffy was one of the government’s key witnesses, testifying about how Diamantis hounded him for money after they got a contract at the Birch Grove School in Tolland.
During the nine-day trial, Diamantis took the witness stand in his own defense and acknowledged that Acranom paid him tens of thousands of dollars. He also admitted that his daughter was hired by Construction Advocacy Professionals, another company that was awarded work in Hartford, Tolland and New Britain.
In both cases, he said, he never used his position to benefit those contractors.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis told the jury Monday that Diamantis essentially admitted to some of the charges, namely bribery, when he acknowledged receiving payments from the two contractors.
Diamantis said it was significant that his ex-wife sat on his side of the courtroom while her brother testified.
“Any reasonable person would conclude that being exes, and she was there to support me, speaks volumes who you should believe,” Diamantis said.
Diamantis is facing a sentence that could be more than 10 years if convicted of bribery and extortion charges. He is aware of the consequences he faces.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — A bipartisan group of state lawmakers heard from nearly a dozen doctors on Tuesday who called on them to reject any proposed legislation that would remove vaccine mandates from Florida schools.
Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo and Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last month in Hillsborough County that they intend to drop all required vaccine mandates for children, including those required for school attendance such as polio, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and chickenpox.
Ladapo already holds authority to remove some vaccine requirements by simple rule changes. That means that starting in early December (taking effect 90 days after the Sept. 3 announcement), school vaccinations will no longer be required for hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type b (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate virus. That’s according to a statement sent by the Florida Department of Health that was reported by ABC News.
Others, however, including poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella are still in place and won’t be removed unless the Legislature opts to do so when it convenes for its 2026 session in January.
But a group of doctors – many of them pediatricians from the Tampa Bay area – urged members of the Hillsborough County legislative delegation on Tuesday to oppose any such proposals if they come before them early next year.
“We as physicians took an oath to do no harm, and I do think that silence in the face of preventable harm is, in and of itself, a kind of harm,” said Brandon urologist Dr. Neil Manimala, who is also a Democratic candidate for county commission in 2026. “We are here because we do not want to be silent when politics is injected into our children’s healthcare.”
“Vaccine requirements are not about government overreach, they are about public responsibility,” said Dr. Lisa M. Rush, a pediatrician with Health Care Alliance.
“They’re protecting the vulnerable and ensuring that our schools, businesses, and healthcare systems remain strong and resilient in the face of infectious disease. The question before us is not whether we support vaccines. That debate is, frankly, settled science. The question is, do we have the courage to uphold policies that have kept our state safe even when it’s politically inconvenient? True freedom isn’t the absence of regulation. It’s the presence of safety, opportunity, and the ability to live without fear of preventable illness.”
Dr. Ed Homan served as a member of the Florida House as a Republican representing parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties from 2002 to 2010. He noted how highly contagious a disease like measles is and feared what could happen if an unvaccinated child spent time at Disney World or Universal Florida.
“It wouldn’t be long before this measles outbreak starts popping up all over the country, and then it wouldn’t be long after that before we figured out where is the source of this epidemic [is] in Central Florida. So think about the economic impact of our tourism industry,” he said.
Dr. Marcy Solomon Baker, director of pediatrics at BayCare Medical Group, said that after practicing for 25 years she knows that vaccines are what’s best for children and for “our vulnerable children.”
“Children that are too young to be vaccinated; children who have cancer; children who have immune problems. They depend on herd immunity. So, if other people don’t vaccinate, it puts them at risk,” she said.
Both Ladapo and DeSantis acknowledged during their Sept. 3 press conference that they had yet to speak to any lawmaker before they went public. And although legislators are filing bills daily in advance of the regular legislative start date of Jan. 13, none has filed a bill to remove vaccine mandates.
A James Madison Institute survey released in late September of 1,200 registered Florida voters found 62% against elimination of all vaccine requirements, with just 29% in support. And a survey of 631 registered Florida voters conducted by Bendixen & Amandi International taken Sept. 7-9 found 60% opposed ending vaccine mandates and just 37% supporting it.

,DC,2025-10-21 20:48:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘A boundless power’: Dem states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/boundless-power-dem-states-ask-supreme-court-halt-trump-troop-deployment-chicago,,"Every state with either a Democratic governor, attorney general or both signed a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the justices to side with Illinois and Chicago to continue blocking President Donald Trump’s proposed deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago.In an amicus brief filed Monday in the Trump administration’s appeal to overturn lower courts’ rulings that Trump lacks the legal authority to send troops to Chicago, 24 Democratic officials argued that restraining presidential power to mobilize National Guard troops was an essential constitutional safeguard.“The President has asserted a boundless power far out of step with our Nation’s laws and tradition: the power to federalize and deploy unlimited numbers of National Guard troops at his whim and without any judicial review,” they wrote. “This Court should not endorse such a power.”State National Guard units are generally under the control of the state's governor. Federal law does allow the president to federalize state National Guard units in rare cases of invasion, insurrection or when the state is unable to enforce federal laws. The Trump administration has argued that circumstances in Chicago constitute both the threat of an insurrection and the inability of local police to enforce federal law.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have argued that lower courts correctly decided that those circumstances were not met in Chicago and Trump may therefore not deploy troops to the city.Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown and Washington state Attorney General Nicholas W. Brown led the brief. Attorneys general in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia also signed on, as did the governors of Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat whose state led its own lawsuit against Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, filed a separate amicus brief Monday.The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.Tussle over ChicagoThe case stems from Trump’s order to federalize Illinois National Guard troops and deploy them to Chicago. Trump has said the move is needed to control crime that threatens federal personnel and buildings. Pritzker and Johnson, as well as the state officials in Monday’s brief, say the use of military forces to respond to routine crime is a gross violation of the U.S. Constitution’s balance of powers.The states, even where Trump has not threatened to send troops, are in danger of losing the power granted to them by the Constitution, the officials wrote. “President Trump’s invocation of 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to deploy armed, federalized National Guard soldiers and entangle them in everyday civilian law enforcement activities like responding to small-scale protests—over the objection of Illinois’s Governor—is a stunning break from law and tradition,” they wrote, referring to the law outlining the conditions under which a president may federalize a state National Guard.High court appealU.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer filed the Trump administration emergency motion for a stay Friday. He argued that an injunction from Illinois federal court on Oct. 7 wrongfully decided the scope of the president’s power to control National Guard units.Sauer argued for a broader interpretation of Trump’s authority, saying the president alone could determine if the conditions for federalizing National Guard units had been met.“The district court’s injunction impermissibly substitutes the court’s own judgment for the President’s on military matters and rests on a construction of Section 12406 that would render the statute a virtual nullity,” Sauer wrote in the Oct. 17 motion. “The injunction improperly impinges on the President’s authority.”The Democratic officials on Monday called the assertion of such authority an overreach of presidential power.“Allowing the President to commandeer state National Guards and use them at his whim would fundamentally upset the balance of power between States and the federal government,” they wrote. “This Court should decline Defendants’ invitation to take such an unprecedented and drastic step.”",,,,2025-10-21 16:57:24.139891

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)One day after setting the timeline for awarding the state’s two dozen cannabis retail licenses, the state’s top pot industry regulator is stepping down amid expectations she will run for attorney general in 2026.
Kimberly Ahern was set to conclude her tenure as chairperson of the three-member Cannabis Control Commission — a position she has held since the panel was formed in 2023 — at the end of the day Tuesday, Gov. Dan McKee announced early Tuesday afternoon. 
“Serving the state in this capacity has been a privilege, and I am proud of what we have accomplished in such a short time,” Ahern wrote in her resignation letter submitted Tuesday to the governor. “Rhode Island has approached this new industry with care and purpose.”
Ahern highlighted the commission’s approval of its first set of rules governing the state’s recreational cannabis market, including provisions for screening equity applicants and opening applications for prospective retailers eager to enter the fledgling industry.
New R.I. cannabis retail licenses could be ready by May 2026. Not soon enough for some applicants.

“She helped stand up the commission from the ground up and ensured that Rhode Island’s cannabis industry was launched with public health, safety, and fairness as priorities,” McKee said in a statement.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in a separate statement thanked Ahern for “setting a high standard for public service.”
“Her work has positioned the Cannabis [Control] Commission for long-term success as we continue to strengthen this emerging industry,” Shekarchi said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson said Ahern’s decisions on the panel “showed her dedication to fairness and thoughtful regulation.”
“Her contributions will have a lasting impact on Rhode Island’s cannabis program,” Lawson said in a statement.
Ahern’s resignation letter does not state why she stepped down from her $204,069-a-year post, only that she looked forward to “finding new ways to serve the state.” 
It is expected that she will enter the Democratic primary to succeed Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose term as the state’s top prosecutor ends after 2026. Neronha earns $146,107 a year.
Two other Democrats have already announced their candidacies this fall: State Rep. Jason Knight and Keith Hoffmann, who worked as the chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha.
State Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was the first to announce a bid for AG, but exited four days later after past allegations of domestic violence were brought to light.
Knight had $90,419 in his campaign account as of the most recent filing from the end of June. Hoffmann’s campaign announced Oct. 6 that his account has raised $210,000 since he entered the race.
Ahern does not yet have a balance listed with the Board of Elections as of Tuesday.
But much like her potential competitors, Ahern too has worked as a state attorney. From 2010 through 2019, she served as a special assistant AG under three attorneys general: Neronha, Peter Kilmartin, and Patrick Lynch.
She then went on to serve as deputy counsel for former Gov. Gina Raimondo and went on to become the deputy chief of staff for McKee before her appointment to the Cannabis Control Commission. 
McKee’s office confirmed the search for Ahern’s successor has begun. In the meantime, the panel will continue its work under the leadership of Commissioners Layi Oduyingbo and Robert Jacquard. 
The commission’s next monthly meeting is scheduled for Nov. 21, but Ahern indicated Monday it could be sooner in order for regulators to approve final certification of prospective social equity applicants.
Day-to-day operations of the commission and the state’s newly established Cannabis Office will continue to be handled by its administrator, Michelle Reddish.

Energy watchdogs say NorthWestern Energy needs to stop hiding information about data centers from the public, and it needs to acknowledge the Public Service Commission is more than a “rubber stamp.”
Earthjustice sent two letters, dated Oct. 15 and 17, to the Public Service Commission on behalf of the Montana Environmental Information Center, Honor the Earth, and NW Energy Coalition.
The groups allege NorthWestern is moving forward on agreements with data centers without required approval from the PSC — and in violation of Montana law. The utility said it doesn’t believe it’s flouting the law.
NorthWestern Energy has announced plans to serve at least three, and as many as five, data centers, with a total load of nearly 1,175 MW in the next few years, reaching 2,250 MW by 2030, said one letter, citing various public reports from the utility.
The groups estimate NorthWestern’s daily average load could double as a result.
The planned data centers have sparked controversy in Montana, with some business interests arguing they will spur economic opportunities in the state, but customer advocates and energy watchdogs arguing the benefit isn’t worth the cost.
In an email to the Daily Montanan on Monday, NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the company should be able to help Montana benefit from the trend.
“Montana should not be left behind from benefiting from the growing data center industry,” Black said. “NorthWestern Energy is committed to supporting this economic opportunity through reliable energy service, strategic investment, and collaboration.”
In December 2024, NorthWestern Energy started touting plans to supply electricity to data centers, but it hasn’t complied with the Public Service Commission’s attempts to obtain information about the deals, the watchdogs allege in recent letters from Earthjustice.
“Nearly one year later, NorthWestern is still stonewalling and defying this Commissions’ regulatory authority,” said one of the letters, dated Oct. 15, to the Public Service Commission.
Last month, the PSC itself requested copies of all letters of intent, contracts, agreements and other information related to NorthWestern’s news releases about data centers; its evaluation methods for deciding whether service to those centers would hurt other customers; and other information.
Across the country, data centers are projected to push up electricity bills 8% in the next five years and as much as 25% in Virginia, said the second letter from Earthjustice, dated Oct. 17.
In its own letter to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern said it will provide documents, but argues it must do so under a protective order to “ensure appropriate confidentiality.”
It said some of the information the PSC wants, such as modeling approaches, are still being developed. But the state’s largest public utility said it disagrees that it’s violating PSC oversight laws by moving forward with data centers.
Montana law states that a public utility can provide service to a large retail customer if the customer shows that service won’t “adversely impact” other customers over the long term “as determined by the commission.”
(NorthWestern’s position is that the law doesn’t apply to new customers, just to ones that existed in 2007, when the law passed, although the PSC said the utility’s interpretation doesn’t align with definitions in state law.)
NorthWestern Energy’s request to file information under a protective order — which would make it available to the PSC but keep it from public view — is pending before the Public Service Commission.
However, in one recent letter, the groups represented by Earthjustice urged the PSC to deny NorthWestern’s motion, arguing it is “severely deficient and fails to provide any description of the information it is shielding from public view.”
“It also fails to provide an adequate explanation of why such information is confidential or subject to trade secret protections,” the first letter said.
In the second, 16-page letter, the groups outline the risks they believe existing ratepayers will face if NorthWestern provides service to “large load” data centers and advocate for the creation of a customer class “specific to data centers.”
The groups also underscore the Public Service Commission’s “statutory obligation to ensure that NorthWestern proves no adverse impact on existing ratepayers before agreeing to provide service to large load customers.”
The letter said a growing body of evidence shows that without proper regulation, customers are at risk of increases to their electricity bills from data centers.
Citing Harvard Law experts, the letter said “negotiated rates between utilities and data centers charged through special contracts risk cost recovery shortfalls that all other ratepayers have to later subsidize through higher bills.”
It said Duke Energy, based in North Carolina, planned to shift $325 million in energy costs supplying a data center to existing ratepayers, but that information was only discovered in litigation.
“In the normal course, private contracts between a utility and new large-load customers may never receive scrutiny to ensure ratepayers are protected,” the letter said.
The letter said new research also shows utilities need to invest in “costly transmission upgrades” to supply data centers, and in other jurisdictions, those costs are already “plaguing retail customers.”
Bills for customers of PJM, which serves 13 states in the east and the District of Columbia, already have increased “unreasonably” because the costs of data centers have been spread over all customers, not allocated to the class responsible for the costs, the letter said.
“The combined results of this cost-shifting has been dramatic in regions already experiencing data center growth,” the letter said. “The Associated Press reported that the PJM’s market watchdog calculated that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of increased electricity cost over the past year was caused by data center demand.”
In an email Monday, NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Black said new customers will pay “their share of the integration and services they require.”
In the letter from Earthjustice, the groups said NorthWestern’s decision to work on contracts before the Commission had even figured out if existing ratepayers were going to be harmed flies in face of the plain language of the law.
NorthWestern, however, said in the next couple of months it plans to file “a large load tariff” that will provide a venue for the PSC and stakeholders to “discuss the impacts” of data centers and “establish a transparent process” for evaluating service contracts.
“Our goal is to ensure that all interested parties have a clear and consistent framework for addressing these critical issues, while continuing to support Montana’s economic development and protecting existing customers,” NorthWestern said in its September letter to the PSC.
It said it plans to file letters of intent under a protective order — still pending before the PSC. It said it does not have contracts with any companies it’s mentioned in press releases yet but is working on agreements and will share them.
It said its plan to file that “large load” proceeding and submit customer contracts for “Commission review” “likely mitigates our difference of interpretation (of the law) and provides a constructive path forward.”

""No court has ordered this,"" she said. ""It's a power grab."" (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)As North Carolina lawmakers continued to advance a new congressional map Tuesday that would flip control of a northeastern swing district to favor Republicans, a former occupant of that seat visited the legislature to denounce the plan.
“You’ve done a disservice to my own people,” former U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, who represented the district from 1992 until 2003, said in a news conference. “As well as politically. You’ve taken away the political power of minorities and rural people.”
Republicans returned to Raleigh this week to swiftly push through a new map at the urging of President Donald Trump. The latest of several states to be drawn into mid-decade redistricting, North Carolina would likely send 11 Republicans and three Democrats to Washington under the plan.
Senators gave the map final approval in a vote Tuesday morning. It now moves through the House, which is expected to vote on the floor tomorrow. Redistricting plans are not subject to veto, meaning Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, cannot stop it from taking effect.
Opponents, meanwhile, have been frank in their criticism of the map, arguing that it undermines the voting power of the state’s rural Black voters in the northeast 1st Congressional District — who for decades have been represented by Black lawmakers.
That includes Clayton, who in 1992 became the first Black person elected to the U.S. House from North Carolina since George Henry White in the late 19th century. Clayton and her successors — the late Frank Ballance, G.K. Butterfield and U.S. Rep. Don Davis — have all been Black Democrats.

Clayton, in comments to reporters Tuesday, called the new map a “power grab” that would displace a congressman “sensitive to the needs” of northeast North Carolina. The 1st district’s existing boundaries and demographics, she said, required her and her successors to pay close attention to all corners of the region.
“Republicans came to my office, like Democrats came to my office,” Clayton said. “White farmers came to my office like Black farmers came to my office. And that’s how I got re-elected, really. … I’m not willing to say that I know any new person coming into that district will do that.”
During earlier debate on Monday, Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) lamented that Clayton had to watch the historic district be redrawn.
“I can only imagine the joy and pride she felt that the South, the homeplace of Jim Crow, was finally getting it right when it made history by electing her,” Murdock said. “And now, in 2025, we are on the verge of subjecting the people of the 1st congressional district to having worse representation than they did in 1992. I’m really sad that in her 91 years, she will see us roll backwards, going, yet again, in the wrong direction.”
Republicans leading the charge to redistrict have steered clear of any discussion on the map’s impact on Black voters. Instead, they have described the new map on purely partisan terms: a “simple and singular” effort to maintain GOP control in Congress.
“Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the U.S. House of Representatives,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said Monday. “And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”
Hise later added that “no racial data” was used in the construction of the new map. House majority leader Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) reiterated that Tuesday afternoon.

That distinction comes in light of a 2023 state Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for partisan gerrymandering. Redrawing maps with the specific intent to dilute the power of Black voters remains against the law; the current 1st district is part of a pending federal lawsuit alleging as much.
Any lawsuits challenging the map, which are all but certain, will likely involve Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act. But opponents to the map are wary of a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court that questions the constitutionality of that section. Clayton urged those in North Carolina not to let that prevent them from pushing back against the new district lines.
“Don’t defeat yourselves,” she said.
Hise said Monday that “we will defend these maps, and I am confident [the maps] will be held by the courts.”
Davis: ‘All options on the table’
Davis, who narrowly won a second term in the House last November, said in a statement Tuesday that he was “considering all options on the table” for his political future.
“That would include considering a run in both the new [1st district] as well as the new [3rd district],” Davis said in a statement.

Davis’ home is located in the new 3rd district, but U.S. representatives are not required to live within the bounds of their district. If he chose to run in the 3rd district, he would likely face a fellow incumbent in U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, who has held the seat since 2019.
Davis said since his term began, his office had received more than 46,000 messages from constituents across party lines. “Not a single one” requested redrawing the district, he said.
“Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,” Davis said.
Public protests and criticism of new map continues
Lawmakers’ new map continued to draw scrutiny and protesters from the public Tuesday, after vocal objections during debate and ejections from the Senate gallery on Monday.
An organized protest in front of the old Capitol Building on Tuesday drew more than a hundred people as Democratic leaders called on supporters to continue making their opposition known.
“Legislators, congresspeople, should not pick their constituents,” U.S. Rep. Alma Adams said from the stage. “Constituents, it’s your job … to pick your members of Congress.”
And members of the public, including Clayton and Adams, again packed the committee room later Tuesday to criticize the map in over an hour of public comment.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said lawmakers had received more than 11,200 public comments online about the map. The 2023 redistricting plan, she said, drew about 600 comments, and the 2021 plan drew about 1,000.

“Everything about this process is so wrong,” Harrison said during the House committee hearing. “I’m just so angry about what we’re doing to our democracy today.”
Protesters were escorted from the committee room shortly before lawmakers voted on party lines to approve the bill, chanting “Berger’s maps are racist maps.”

Trenton, New Jersey
Died Sept. 11, 2025
St. Johnsbury, Vermont

Thomas Turner of Peacham, Vermont passed away on September 11, 2025 at Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital in St. Johnsbury of natural causes.
Tom was born on March 18, 1940 in Trenton, New Jersey, and was a graduate of Pennington Preparatory School in Pennington, NJ. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the US Navy where he served on the USS Forrestal until 1961. During his time in the Navy, he worked as a journalist. When returning home he was employed by New Jersey Manufacturers as an underwriter. Tom then spent time pursuing travel, eventually moving to Marshfield, Vermont in 1974. There, he opened his own business, Behind the Times Garage. Throughout his life, he worked for Cabot Creamery, Bombardier, and Napa Auto Parts. He also owned Turner Sports in West Danville during the late 1990s. Tom lived throughout central Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom and ultimately settled in Peacham Corner in 2006 with his wife Tamsen Van derLas.
A lifelong “gearhead” mechanic, Tom found happiness in working on cars and motorcycles. He always had a unique vehicle in his garage, from box trucks, motorcycles, vans, and of course, old American sedans. His most notable and prize motorcycle was the 1940 Indian Chief he built from parts. He even dabbled in vintage motorcycle racing well after the time he should have been retired – one of his favourite later memories was racing around New Hampshire Motor Speedway in a professional racing bike. Tom spent many summers as a judge with the Vermont Automobile Enthusiasts, admiring antique cars at the Stowe car show. Tom was also a gunsmith and avid collector. He loved animals, and you could often find him watching birds from the window with a dog and cat by his side.


He is predeceased by his parents Irvine Agnew “Jack” and Jeanne Stratton Turner, sister Karen Bragdon, and wife Tamsen Van derLas of almost 20 years. He is survived by his three children Tracy Turner of New Jersey, William Turner (wife Lisa) of Alberta, Canada and Tamsen Turner of Vermont.

A federal judge has found a former California man accused of setting a fire outside the Burlington office of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2024 not competent to assist in his defense.
Judge William K. Sessions III wrote in a ruling last week that 36-year-old Shant Soghomonian, who has been detained since his arrest days after the incident, would remain in federal custody.
The judge added that, while in custody, Soghomonian shall receive treatment in a “suitable facility for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months” to determine whether “he will attain capacity to permit the proceeding to go forward.”

Sessions wrote that the director at the facility treating Soghomonian will file a report “detailing the status of treatment and probability of improvement.”
Then, the judge wrote, he will review that report to decide how to move forward in the case. 
At this point, Sessions wrote, Soghomonian is unable to assist properly in his defense. 
Soghomonian was accused of setting fire to the entryway leading to Sanders’ office in the historic downtown building on Church Street on April 5, 2024.

The independent senator was not in the office at the time, and none of his seven staffers who were in the building was physically injured, according to court records.
The building, which also housed businesses including a law firm and bank, sustained water damage, and the door leading to the senator’s office was charred, the court documents stated.
Soghomonian, who in the past had lived in California, had been renting rooms in hotels around Chittenden County in the days leading up to the fire, according to court records.
Sessions, in his ruling, wrote that he relied on reviews of Soghomonian by mental health experts in finding him not competent to assist in his own defense. 
The judge also wrote that Soghomonian made statements in court during an earlier hearing that the federal public defender’s office as well as prosecutors were “suppressing the truth” and that officials were covering up violence and terror from the government.
“He is too suspicious of the legal proceedings and his own defense counsel to assist properly in his own defense,” Sessions wrote.
At a hearing in the case in federal court in Burlington in August, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Lasher, a prosecutor, argued that Soghomonian was not competent, while Charles Curlett Jr., representing Soghomonian, contended that his client was competent. 
Sessions took the matter under advisement, leading to his written ruling last week.

Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, said the bill he will file in 2026 is nearly identical to ones from previous years. One change, though, ensures water districts cannot be sued for their decision to either add or not add fluoride to the water. 
“Water districts will be immune from any type of civil litigation regardless of which direction they go, whether they keep fluoride in the water or take it out,” Hart said. 
Several lawmakers also floated the idea of a statewide ban on fluoride in drinking water. 
Water fluoridation would become optional in KY under bill advanced by House committee

Dental and health advocacy organizations sent a letter to the committee stressing the importance of water fluoridation for oral health. 
“Maintaining comprehensive community water fluoridation programs promotes a healthy, more engaged workforce,” the letter said. “A higher prevalence of dental problems impacts Kentuckians’ ability to work and learn, with employees missing more work to address their own dental treatment needs, or to support their children’s needs, as kids are nearly three times more likely to miss school when they have poor oral health. Jeopardizing water fluoridation programs will lead to increased healthcare costs and disparities in oral health outcomes, particularly among low-income and underserved populations.” 
Hart and other bill supporters stressed that they want to promote local control rather than litigate the pros and cons of fluoride. 
“The United States is a free country. We do not dictate any medical treatment to anybody,” Hart said. “It’s always a choice between the patient and their doctor. The same thing needs to apply to dental medicine.” 
Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Lousiville, took issue with that. 
“One of the comments made was that we have to have choice and not be involved in medicine, and we don’t do that, but we certainly do in the General Assembly, because we’ve taken away the right of women for reproduction rights,” she said. “So we do, in the General Assembly, make decisions on health care all the time.”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation previously announced five arrests of people linked to the alleged illegal horserace gambling operation in Wilder called La Catedral Arena. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday confirmed ICE’s arrest count. 
“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation …,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement. “As part of the operation ICE law enforcement officers arrested 105 illegal aliens. Under President Trump and (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem, we are dismantling criminal networks in the United States.”
After FBI raid in southwest Idaho, advocates denounce ‘military-style’ tactics and detaining kids

FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker previously said ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division helped “process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation. Their presence was limited to that specific federal responsibility and was separate from the criminal gambling investigation being led by the FBI.”
Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets. 
The FBI canceled a press conference scheduled Monday, saying law enforcement officials didn’t have more information to share publicly beyond a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The document details the investigation, but does not specify law enforcement’s tactics during the raid.
“The government came in full force, military-style, helicopters, drones and arrested and handcuffed, everyone … including children,” ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales told reporters at a news conference Monday. “No person, no Idahoan, no American should ever accept whenever a government does this to its own people.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball is asking Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration to dip further into a pot of money he used to temporarily fund senior meals to pay for  a long-stalled law to help kinship care families. 
On Monday, Beshear announced his administration transferred $9.1 million to fund the senior meal program a month after pandemic-era funding expired. The temporary funding came from a $25 million pot of money for a previously-funded study that never took place and will help fund senior meals through the fiscal year. 
In a Tuesday letter, Ball said the remaining $15.9 million in that pot should go to fund Senate Bill 151, passed in 2024 with the goal of giving much-needed financial relief to families raising minor relatives. The legislature didn’t fund SB151, which Beshear signed and the cabinet initially said would cost $20 million to implement. The parties have fought in court over the issue since May, when Ball sued. 
On Oct. 14, the cabinet filed regulations on the law that updated the estimated cost to implement from $20 million to $14.7 million, according to a copy attached to Ball’s letter. 
“Your administration has a constitutional duty to do what it just did elsewhere — reallocate what it needs from that remaining $15.9 million to execute the kinship care bil l,” Ball wrote. “Even though that amount of money more than covers the alleged $14.7 million annual cost of the kinship care bill, I would encourage your administration to recalculate that estimated cost. The true cost of executing the kinship care bill may be much lower than that, if anything at all.” 
The Lantern has asked the cabinet to comment.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds said at a Tuesday news conference she plans to use the Iowa DOGE task force’s report to make recommendations to the state Legislature in 2026 — including on ways to lower property tax costs.
The Iowa DOGE task force, convened in February, was based on the federal U.S. Department of Government Efficiency program formerly led by billionaire Elon Musk in the Trump administration. The group of Iowa business leaders, led by Emily Schmitt, general counsel for Sukup Manufacturing Co., met multiple times and held several public meetings over the next several months before submitting their final report Sept. 29.
Though the report was submitted in late September, the list of 45 finalized recommendations had not been shared until Tuesday. Now, the report is publicly available through the governor’s website.
At a news conference Tuesday, Reynolds said the DOGE task force was convened to continue work she has focused on as governor to make government more efficient, pointing to the 2023 law she signed on realigning state government that reduced the state’s 37 executive-level cabinet agencies down to 16, as well as other recent laws to cut and restructure state boards and commissions, as well as the Iowa behavioral health system.

“I have always believed that it is important that we never settle, that we continue to look for ways to be more effective, efficient and accountable to the taxpayers of Iowa,” Reynolds said.
When task force members released their initial recommendations in August and September meetings, there was significant pushback against certain proposed changes — specifically regarding the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS), and tying extra compensation for K-12 public school teacher and administrators to student achievement.
The governor said “there’s been a lot of public speculation, not to mention misinformation about the potential changes to state benefits that state employees, law enforcement officers, teachers and others rely on” as recommended by the task force.
“You can rest assured that IPERS will be there for your retirement just as you’ve planned and we’ve promised — and that, by the way, was the intent of the task force from the very beginning,” Reynolds said.
The task force had suggested moving IPERS from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program, in which both the employee and employer would contribute to a retirement benefit plan. This recommendation, introduced in August, was scaled back during later meetings. Terry Lutz, who chaired a work group within the Iowa DOGE task force, said the task force would recommend the state conduct an ongoing study of public employees’ benefits, including consideration of the viability of a defined contribution plan. The recommendation suggests public employees would be allowed to choose between staying on IPERS in its current form or joining a defined contribution plan, but stated IPERS would not change for current public employees.
The final report included a recommendation to conduct a study on public employee benefits, and stated it recommended preserving “all pension and benefit commitments made to existing employees,” with “any new defined-contribution retirement option should be strictly voluntary for current staff and structured to protect the solvency of the traditional pension system.”
The report also recommended, “where feasible, offer employees a choice among benefit plans. For instance, the option to choose a defined-contribution retirement plan instead of a pension for new hires.”
Reynolds said there is already a legislative committee that is supposed to meet every other year to review public employee benefits, and said the task force’s suggestions would be brought before that group of lawmakers.
Democrats and organizations representing public employees have criticized the suggestion, saying the proposed changes would make IPERS insolvent. Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale, said in a statement Tuesday that “any changes to IPERS and other public pensions would be a devastating blow to Iowa’s workforce and economy.”
“For decades, these pensions have provided a secure retirement for public servants, including teachers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, and social workers, who dedicate their lives to serving our communities,” McBurney said. “Any changes to this system would break yet another promise to workers and further damage Iowa’s already struggling economy, which is ranked dead last in the nation. Instead of the Governor’s DOGE task force threatening retirement security, we should be taking steps to strengthen Iowa’s workers.”
Several GOP legislative leaders and lawmakers have said there is not significant interest in making changes to IPERS in the 2026 legislative session.
One of the other high-profile suggestions was to tie public school teachers’ and administrators’ pay to student achievements. While Lutz had characterized the proposal as a “pay-for-performance system” in August, he later clarified the suggestion would not cut educators’ pay, but would provide incentives like up to 10% of base pay through bonuses for teachers who meet certain student achievement goals.
The final report recommended establishing a “merit-based compensation framework – including a bonus structure, teacher professional development and incentives for those in high-need schools– in order to improve student outcomes and financially reward high-performing teachers.”
The governor said the state Department of Education already awards Teachers Accelerating Learning (TAL) grants to “incentivize teachers that have gone above and beyond,” similar to the task force’s proposal.
Iowa State Education Association President Joshua Brown said in a statement merit-based pay structures for teachers do not result in improved scores for students and schools in the most need of assistance.
“The ‘pay for performance’ recommendation is a tired scheme, for a system repeatedly proven ineffective and harmful,” Brown said. “The metrics used to measure performance are unreliable and often irrelevant. They are biased in favor of high-performing students and proficient test takers and do nothing for students living under circumstances outside their control. We need our government to support our students and education professionals, not devise ‘fixes’ that don’t work.”
Though less contentious than changes to IPERS and teacher pay, Reynolds highlighted DOGE suggestions to make local governments more efficient through sharing resources and services. These suggestions, and finding new avenues to save reduce local government costs, will be taken into account as she plans to craft legislation aimed at lowering property tax costs in 2026.
Reynolds indicated she may suggest a system to provide incentives to local governments to implement new resource sharing methods — but that these incentives would “have to be time-certain.”
“That is a problem — sometimes we incentivize, and they’re supposed to recognize some savings from collaborating and working together and sharing those services, and then I just backfill it with an incentive forever, and so that kind of defeats the purpose,” Reynolds said. “So I do believe there’s a role for that … it just should be, like, a couple years, maybe three years, for them to adjust and get everything settled and really operational, and then that needs to go away.”

(Photo courtesy of Unraveled)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Dodge County Sheriff’s Office in Wisconsin has been sending deputies into Illinois to transport migrants to and from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in suburban Chicago at the center of the Trump administration’s clash with Illinois officials and activists. 
For more than two decades, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal’s Service to hold federal detainees in the county jail. As part of that contract, which budget documents show provided the county with more than $6 million last year, the sheriff’s office regularly holds migrant detainees for ICE and transports federal detainees of all sorts. 
“We house federal inmates/detainees as part of our agreement with the U.S. Marshal Service.  We also transport to and from various facilities as part of our agreement. The federal government reimburses us for transportation. ICE is a rider on the agreement,” Sheriff Dale Schmidt told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email. “It is a simple, non-political arrangement we have had for 20+ years under all previous administrations during this contract (Including President Obama and President Biden).” 
But critics say that this year the arrangement has become more political because of President Donald Trump’s increased immigration enforcement and ICE’s escalation of tactics in both its efforts to capture people without legal documentation, and its confrontations with protesters.
“For two decades or more, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office has obtained a steady stream of revenue from ICE for transporting and jailing persons in immigration detention,” Tim Muth, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin said in an emailed statement. “That practice continues. We regret that the sheriff declines to terminate his contract with ICE, a rogue federal agency that is increasingly violating the rights of persons it seizes from our communities, racially profiling and separating families, and landing some of them in the jail which the sheriff operates.”
Advocates and attorneys for immigrants say that ICE has been frequently moving detainees between detention centers as part of a “shell game” in an effort to keep them hidden from their lawyers and family. 
“I don’t even know where to begin,” said immigration attorney Marc Thompson, describing unprecedented difficulties he’s experienced attempting to locate and represent clients under the second Trump administration. Under previous administrations, Thompson said, clients were relatively easy to locate and communicate with, and the attorney felt he had a good relationship with staff at facilities like the Dodge County Jail. 
Now in nearly 70% of cases, Thompson told the Wisconsin Examiner, clients are “being shipped off to different facilities in many different locations…I’ve had clients sent to Indiana, Louisiana, Texas, Ohio, all different locations.” 
In one case, coordinating a telephone conference with a client who’d been detained in a private out-of-state facility required a three day set-up process for a video call with poor audio quality that lasted just 20 minutes, Thompson said. 
Another change he’s seen is that detainees in Wisconsin who are taken to Dodge County are given court dates in Chicago. 
“I had it where I’ve traveled to Dodge County after checking to see if my client’s there, only to drive all the way there to find out that that morning they were moved to a different facility,” said Thompson. 
The Broadview ICE detention center in a suburb of Chicago has drawn regular protests for months. The presence of Dodge County Sheriff’s deputies at the Broadview facility were first reported by the independent media outlet Unraveled.

The federal response to those protests has frequently escalated into violence and those escalations have been used as justification for Trump’s attempt to deploy troops from the Texas National Guard to the Chicago area. 
Illinois state laws restrict ICE cooperation with local law enforcement and prevent the long term detention of migrants in Illinois. Because of that prohibition, ICE has moved detainees from Illinois to facilities in nearby Indiana and Wisconsin. 
Schmidt did not respond to questions from the Wisconsin Examiner about how frequently his deputies have driven detainees in and out of Broadview under Trump, but the department’s 2024 annual report shows sheriff’s office personnel made 302 trips at the request of ICE last year. 
Dodge County is reimbursed for its trips to Illinois. The journey from Juneau to Broadview is a five-hour round trip. State Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove), whose district covers part of Dodge County, says expending county resources to help ICE doesn’t keep the community safe and amounts to participating in the administration’s “cruelty.” 
“Local law enforcement does not have to take on federal immigration enforcement duties. When they do, it risks discouraging victims and witnesses from coming forward — making all of us less safe,” Ratcliff said in a statement. “Our local resources should not be diverted from protecting our local communities. Further, there are serious concerns about inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers. There are also troubling political shell games being played in which detainees are transferred from facility to facility — sometimes across state lines — making it difficult for attorneys and families to locate them or ensure they receive due process. That is not justice; that is cruelty disguised as policy and it’s unconstitutional. Wisconsin’s strength lies in our welcoming communities and our commitment to fairness, dignity, and safety for all. I urge our local leaders to prioritize community trust, transparency, and compassion in every action they take.”
“You used to be able to call Dodge, set something up for the next day, spend two-three hours talking,” Thompson said.  “Now I have to fight and find out where they are, try to schedule a time to speak with them. And the family is sitting on pins and needles. They have no idea where their loved one is. They have no idea what’s going on. I’m spending all my time not trying to analyze their case, but simply to find out where they are and try to arrange a time to chat with them. It’s horrible.””
Under the current administration, critics say, transporting ICE detainees is direct participation in an effort to deny due process and avoid transparency. 
“I think there’s a concerning pattern of more local law enforcement being brought in to play an immigration enforcement role as part of the machinery of mass deportations,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. Local departments are paid to transport immigrants for ICE, “as in Dodge most recently, in Brown County as well and Sauk,” she said, and also receive significant federal money for sharing information on immigrants in their custody through 287g agreements.
Neumann-Ortiz pointed to the 287g agreement sought by the Palmyra Police Department, which is still pending. The 287g program involves local law enforcement agreeing to aid ICE in arresting undocumented migrants or holding them in jail until ICE can pick them up.
“There’s real concern about it,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “They’re really trading off public safety and building trust in a diverse community to take this money. That is particularly alarming when you see what’s happening with ICE, and Customs, and Border Patrol and how they’re operating…They are operating as a militarized operation with masks, with guns, and they are profiling people and physically assaulting people violently, and really trampling over people’s due process rights.” 
“Under that threat which is terrorizing communities,” she added, “why in the world would local law enforcement want to partner with that?”

Patrick Dillon didn’t initially see college in his future, but with access to Dual Enrollment and Early
College and support from VSAC’s GEAR UP, he found direction. Now a full-time student at VTSU, Patrick
is pursuing a psychology degree while balancing school, work, and time with family and friends.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  From uncertain to deter[...]","Patrick Dillon didn’t always picture himself going on to college after he graduated from Fair Haven Union High School. Even when he enrolled in Dual Enrollment his junior year, then signed up for Early College his senior year, he figured he was getting a few college credits under his belt “just in case”—but he probably wouldn’t go any further, he thought. 
Dual Enrollment and Early College give eligible high school students the opportunity to complete high school and college requirements simultaneously, saving time and money while easing the transition to higher education. Nobody in Patrick’s family had ever gone to college before, but with the Castleton campus of VTSU so accessible, it was easy to take a few classes while he was still in high school. 
Despite his initial indifference about continuing to college after high school, Patrick’s perspective began to shift when he stepped into his Early College classes at the Castleton campus of Vermont State University (VTSU). The campus felt different than he expected—more personal, with details that made him feel acknowledged. “I ended up really liking it,” Patrick says. “One teacher I had really stuck out to me—Pat Brougham. I’ve taken three classes with her so far. She always knew who each student was.” Another professor, Heather Porter, also made an impression. “She really worked with me to make sure I understood what I was learning. She was very kind.”
Today, Patrick is in his first year as a full-time student at VTSU, pursuing a degree in psychology after an initial interest in criminal justice. He’s on track to graduate in 2028—in just three years thanks to those Dual Enrollment and Early College credits—and hopes to become a school psychologist, specializing in counseling. “The last four years I’ve worked at a summer camp with kids,” he explains, through his summer job at the Fair Haven recreation program. “And I want to work with kids in the future. The whole of the experiences I’ve had with them inspires me.”
Patrick is the first in his family to go to college
In middle school Patrick had connected with Tia Stillman, an Outreach Counselor with VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program. Fast forward a few years and Patrick’s time with GEAR UP turned more tactical. “I would meet with Tia at VTSU or at Fair Haven, wherever I had classes, and she would help me look through the scholarships to figure out what I could apply for.”
In his junior year, Rachel Casey stepped into the role of Patrick’s VSAC Outreach Counselor. As Patrick started thinking more seriously about college, Rachel started meeting with his parents too. “The college stuff didn’t make sense to them, so Rachel helped me and my parents understand it.” 
Those meetings became a regular part of his weeks and months in his senior year. “Rachel helped me apply for everything I could. She really got it,” he says. Together, they completed his FAFSA federal financial aid application, applied for the Vermont Grant, and searched for scholarships he might be eligible for. “I don’t quite qualify for much financial aid, but at the same time, we can’t really afford to pay for college,” he explains. “If I wanted to go, I knew I had to pay for it.” Rachel walked him through loan options as well. “Rachel’s explanations of how everything worked were so helpful. My parents and I had so many questions,” he says.
VTSU Castleton was the right fit
Patrick applied to several colleges around New England. His decision-making process was methodical: he applied, reviewed each financial aid package with Rachel, and compared scholarships and costs. 
Ultimately, his financial aid package, coupled with VTSU’s size and sense of community, won him over. “I like the small school. It feels like a family,” Patrick says. “Classes are small and people are friendly. I have a good friend group.”
“In my mind, there was always a home for me at Castleton,” he says. “I knew I wanted to be in New England. And after I looked around, I just kept coming back home.”
From success on student council to studying psychology
In high school, Patrick was deeply involved in student council all four years. “I made my voice heard,” he says. He was elected class treasurer his first year and was involved in planning student activities and fundraisers. Junior year stands out as a core memory: “Two friends and I ran all of the events during homecoming week. It was really fun.”
At first, Patrick imagined himself pursuing criminal justice or even becoming a high school teacher. But as his interests developed, psychology stood out as both a meaningful and practical option. “I liked it more, and I thought the job prospects might be bigger,” he says. His goal now is to become a school psychologist, working with young people like those he’s mentored in his summer camp counselor job.
Balancing college, work, and time with friends and family
Patrick has worked at Dunkin’ Donuts in Fair Haven for three years and clocks about 30 hours a week. After living off campus, he moved into the Castleton residence halls for the first time this autumn. Balancing work and classes isn’t always easy, but Patrick says he’s strategic. If he can finish his undergraduate degree in three years like he plans to, he notes, he can move directly into a master’s degree program—ideally with employer support. 
Patrick spends his downtime with friends, family, and his two golden retrievers, Hudson and Fisher. On campus, he’s finding his rhythm, surrounded by a community that feels familiar but offers new opportunities. He’s looking forward to getting more involved—possibly even traveling—and is already charting a clear path toward his goal of becoming a school psychologist.
GEAR UP had a huge impact
Looking back, Patrick is crystal clear on the impact of VSAC’s GEAR UP program. “I think I would have been lost without Tia and Rachel to help me out,” he says. “I think if I didn’t have VSAC, I honestly wouldn’t have gone to school.”
But he did. And now, at VTSU, Patrick is determined to make every moment count as he works toward his goals.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A former Utah Senate president who most recently spent more than four years as one of the top leaders of the state’s homelessness system is expected to step down by the end of the year. 
The governor’s office announced in a news release Tuesday that Wayne Niederhauser will retire on Dec. 5. 
“With more than 12 years in the Utah Senate, including six as Senate President, and nearly five as state homeless coordinator, Niederhauser has made a lasting contribution to Utah,” the release said, crediting Niederhauser with strengthening “statewide coordination and accountability in Utah’s homeless system.” 
The announcement comes at a key time for Utah’s homeless system — which is currently under pressure from top Republican legislative leaders and Gov. Spencer Cox to undergo a “sea change” away from “Housing First” strategies and toward more of a focus on substance abuse treatment, accountability, and potentially more civil commitment, or court-ordered mental health treatment. 
‘Compassion that kills’: Gov. Cox says ‘sea change’ in Utah’s homeless system is coming

Niederhauser’s departure means he’ll be leaving unfinished a major project that he’s been working on — the creation of a 1,300-bed homeless campus that he and other state homeless leaders decided to put in northwest Salt Lake City. 
Whether that campus gets built or operationally funded largely hinges on whether the office Niederhauser has led over the past four years, the Utah Office of Homeless Services, will be able to obtain enough funding during the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session scheduled to begin in January. 
State leaders including Gov. Spencer Cox, who first appointed Niederhauser to the homeless coordinator position in 2021, have lauded Niederhauser as an influential and trusted negotiator, saying his relationships with legislators have been key to not only transform Utah’s homeless system but also lobby for funding. 
Asked whether Niederhauser’s departure could jeopardize the homeless campus’ future progress or other key homelessness funding, a spokesperson for the Utah Homeless Services Office said Niederhauser’s interim replacement, Assistant State Homeless Coordinator Nick Coleman, will carry on his work. 
“The proposed homeless services campus remains a top priority for state leaders and the Utah Homeless Services Board,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Interim Coordinator Nick Coleman will continue to collaborate with legislative and local leaders to develop plans and secure funding.”

During his time as state homeless coordinator, Niederhauser helped establish the Utah Office of Homeless Services, and he led the publication of the state’s first-ever plan to address homelessness. He also secured record state funding for homelessness and housing initiatives and helped coordinate years of emergency winter homeless beds, “securing multi-county funding to support shelter operations at the most critical times of the year,” the governor’s office said in the news release. 
“Niederhauser pioneered innovative approaches to address homelessness in Utah,” the office continued. “He piloted non-congregate pod shelters, which have directly helped Utahns transition out of homelessness, and advanced planning and funding to secure land for a new transformative homeless services campus.”
Cox, in a prepared statement, thanked Niederhauser for “his exemplary public service.” 
“Wayne met hard problems with solid leadership and a focus on people,” the governor said. “He built partnerships, plans, and tools that now anchor Utah’s response to homelessness. I’m grateful for his years of service and for the steady foundation he leaves for the next coordinator.”
Niederhauser said he was “proud of what we accomplished. Thank you to the teams and partners who show up every day.” 
“This work is about helping people move forward with dignity, stability, and a real next step,” Niederhauser said.
Cox has appointed Coleman to serve as interim homeless coordinator after Niederhauser retires on Dec. 5, and while state leaders search for a permanent replacement. 
In the meantime, “durable systems established during Niederhauser’s tenure will guide the interim coordinator during the transition,” the governor’s office said.

Barker, shown in this image from Jan. 22, 2025, also says the state should repeal a law requiring the name of a candidate's campaign treasurer to appear on political advertising. (Photo by Grace Hills/ Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas secretary of state’s office recommends streamlining the processing of campaign finance records, lobbying reports and statements of substantial interest by filing those documents directly with the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission.
State law has mandated Secretary of State Scott Schwab operate the state government’s intake center for these documents, but his office does almost nothing with the records before transferring each to the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission. This system persists despite statutes placing responsibility for regulation, oversight and imposition of penalties exclusively with the commission.
Clay Barker, general counsel to the secretary of state’s office, asked the Kansas Legislature’s interim committee on campaign finance to accept this duplicated approach no longer made sense, given widespread access to the internet.
“In today’s world, there’s no need for the secretary of state to be the middleman. We’re just there. We just suck up time and money taking the reports and passing them on,” Barker said.
Both the secretary of state and the disclosure commission offices separately publish online the content of campaign finance reports for candidates, parties and political action committees.
Barker recommended all campaign finance reports in Kansas be filed directly with the disclosure commission. All should be submitted electronically, he said, with limited exceptions for use of paper. State law currently compels candidates for statewide office, such as governor or attorney general, to submit records by computer. Other candidates have an option of paper or electronic reporting.
He said paper filings were inefficient because countless staff hours were consumed by state employees entering contents of documents into a database for analysis. Scans of original documents weren’t easily deciphered, he said.
“It’s very hard for the public sometimes to read or search handwritten campaign finance reports,” Barker said.
Barker also recommended the Legislature repeal a state law requiring candidates to include on advertising the name of the campaign’s treasurer.
“It is a disincentive for a volunteer treasurer to have their name on every mailer whose message, especially negative messaging, they had no role in creating,” Barker said.
Another change suggested by the secretary of state’s office would repeal a requirement candidates, political parties and PACs report expenditures by subcontractors engaged in advertising, public relations or consulting on campaigns. The law requiring reporting on payments to contractors as well as subcontractors was difficult to comply with and hard to enforce, he said.
Rep. Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka, said the challenge of extracting information about subcontractors shouldn’t deter the state from seeking information about the name, amount, date and purpose of payments.
“I’m kind of concerned we’d do this just because people don’t follow the law,” Simmons said. “We’re here for transparency. I worked on campaigns professionally for years. People go out of their way to try and hide things, and I don’t know why we would enable that.”
Barker said the law posed a disproportionate reporting burden on campaigns and committees because the information was frequently beyond their reach. Often, he said, consulting firms bundled services for clients through complex networks of subcontractors. The inability of candidates to verify activities of subcontractors risked the filing of incomplete or inaccurate reports, he said.
“I do everything I can to follow the law and be transparent as I know other legislators do,” said Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker. “I don’t see an issue with this either way.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Clay-Barker-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-21 16:01:35.403054

(photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state panel on Tuesday voted to keep lawmakers’ base pay the same, but left the door cracked to reconsider that decision next month.
The Legislative Compensation Board voted to keep legislators’ base pay at $47,500 a year, but member James Leewright, a former Republican senator appointed by the state House, said he wants to revisit the decision when the board meets again Nov. 4.
Leewright said some members were just recently appointed to the panel and learned new information.
But some members objected to reconsidering legislative pay so soon, saying they just voted to reject a salary increase.
“This board can’t continue to meet every time someone wants to change a prior vote,” said Robert P. DeNegri, who was appointed by the governor.
“It’s obvious to me what is happening here,” he said. “There’s certain members of the board that don’t like the results of the vote and they want to reconvene this board to vote again.”
David “Chip” Carter, a gubernatorial appointee, said he has never been a member of a board that was not allowed to revisit its decisions.
Maria Maule, the board’s attorney, said she would advise against revisiting the vote.
“I think it makes it really confusing to people if you are continually revisiting the same issue,” she said.
After the meeting, Chairman Brian Jackson, another gubernatorial appointee, said he did not know if a second vote on legislative salaries would be taken in November.
Total compensation for Oklahoma lawmakers is $72,869, a figure which includes the base salary for those not in leadership, per diem payments during session, benefits and state retirement contributions, according to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services.
The compensation board, which meets every two years in odd numbered years, did approve an increase in stipends for some who serve legislative leadership positions. They receive a stipend on top of their base pay.
The House Speaker and Senate Pro Tem stipend will increase by nearly 26% — from $18,829 to $23,750.
Some other leaders will see their stipends increase nearly 21% to $15,675. Those leaders would receive a $2,693 hike.
Leewright attempted to add additional leadership posts to the stipend increase, but was advised it would be a violation of the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act because the posts were not listed on the agenda.
The panel could revisit the issue at its November meeting.
An analysis by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services indicates that Oklahoma legislative salaries and per diem are the second highest among surrounding states at $60,828.
Colorado was the highest at $63,914 while New Mexico was the lowest at $14,820. New Mexico does not provide a salary to lawmakers.
Oklahoma lawmakers are in session from February until the last Friday in May, but can be called into special session. They normally meet Monday through Thursday.
Lawmakers who live more than 50 miles away from the Capitol also earn a per diem of $196 a day.
Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, issued a statement encouraging the panel to revisit the legislative pay decision.
“The job of a lawmaker takes substantial time away from families and other career obligations outside of the Capitol,” he said.
Many say it is a full-time job because they are meeting with constituents and performing other legislative functions when they are not in session.
Any changes would be effective Nov. 18, 2026, after the next legislative general election.
The panel in 2019 voted to increase legislative pay to $47,500 from $35,021. Two years earlier, it voted to decrease legislative pay.

(Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democrat Abigail Spanberger holds a 7-point lead over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s 2025 governor’s race, according to a new Commonwealth Poll released Tuesday by the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University.
The survey, conducted Oct. 6-14, shows Spanberger leading Earle-Sears 49% to 42% among registered voters — down from a 9-point margin reported in the school’s September poll conducted in August. Spanberger also holds an 11-point advantage among independent voters, 35% to 24%, though 20% remain undecided.
The poll, which offers a snapshot of voter sentiment heading into the final stretch before the Nov. 4 election, found that all three statewide races have tightened since late summer.
In the lieutenant governor’s contest, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, leads Republican nominee John Reid 44% to 43%, a slimmer margin than her 4-point advantage in the previous Commonwealth Poll. 
Meanwhile, Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares now holds a 45% to 42% lead over former Democrat Jay Jones — marking a 9-point net swing since the last survey. 
The new poll was conducted after revelations surfaced of violent text messages sent in 2022 by Jones in which he talked about “two bullets to the head” for a former Republican House speaker and the death of the speaker’s children. The controversy has drawn bipartisan attention and reshaped the AG race. 
“The race for lieutenant governor shows John Reid within 1 percentage point of Ghazala Hashmi (Hashmi 44% to Reid 43%),” said former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who founded the VCU school that conducts the poll. 
“The attorney general’s race shows Jason Miyares moving into the lead over Jay Jones (Miyares 45% to Jones 42%). These results highlight that, with several weeks to go before the election, voters are paying attention to what the candidates are doing — and what they have done — as a precursor to what they will do if elected,” Wilder wrote.
Wilder noted that the race for governor remains relatively stable compared to the others but said Democrats’ narrowing advantage underscores the volatility of Virginia’s electorate in statewide races. 
“Our school’s poll results reflect little change in the race for governor, though the lead for Democrats has narrowed (Spanberger 49% to Earle-Sears 42%),” he said.
The survey also asked voters which issues would most influence their decisions in the upcoming election. The rising cost of living topped the list, cited by 27% of respondents — reinforcing economic pressures as the dominant theme of the race.
Immigration ranked second at 14%, followed by women’s reproductive rights at 12%, marking a reversal from the previous poll, when reproductive rights placed ahead of immigration.
The shift suggests that while inflation continues to dominate public concern, debates over border policy and abortion access are also shaping voter motivation in the final weeks of the races. 
The poll also measured voter sentiment on which party should control the House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are up for grabs this fall.
Among registered voters, 47% said they want Democrats to hold a majority, while 44% prefer Republican control. Independent voters remain largely undecided — with 28% favoring a Democratic majority, 23% preferring Republicans and nearly half expressing no opinion.
Those figures mirror the narrow statewide dynamics reflected in the gubernatorial and down-ballot races, where neither party has a commanding lead heading into November.
The poll was conducted via phone interviews with 842 adult Virginians, with a 3.95 percentage point margin of error.

Dan McKee’s administration announced the first wave of housing development programs funded by the $120 million bond approved by Rhode Island voters in November 2024. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Nearly a year after Rhode Island voters overwhelmingly approved the largest housing bond in state history, applications are now open for communities and developers looking to access these funds.
Gov. Dan McKee’s administration on Tuesday announced programs that make up the first wave of proceeds funded by the $120 million bond approved by more than two-thirds of Rhode Island voters in November 2024. 
The first wave will make available $81 million, consisting of $9 million toward infrastructure and engineering costs, $66 million for programs administered by RIHousing, and $6 million to repair homes.
“These bond investments we are announcing today are crucial levers to support our continued economic development,” McKee said at a State House press conference.
The Housing Infrastructure Program provides up to $8 million for municipalities and developers to offset the cost of essential infrastructure such as water and sewer connections — a common complaint local leaders have when large-scale projects have been proposed in their towns. The deadline for applications is Nov. 28, the day after Thanksgiving.
The other program, Municipal Infrastructure Design Initiative FY26,  offers up to $1 million to help municipalities with architectural and engineering. The application deadline is Dec. 5.
“Municipalities cannot shift already tight local budgets to upgrade water mains, expand sewer capacity, or replace storm drains to support hundreds of new housing units,” Randy Rossi, executive director of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, told reporters.
On Thursday, the McKee administration will open up an additional $66 million in bond money  — along with other state and federal funds — that will be administered through five different programs by RIHousing, the quasi-governmental agency that finances affordable home construction across the state.
That money includes:

Up to $12 million to support a new set-aside for the development of small-scale permanent supportive housing with wraparound services for households needing additional support to maintain stable housing. 


Up to $12 million toward rental developments running from five to 30 units


Up to $27 million to extend a flexible funding program focused on supporting the production of new affordable rental developments


$5 million toward preserving and rehabilitating existing affordable homes. An additional $5 million will come from the RIHousing Affordable Trust.


$10 million to redevelop foreclosed, blighted, or vacant properties

On Nov. 15, the McKee administration will open applications for a $6 million statewide home repair program run by the Providence Revolving Fund. Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard said many voucher holders struggle to find apartments because small landlords often can’t afford to bring their units up to federal standards.
“We are confident these set-asides will open up new opportunities for housing production,” Goddard told reporters. “Collectively, these programs, totaling $81 million will create and preserve thousands of homes.”
A second wave of programs for the remaining $39 million from the bond issue will launch in the “coming months,” McKee said. That will include $10 million set aside for public development, meaning the state will be responsible for building new housing on land that it already owns.
It’s an idea that Goddard hasn’t been fully sold on in the past, previously telling Rhode Island Current she’s “not clear on the value of the public entity taking on development risk.” 
Instead, the plan is to partner with housing authorities at the local level, she affirmed in an interview Tuesday.
Additionally, the state’s Executive Office of Housing plans to allocate $5 million in bond money toward providing nonprofits a line of credit in order to acquire sites they’ve identified for new affordable homes.
“They often don’t have the deep pockets to compete with others,” Goddard told Rhode Island Current. “If they see something they want to put a down payment on, they don’t have to come to me or RIHousing for a vote or anything.”
This program still needs an administrator, which the state on Tuesday began the search for through a request for proposals. Submissions are due Nov. 19, 2025.

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)Black Floridians are worried about their economic futures and stressed about the direction of the country, according to a comprehensive survey done this summer by a group that has researched Black attitudes over the past decade.
In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda questioned more than 500 Black adults in Florida over several weeks and discovered that many of those who answered had insecurity about their finances.
The survey found that 45% said they had less than $500 in savings, while 43% said they don’t have enough money to pay for food and housing. Many of those who responded had a pessimistic view of what lies ahead. 
These findings come as affordability continues to be a major issue ahead of the 2026 elections. Florida Republicans say they plan to push ahead with ways to cut property taxes, while Democrats argue that steps should be taken to address years of property insurance hikes. Health insurance premiums for plans purchased on the federal healthcare exchange are expected to spike unless Congress steps in and restores Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.
Up, up, and away: 2026 health insurance premiums set to double for millions of Floridians

Meanwhile, 76% of respondents said they fear the cost of living will go up under President Donald Trump, while 66% agreed that Black people will lose their rights and endure more racial discrimination.
But the survey did find that a large segment of younger Black men — a component that may have helped Trump make inroads with minorities in the 2024 election — retain a positive outlook because Trump won. Fifty percent of Black men between the ages of 18 and 44 said they felt positively about Trump’s election and 44%  said they will feel safer and secure under his presidency.
The survey also asked questions about policy including abortion; 69% of those who responded said abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
In terms of health care, 58% said they or a family member has had Medicaid coverage at some point in their lives. And of those who have been on Medicaid, 93% said the safety-net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled is important to them or their families, including 72% who said it’s been “very important.”
Despite the importance of Medicaid, 32% of the respondents report having had trouble finding a Medicaid-participating provider to care for them.
More than half of the Black women aged 18-44 surveyed (54%) said they want more children but just 29% plan to have them. Those respondents reported rising food, housing, health care. and childcare prices as reasons why.
Mental health is of concern to Black Floridians, the survey shows, particularly among young females. Sixty-six percent of Black women aged 18-44 said they worried about their mental health at least once a week, compared to 57% of men the same age. Forty-two percent of women aged 45 and older said they worry about their mental health at least once a week, compared to 48% of men.
The poll, The Lives and Voices of Black Adults Across 10 States, also explores how Black communities in nine other states are responding to Trump administration.Conducted in partnership with public opinion research firm PerryUndem, the poll surveyed more than 5,000 Black people in Florida, California, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey,  North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia
“It is not surprising that the major issues impacting Black families in 2025 are directly related to economic security and health care. Our communities already face significant barriers to accessing true Reproductive Justice due to centuries of systemic racism — from deeply rooted inequities within our healthcare system, to a severe lack of representation across industries,” said Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.
“Our new poll demonstrates that these issues have only been further exacerbated by the Trump administration’s all-out assault on our civil rights, with Black communities bearing the brunt of his attacks. The results speak for themselves, and should signal an urgent call to action for state and federal lawmakers to utilize our 2025 Black Reproductive Justice Policy Agenda as a roadmap for the policy solutions necessary in order for Black women, girls and gender-expansive people to thrive.”

July 19, 2022. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.Ten Tribal Nations in Michigan have filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court urging them to reject an attempt by Canadian oil pipeline company Enbridge Energy to have a federal court settle a lawsuit first brought by Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019, asking instead to have the case remain in state court. 
“For many years, Tribal Amici have called on the State to uphold its public-trust obligation to protect the Straits of Mackinac and the Great Lakes, including the fisheries, from these known dangers of the aging Straits Pipelines,” the Tribal Nations wrote in their brief. “Michigan’s suit against Enbridge is a long-overdue course correction.”
A request for comment was made to Enbridge, but has yet to be returned.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The brief cites the leak of a different pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 6B, into the Kalamazoo River in 2010, and the environmental harms that resulted from that. 
Nessel is seeking to close the pair of pipelines that run through the Straits of Mackinac as the pipes were aging, looking to prevent a leak that could substantially contaminate the Great Lakes. While the suit was initially filed in state court, it has bounced between state and federal court in a question of who has jurisdiction. 
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals last year sent the case back to state court, which was a win for Nessel, but in June, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to take up the case on an appeal from Enbridge. While the case had been in the federal appellate court, 63 tribal nations — again led by the Bay Mills Indian Community — filed a similar brief seeking to have the case return to state court. 
The decision from the Sixth Circuit came down to a 30-day deadline to request the case move to federal court, which the court determined Enbridge missed. The Supreme Court took up the case in June, and will decide whether Enbridge should be granted an exemption to that 30-day deadline.

“No part of Section 1446 allows a defendant to escape the 30-day deadline by asserting that it only recently discovered that a federal court might be more sympathetic to its arguments,” the amicus brief reads. “But at bottom, that is Enbridge’s explanation for what it attempted here.”
“Enbridge missed a court deadline by more than two years, without excuse, and now they want to change the rules,” Caroline Flynn, a lawyer at Earthjustice who is representing the Tribes, added in a press release. “The Supreme Court should see through Enbridge’s transparent attempt at gamesmanship.”
The Tribal Nations also argued that federal courts should not “encroach” on state court jurisdictions.
“If it were not for Enbridge’s procedural gamesmanship, the merits of this state public-trust dispute may well have been settled long ago — and the risks to Tribal Amici’s critical treaty-protected resources addressed,” the brief continues. 
The Tribal Nations that joined the amicus brief are Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Hannahville Indian Community, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi Tribe (NHBP), Pokagon Band of Potawatomi, and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.
“The continued operation of Line 5 puts my Tribal Nation in grave danger,” said Whitney Gravelle, President of the Bay Mills Indian Community, in the press release accompanying the brief.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)A Florida Republican filed a bill Tuesday that would fine law enforcement agencies for not partnering with ICE and allowing families whose loved ones were killed by a noncitizen to sue certain local governments.
HB 229, filed by Seminole state Rep. Berny Jacques, would use the new $10,000 fine for out-of-compliance law enforcement to compensate the aggrieved families. It’s the largest proposed change so far to Florida immigration laws ahead of the 2026 session.
“Florida stands against lawlessness,” Jacques — who’s also sponsoring legislation to require all employers to verify new hires’ immigration status — said in a press release. “We will stand with law-abiding citizens first and ensure that those who break our laws are held accountable.”
The four-page bill builds off a sweeping law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in February. That law, which removed in-state tuition for undocumented college students and created state-level immigration crimes, requires county law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in so-called 287(g) agreements.
Although cities are not required to enter into these agreements, the state has argued that they can’t purposely cancel the partnerships once they’ve been enacted. This would constitute active defiance of Florida’s mandate that cities use their “best efforts” to combat illegal immigration, Florida officials say.
HB 229 provides new penalties for noncompliance. Law enforcement agencies refusing to work with ICE would be fined $10,000 by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FDLE would use that money to compensate families whose loved ones were killed by noncitizens, as long as the crime was committed on or after July 1, 2026, and the family fills out a form with FDLE.
Similarly, these families would be able to sue out-of-compliance police or a local government if it has a sanctuary policy protecting undocumented immigrants — although these are already illegal in Florida — and if its negligence paved the way for the Floridian’s death.
Jacques’ bill is named the “Shane Jones Act” after a man who was killed in a traffic accident by an immigrant illegally in the country. He left behind two children and his wife, Nikki Jones, has since appeared alongside DeSantis in press events to call for stronger state-level immigration laws.
“For too long, American families have been left to pick up the pieces after their loved ones were taken from them by crimes that could have been prevented,” Jones said in Jacques’ press release. “The Shane Jones Act represents a turning point — finally holding local governments accountable when they fail to enforce immigration laws.”
Other immigration-related bills filed ahead of the 2026 legislative session include Jacques’ bill expanding the E-Verify system to all private employers, and Sen. Don Gaetz’s bill to prevent undocumented immigrants from driving commercial vehicles.

Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday appointed West Fargo School District Business Manager Levi Bachmeier to be North Dakota’s next state superintendent of public instruction.
Bachmeier will begin the position after outgoing Superintendent Kirsten Baesler is sworn in as an assistant secretary with the U.S. Department of Education.
Since 2019, Bachmeier has served as business manager of the West Fargo School District, the state’s fastest-growing school district. He was policy director and education policy adviser for Republican Gov. Doug Burgum from 2016-2019. He previously taught high school social studies for two years with Teach for America and spent a summer as a policy analyst fellow with the U.S. Department of Education.
Armstrong credited Bachmeier with supporting innovation and accountability in K-12 schools. 
Bachmeier, a West Fargo native, has a bachelor’s degree in education from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota. He serves on the State Board of Public School Education, the State Board of Career and Technical Education and the State Board of Higher Education. He plans to resign from those boards prior to becoming state superintendent. 
Bachmeier would need the approval of voters during the 2026 election to fulfill the remainder of Baesler’s term, which expires in 2028. Superintendent of public instruction is a nonpartisan post, but candidates typically seek a letter of support from a political party.
The state superintendent supervises elementary and secondary education, including developing course standards and student assessment. The superintendent also is a member of the Board of University and School Lands, which oversees the Common Schools Trust Fund, valued at more than $7.7 billion.
The state superintendent position pays $147,978 per year.
Baesler was confirmed Oct. 7 by the U.S. Senate to serve as assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education in the U.S. Department of Education. However, the federal government shutdown is delaying her start date.

Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, speaks on the Senate floor, Feb, 4, 2025. (LRC Public Information)A Northern Kentucky Republican is renewing his push to limit pardon powers of Kentucky governors around election time. Some of his colleagues agreed with him in a committee hearing on the legislation Tuesday. 
Sen. Chris McDaniels, R-Ryland Heights, told lawmakers on the Interim Joint State Government Committee that the upcoming 2026 legislative session would mark the seventh time he’s filed a bill for a constitutional amendment to limit gubernatorial pardon powers. McDaniels filed the bill earlier this year and it gained passage in the Senate, but stalled in the House. 
McDaniels has been championing such legislation since former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin issued a flurry of pardons to people convicted of crimes including rape, murder and child abuse in 2019 after losing the election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
“What we found in 2019 is the power to pardon is unlimited in the commonwealth of Kentucky, and it rests solely with one person, and that is the governor,” McDaniels said. 
The latest proposal from McDaniels factors in the addition of early voting in Kentucky. He is proposing that from 60 days before a general election for governor through the new governor’s swearing-in, “there would be no power to pardon.” 
“The intent with this is so that either the governor who issued a pardon or his party would have to stand in front of voters and account for any pardons that were issued,” McDaniels told the committee. 
Several Republicans on the committee expressed support for McDaniel’s proposal. If it makes it through the General Assembly next year, Kentucky voters could approve or reject the change to the Constitution in the 2026 November election. 
“Because it still has the constitutional intent, it still gives the governor his powers, it doesn’t take it away, it just makes some common sense on the timing and the change that is needed,” said Sen. Mike Nemes, R-Shepherdsville. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said residents in his district have told him “overwhelmingly they are in favor” of the proposal. 
“I think it is certainly time, and my hope is that we can move this forward this year,” said Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, and chairman of the House’s State Government Committee.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)New Mexico officials this week will share information about forthcoming laws requiring labeling for products that contain so-called “forever chemicals.”
The virtual meeting on Wednesday follows recent proposed rulemaking for both labeling and restricting such products, and comes amid national pushback from industry.
The proposed rules come via House Bill 212—the PFAS Protection Act—passed by lawmakers in the 2025 legislative session. The bill institutes the phasing out of most intentionally added per and poly fluoroalkyl substances— PFAS—from in everyday items.
This class of manmade chemicals, which has thousands of variants, resist breaking down in nature and can accumulate in water, soils and increasingly in the blood and bodies of humans and animals around the world. Because of PFAS’ durability, they’ve been used extensively in materials for waterproofing, nonstick cookware, makeup, carpets and firefighting foams.
Studies on PFAS’ health impacts remain ongoing, but have thus far been linked to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
American Chemical Council, an industry group representing 190 chemical companies, said it opposed the labeling requirements and called the department’s proposed rule “inconsistent” in an Oct. 14 statement to Chemical and Engineering News.
The group plans further participation in rulemaking, officials told Source NM in a statement.
“There are a number of concerns and questions about the scope of the New Mexico proposal, and we’ll be actively engaged in the rulemaking process to advocate that any requirements are based on credible science, do not mislead consumers or users of products, or create overly burdensome requirements that could negatively impact innovation and economic development,” Senior Director of Product Communications Tom Flannigan said.
Secretary James Kenney told Source NM that he expected the department to “face headwinds,” on rulemaking.
“We know that we’re going to face national resistance, and the question that I need New Mexicans to wrestle with –- and to be clear, we’ve wrestled with it — ‘Why are we going to let outside voices from Washington, D.C., telling you what should be on your kitchen table with or without PFAS, with or without your knowledge.”
Carla Hutton, the senior regulatory analyst for Bergeson and Campbell, an international law firm based in Washington, D.C. that often represents chemical industry groups before federal and state regulators, said the labeling requirement issued by New Mexico came as a real “surprise.”
Hutton said the law firm won’t take a position on the rulemaking, but said officials there will be watching it closely to see how it affects industry, including how labeling requirements in other states impact New Mexico’s rulemaking.
“The labeling requirement is a big ask,” she said. “It’s complicated. It’s not as though a single company or factory manufactures all the bits and pieces and puts them together there, so there’s a lot of questions about how companies will have to work through the supply chains and determine what needs to be labeled and how.”
Environmental groups who have supported legislation to limit the sale of products containing PFAS in other states said they’ll be watching New Mexico’s rulemaking. Gretchen Salter, the policy director at Safer States, a nonprofit dedicated to eliminating chemical exposure in the environment, said the concern for PFAS extends over the lifetime of the a product, whether it’s in production, being used or disposed into landfills.
“Consumers have a right to know, and they want to know whether they’ve got PFAS in their products,” Salter said. “And it doesn’t matter the kind of PFAS, because there really is no safe PFAS.”
While the new rulemaking and HB212 aims to prevent new pollution, state officials said they’re still addressing the consequences of contamination from decades of PFAS use on military sites.
To that end, New Mexico environment and health department officials will travel to the Clovis Civic Center on Thursday and present the results of a recent study evaluating blood tests from Curry County residents. The meeting will also be livestreamed here.
While the presence of PFAS in 99% of the Curry County samples is on par with national studies  of PFAS across the nation, New Mexico environment officials previously told Source NM in August, the presence of PFAS used by the U.S. Air Force firefighting foams in people’s blood was a “direct correlation,” to the contamination that migrated off-base.
The report also found that 14 people tested had very high PFAS levels, similar to levels found in other states where the chemicals were manufactured or spilled. For comparison, only an estimated 9% of adults nationwide have those levels present.
According to a news release, the New Mexico Department of Health will offer one-on-one private health consultations, even for non-participants.
The New Mexico Environment Department, will also offer sign-ups for free private drinking water well tests and installation of free PFAS filtration systems if the levels exceed drinking water standards.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-21 19:03:45+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House GOP pitches $700-per-filer middle class income tax cut,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/21/ct-middle-class-income-tax-cut-pitch/,"Instead of spending $500 million to offset federal cuts, CT's GOP leaders asked, why not use the money to cut state income tax burdens?","Minority Republicans in the state House of Representatives challenged Democratic lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday to rethink their approach toward helping middle-class families struggling with Connecticut’s high cost of living and federal budget cuts.
Rather than spending as much as $500 million in state funds to offset federal cuts to nutrition programs, health care and energy assistance, GOP leaders asked, why not cut state income tax burdens by as much as $700 per filer?
“Property taxes driven by revaluation are crushing Connecticut’s middle class, yet our Democratic colleagues ignore this crisis while pushing policies that increase costs,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said.
House and Senate Democratic leaders want to use $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — the second-largest year-end cushion in state history — for a response fund.
 “We believe that is not prudent,” Candelora said, adding that if the surplus won’t be used entirely for its chief purposes — to shrink pension debt and maintain budget reserves — then it should finance relief for the middle class.
The House GOP specifically wants to bolster an existing credit that offsets up to $300 in property tax burdens for an estimated 873,000 taxpayers.
Individuals earning less than $49,500 per year and couples making less than $70,500 receive the full credit, according to state tax rules. Singles earning between $49,500 and $109,500 and couples making between 70,500 and $130,500 are eligible for a partial credit.
The House Republican plan would:

Boost the maximum credit to $1,000;


Boost the annual income eligibility limits to $130,000 for singles and $200,000 for couples;


And guarantee that no eligible filer receives less than $400.

Republicans project this increase would cost the state about $500 million per year.
“Our plan is straightforward: take that same money and put it toward the largest property tax credit expansion in state history,” said Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. “That’s how you help people, not by speculating about what might happen down the road and using fear as an excuse to grab money now.”
Connecticut Democrats, who also have been exploring state tax relief to assist low- and middle-income families that would suffer from federal cutbacks, were non-committal in their response to the GOP proposal.
 “I am pleased to see House Republicans recognize the Trump administration has created a fiscal emergency that must be addressed,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said.
“Gov. Lamont is supportive of policies or ideas that make life more affordable and reduce burdens on middle-class and working families, and that includes through property tax relief while also supporting key social service programs … that have unfortunately been impacted by Republicans in Congress,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said Tuesday.
Lamont signed the largest state income tax cut in state history into law in 2023, a plan that added about $300 annually to many middle-class households’ refunds.
But many Democrats also say tax relief can’t be the only solution, given that several Washington-funded relief programs were stalled by the Oct. 1 federal government shutdown, or from ongoing budget cuts ordered last July by Congress and President Trump.
Many of those ongoing cuts don’t take effect until 2026 or 2027.
But the shutdown triggered by congressional gridlock over the budget debate already has created a host of short-term threats.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — already is out of money. Connecticut, which administers the federal program here, is fronting the $6 million needed monthly to maintain aid to about 52,000 infants, older children and women.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, which provides about $72 million in nutrition assistance to more than 391,000 Connecticut residents monthly, runs out of reserves in early November, according to the Lamont administration.
The same is true for the state’s winter heating assistance program, which is funded chiefly with federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program grants. The Lamont administration projects more than 100,375 households will need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago.
Democrats in the General Assembly say they hope to create a short-term response fund to blunt these shutdown-induced program cuts in special session on Nov. 12-13.
And they also want to scale back aggressive budget caps that have generated huge surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion per year or 8% of the General Fund, since 2017. Those surpluses have been used to build reserves and reduce pension debt.
But Democratic legislative leaders already have begun the process of shifting about $600 million annually from the must-save category back into the General Fund for use in future years to supplant lost federal revenue.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5961-e1603486193718.jpg,,,2025-10-21 15:17:35.496830
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-21 18:55:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Health department layoffs gutted preventive health leadership,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/21/health-department-layoffs-gutted-preventive-health-leadership/,"Terminated directors included those responsible for leading chronic disease prevention, diabetes, cardiovascular health, cancer, school health, tobacco control, injury and violence prevention, heart disease and stroke prevention, and oral health programs, among others.","Abrupt terminations at the Mississippi Department of Health earlier this month removed the directors of about a dozen preventive health programs from their posts, according to staff members who were laid off. 
The layoffs included roughly 20 people in the Offices of Preventive Health and Health Disparities, many of whom were program leaders. Some worked at the health department for nearly two decades. 
Terminated directors included those responsible for leading chronic disease prevention, diabetes, cardiovascular health, cancer, school health, tobacco control, injury and violence prevention, heart disease and stroke prevention, and oral health programs, among others. 
Mississippi has one of the highest rates of preventable diseases in the country, including heart disease, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. These conditions disproportionately affect Black Mississippians, and contribute to the state’s high infant and maternal mortality rates. 
Selma Kelly-Alford is among the agency’s leaders who was fired. The bureau director for language access at the health department, Kelly-Alford was laid off on Oct. 1 after five years working at the agency. 
“We were making a great impact,” she said. “…Not all the work happens in the clinic. You know, in order to educate people, we need to learn how to really target those communities appropriately.”
Staff members were also laid off in the department’s Strategic Planning and Response division, formerly the Office of Emergency Preparedness, amounting to a total of 30 layoffs, said spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
The decision to lay off staff members was made largely due to federal funding reductions, State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said after the Board of Health meeting Oct. 8. 
He also estimated that about 150 contract employees were ordered to stop their work as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown. Non-essential, federally funded contract workers have since been terminated, Flynn told Mississippi Today. 
The reorganization will save the agency about $20 million, Edney said Oct. 8. That figure includes staff layoffs, termination of contract workers and paused federally funded contracts with subgrantees, according to Flynn. 
The changes will not affect the agency’s core public health work or the Women Infants and Children’s (WIC) Nutrition program, Edney said. 
In spite of the federal funding reductions it faces, the health department does not plan to ask for a funding increase from the state Legislature next year. 
Edney said he hopes the staffing changes will result in the agency’s preventive health division providing more direct services to Mississippians on Oct. 8.
“Our programmatic areas should be there to make things better and improve outcomes,” he said. “When I’m not seeing improved outcomes, there will be changes, and I have not seen improved outcomes.” 
The Offices of Preventive Health and Health Disparities host a range of programs to improve the health of Mississippians and address inequalities in the health department’s policies and procedures, according to the health department’s website. 
Programs the offices administer include providing free rides to county health department appointments, training community health workers, educating the public on chronic disease prevention, and providing interpretive services to people with limited proficiency in English receiving agency services. 
Kelly-Alford said she worries the staffing reductions – which removed the employees most familiar with the agency’s preventive health programs – could undermine the initiatives she and others have developed.
“Will it stand?” she said. “Will somebody else come and pick up the pieces?” 
The agency has no concerns about its ability to continue preventive health work, Flynn said. 
The health department provided few language services in 2019 when Kelly-Aford joined as coordinator for the language access program, she said. 
She said she has spent the last five years “building it up, creating the program and really working to make sure that the community was really obtaining those benefits.”
Organizations that receive federal funds are required to provide people with limited English proficiency “meaningful access” to programs and services under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. During her tenure, the division established a language line to provide interpretive services to county health departments, certified about 130 interpreters and implemented a language access plan, she said. 
Today, health department providers use about 20,000 minutes of interpretive services each month to serve patients, she said. Interpreters trained by the health department serve their communities in hospitals, social work settings and schools.  
“We’ve come such a long way,” she said, noting that the agency was not in compliance with Title VI regulations when she began.
Kelly-Alford was not given a reason for her termination on Oct. 1. 
About a week before the layoffs, a report published by the Office of State Auditor Shad White alleged the health department failed to properly monitor $290,000 worth of taxpayer funds directed to the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity.
“The state must stop handing taxpayer dollars to nonprofits with vague goals and then failing to monitor what these nonprofits do with it,” said White in a released statement. “The government is wasting so much money.”
Edney has not named the audit as a reason for the layoffs publicly. But a person outside the department who was briefed on the firings and spoke to Mississippi Today under the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency decisions previously said the downsizing was partially linked to issues outlined in the report. 
Kelly-Alford said her work did not overlap with the grants mentioned in the report. She said it felt important to speak up to avoid being associated with alleged mishandling of federal funds. 
“I’ve worked hard to build my name,” she said. 
At the Oct. 8 press conference, Dr. Edney said the department should do more to eliminate health disparities and improve population health outcomes than simply process federal grants. 
“The area should be doing a better job taking care of people and not just taking care of grants,” he said.
Health department subgrants are not the responsibility of a single person. Several staff members must approve them before they are signed off by Edney, including those cited in the auditor’s report. 
Kelly-Alford said her termination at the health department does not diminish her commitment to providing language access services to Mississippians. She said she is strategizing on how to continue to provide interpreter training to the bilingual community. 
A huge part of public health is preventive health, she said, which includes educating providers and patients about available resources and implementing programs that deliver services to communities.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Four out of five North Carolina families who want their children in afterschool programs can’t access one, according to a new national survey released recently.
The America After 3 p.m. survey, conducted by the Afterschool Alliance, found that about 188,000 North Carolina children currently attend afterschool programs which is roughly the same as five years ago. But an additional 664,000 children would participate if programs were more accessible, the survey found.
Parents cited cost, transportation and a lack of availability as the top barriers to enrollment. More than half said programs were too expensive, nearly half said programs were located too far away or lacked safe transportation, and four in ten said no programs were available in their area. 
“In its new strategic plan, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction calls for North Carolina public schools to be the best in the nation by 2030,” said NC Center for Afterschool Programs Director Elizabeth Anderson. “Given more than 80 percent of North Carolina students’ time is spent learning outside of school, we can’t be the best in the nation without strong afterschool and summer learning programs.”
The survey, based on responses from more than 30,000 families nationwide, including 800 in North Carolina, also found strong bipartisan support for public funding of afterschool programs. Five in six North Carolina parents said they support state funding for afterschool opportunities, including 90% of Democrats and 83% of Republicans. 
Parents whose children attend afterschool programs reported major benefits, with 92% saying the programs help them stay employed or work more hours, and 96% saying they feel less stressed knowing their child is safe and supervised. Three in four parents said afterschool programs make their children more excited about learning and improve school attendance. 
North Carolina is one of 23 states without dedicated state funding for afterschool or summer learning programs. 
Anderson said NC CAP is urging lawmakers to create a dedicated state funding stream for afterschool programs, starting by matching the federal government’s current investment of $35.8 million. 
“Right now in North Carolina, we are able to fund fewer than half of the programs that apply for federal 21st Century Community Learning Center dollars,” she told NC Newsline. “A dedicated state-level funding stream would go a long way toward serving more students through high-quality afterschool.”
She added that the organization is working with national partners on new research, expected next year, to better estimate the cost of serving the 664,000 children still waiting for access to afterschool opportunities.
“Over 664,000 children in North Carolina are waiting for a safe place to learn and grow outside of school,” Anderson said. “It’s time for our state leaders to recognize high-quality afterschool as essential for our children, our families and our economy.”

The seasonal shelter was one of two opened last November after the state wound down its pandemic-era expansion of emergency hotel housing — a move that ultimately displaced 1,400 people.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 16, 2025.

Lamoille Community House, which oversees a shelter in Hyde Park and temporary housing in Morrisville, will take over operations of a family shelter in Waterbury next month.
The Waterbury shelter, located in a former National Guard armory, is specifically meant for families with no stable housing options, and can accommodate anywhere from 12 small families to eight larger families, or a variation depending on the demand.
The Waterbury shelter was opened, along with another shelter in Williston, last November as a seasonal shelter after the state wound down its pandemic-era expansion of emergency hotel housing — a move that ultimately displaced 1,400 people, according to Vermont Public. The shelter had previously been managed by a consulting firm from North Carolina until its closure in June. 
As winter closes in and the shelters prepare to accommodate the homeless, Lamoille Community House director Kim Anetsberger said the Office of Economic Opportunity, which disburses funds to community organizations from the Agency of Human Services, approached her organization to gauge its interest in taking over the shelter.
Good Samaritan Haven, Washington County’s shelter operator, was the office’s first choice, according to Anetsberger, but the organization declined, opting to focus its resources on opening a new shelter in Montpelier, according to The Montpelier Bridge.
“We just want to do our part in making sure that whatever gaps in services and shelter for families are filled while we can,” Anetsberger said. “We just want to make sure that there are options for people and that families aren’t sleeping outside.”

Anetsberger said that Lamoille Community House’s core administrative team is particularly strong at the moment and well-suited for this expansion, and that organization staff and volunteers are familiarizing themselves and connecting with support groups in the Waterbury area. The organization operates an all-season, 21-bed shelter in Hyde Park, which was opened in 2024, along with three family shelter apartments and a recuperative care program in Morrisville.
The Waterbury shelter has a play area for kids, a dining area, a kitchen, laundry and office spaces. Anetsberger is in the process of hiring a new team of full and part-time positions to help staff the the facility.
According to coordinated entry data, there were 4,588 unhoused Vermonters in June, a slight decrease from last year’s count, but a major increase since 2020. In Lamoille as of Oct. 9, there are 36 households at risk of becoming homeless and 46 households that are currently homeless — a total of 118 adults and 64 children, according to the United Way of Lamoille County. That’s a marked drop since August.
The Legislature’s primary contribution to the shelter services landscape was a bill that would have restructured how funding for shelter providers and other organizations is disbursed. It was bill that some, including Anetsberger, opposed. She hopes lawmakers next session will consider allocating more resources to shelter programs, which she said are more cost-effective and efficient, and allow residents greater access to resources than the hotel program did.
“I think people are more successful in shelters than they are in hotels, so I think it would be a really big missed opportunity if, during this legislative session, they didn’t look into putting money towards projects like this. We have a certain amount of money, we need to rehab this building, and that is a possibility through the appropriations in the budget,” Anetsberger said.
A recent analysis by Vermont Public found that the state has invested $789 million of public funds into the state’s housing crisis since a pandemic-era surge in demand, which resulted in just 2,249 new homes, with another 1,156 rehabilitated housing units.
“I know we’ve put a lot of money into it, the state has already, but they have to listen to the people that are doing the work and the experts that have created plan after plan after plan on how to solve this, and listen to that, and really invest and consider creating revenue streams that can be allocated towards housing so that we can really make a bigger impact,” Anetsberger said.

(Screenshot courtesy of governor's office livestream)Stephanie Williams, a music teacher at Mountain View Elementary School in Benton, was announced as the 2026 Arkansas Teacher of the Year at a surprise ceremony Tuesday morning.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the selection alongside state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva in front of the school’s students.
Williams teaches music to Mountain View Elementary’s kindergarteners through fourth graders and was the 2024-2025 Benton School District Teacher of the Year.
She was one of five elementary and middle school teachers announced as semi-finalists in July. In addition to being recognized as one of Arkansas’ best teachers, Sanders and Oliva presented Williams with a $14,000 check sponsored by the Walton Family Foundation.
Williams’ one-year term will begin on July 1, 2026. During that time, she will travel around Arkansas to promote teaching and will serve as a non-voting member on the State Board of Education.
“Behind every successful student is an exceptional teacher who goes above and beyond in the classroom — and this year’s Arkansas Teacher of the Year, Stephanie Williams, is a great example of that ideal,” Sanders said in a press release. “She doesn’t just want her students to succeed; she strives to make learning fun and expand their curiosity, so they never stop growing.”
Williams has been a teacher for 16 years. Like many, Williams got her musical start in sixth grade band as a clarinet player while attending Benton schools, according to the Saline Courier.
She later graduated from Arkansas Tech University with a degree in music education and became a band director at Benton Middle School. She switched to teaching elementary music in 2023 after 14 years teaching band. A press release from the state education department lauded Williams’ lessons integrating science and social studies with music, as well as her “intentional use of music as an intervention tool” to support students.
“It is clear her creativity and ingenuity create an environment where her students thrive,” Oliva said in the press release. “While she teaches music, she weaves in problem-solving skills and concepts that help students build real-world connections. She is proven to be a high-caliber educator and will make a great ambassador for education in our state.”
In addition to her music education degree, she also has a master’s degree in special education from Arkansas State University and has a National Board Certification. She is a member of numerous professional musical education associations, such as the National Association for Music Education and the Arkansas Music Education Association.
“I learn so much from every single one of y’all every single day,” Williams told the gathered students after she was announced as the winner. “Y’all help me become a better teacher every day.”
The Arkansas Teacher of the Year program is part of the National Teacher of the Year program, whose goal is to “recognize and celebrate excellent teachers.” With her selection as Arkansas’ top teacher, Williams is eligible to apply for the national title.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-9.12.12 AM-1024x713.png,,,2025-10-21 15:02:06.753242

Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas. 
State officials have been reluctant to release the total amount in taxes the bankrupt California-based hospital owes. In a filing with the Northern Texas bankruptcy judge earlier this year, Attorney General William Tong’s office cited $67 million in tax liens from December of 2023.
But in multiple proof of claims filed with that same court in July, lawyers for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services said that number has grown to more than $127 million. The documents reveal that Prospect has not met its hospital provider tax obligation, also referred to as a user fee, since 2022.
The records show that Prospect owes $64.4 million in provider taxes for Waterbury Hospital, $47.2 million for Manchester Hospital and $16.2 million for Rockville General Hospital.
The document only calculates the taxes through the end of 2024 and makes no mention of 2025 taxes or whether they have been paid, meaning the bill could be even higher by now.
Spokespeople from Prospect Medical Holdings and MPT did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
As the tax burden owed by Prospect Medical continues to rise, state officials are still negotiating how much of that debt the state will forgive as part of a deal for UConn Health to acquire Waterbury Hospital, said State Comptroller Sean Scanlon.
Scanlon said the state has been negotiating a tax settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings and the hospital’s landlord, Alabama-based Medical Properties Trust, which owns the property and buildings.
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, Gov. Ned Lamont insisted that he didn’t think keeping the hospitals necessitated “taxpayer subsidies.” 
In October 2023, the governor rejected a plea from Yale for $80 million in state funding to help close its $435 million deal with Prospect Medical. That deal eventually fell through, and Yale recently paid Prospect $45 million to end the litigation over the failed deal.
Now, the state seems poised to forgive millions of dollars in unpaid taxes to facilitate the UConn deal.
“The situation has deteriorated over the last year, two years,” Lamont said Tuesday in response to a question about how his thinking regarding taxpayer subsidies has evolved. “We really want to keep these hospitals going. I know how important they are to the community.”
In addition to acquiring Waterbury Hospital, the state is in talks to buy two other private, independent hospitals that are also struggling: Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam.
The state plans to borrow $390 million to fund capital improvement projects at all three hospitals, though it would also support the purchase of Waterbury Hospital, Scanlon said. Funding to acquire Bristol and Day Kimball hospitals would be handled separately, he added.
The money would be bonded through the UConn 2000 program.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said that the tax forgiveness would have to be handled separately by the legislature from the hospital bonding deal.
“If we want to support UConn Health’s taking over the hospital then we will have to [forgive the tax debt] if it’s part of the deal,” Ritter said. “Otherwise you have to consider the alternatives — that the hospital could potentially close or some other private equity firm could come in and buy it.”
The hospital provider tax is intended to help finance the state’s Medicaid program. The revenue generated by the tax is used to receive matching federal funds and to offset other Medicaid costs.
If hospitals are not paying the tax the state’s federal match is less.
A spokesperson for the Connecticut Hospital Association declined to comment for this story.
One of the state’s largest hospital chains is poised to acquire the other two Prospect-owned Connecticut hospitals. Earlier this week a subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare was the successful bidder in bankruptcy court for Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals, with an offer of $86.1 million for the two facilities.
Prospect did not receive any additional bids for the hospitals, court records show. The company originally paid $105 million when it purchased the two facilities in 2016.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-21 15:02:06.753242

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Voting rights advocates and a refugee resettlement agency on Tuesday sued to pause enforcement of Indiana’s recently enacted proof of citizenship efforts, which they allege violate federal voter registration and civil rights laws.
The plaintiffs — League of Women Voters of Indiana, Common Cause Indiana, Hoosier Asian American Power and Exodus Refugee Immigration — also sought information on the Hoosiers affected.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for Indiana’s Southern District. It names Secretary of State Diego Morales as a defendant, along with Indiana Election Division Co-Directors Bradley King and Angela Nussmeyer.
“Since July 1, 2025, Indiana has started to enforce laws that rely on stale, error-ridden data and demand that only certain U.S. citizens produce documentary proof of citizenship to register or to remain registered to vote,” the complaint reads.

It goes on to allege the requirements “risk disenfranchising eligible Hoosier voters” who are naturalized citizens, or who derived citizenship through their parents’ naturalization.
One of the statutes, 2024’s House Enrolled Act 1264, requires designated National Voter Registration Act officials — King and Nussmeyer — to compare the state voter rolls with an Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles database to identify registered voters who hold temporary driver’s licenses or identification cards.
The other, 2025’s House Enrolled Act 1680, applies to those who register to vote with temporary credential numbers.
Under both laws, county election officials send notices to flagged Hoosiers, who have 30 days to provide proof of citizenship. Otherwise, under the first law, they’re stripped from the voter rolls, and under the second, their registration applications are rejected.
The plaintiffs allege the laws violate the NVRA and Civil Rights Act because they discriminate against naturalized and derived citizens. The statutes also demand information that isn’t “equivalent” to federal requirements, they wrote.
The complaint notes that neither federal nor state law requires people who become citizens to update their temporary credentials. The driver’s licenses or ID cards can be valid for up to six years after they’re issued.
That means qualified voters can be flagged, according to the complaint.

The plaintiffs also argued that it can be expensive and take more than 30 days to obtain proof of citizenship, which can include naturalization documentation or verified naturalization number, a U.S. passport, a birth certificate and more.
Getting proof can also require taking time off work to travel long distances and wait long hours — other reasons voters may “giv(e) up,” the plaintiffs wrote.
The organizations complained they’ve had to spend time and money “cleaning up the mess” by educating and helping affected voters.
They seek temporary and permanent injunctions to stop enforcement.
The complaint additionally accuses the defendants of not providing records requested under the NVRA.

So, naturally, the individual champion hails from about 3,700 miles away in Gardabaer, Iceland.
LSU sophomore Gunnlaugur Arni Sveinsson, the world’s No. 11 ranked amateur golfer, shot rounds of 66, 70 and 67 for a 54-hole total of 13-under-par 203 for the victory, one shot better than Alabama’s William Jennings.
Tenth-ranked LSU and No. 17 Alabama tied for the team championship of the 14-team Fallen Oak Collegiate Golf Championship on Monday, but the biggest winner may have been the tournament itself, which continues to grow in stature and popularity in only its third year. The tournament is tri-hosted by Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Southern Miss.
Rick Cleveland
Played over three days amid gloriously sunny and mild autumn weather on one of the most spectacular golf courses anywhere, the tournament drew raves from coaches and players from some of the top teams across the nation. Said Iowa coach Tyler Stith, “I have been coaching college golf for 15 years and this one of the best tournaments I’ve ever been a part of. The tournament operations and hospitality is first-class and the golf course itself is as good as any we play in college golf. This is our third year to play here, and I sure hope we get invited back.”
Ole Miss, the highest-ranked team in the tournament at No. 4 in the country, finished fifth the tournament – an indication of the quality of the competition. Mississippi State finished ninth, three shots ahead of Southern Miss, which finished 11th.
Alabama came from 12 shots behind In the final round to share the team championship with LSU. Both teams finished 32-under par, three shots better than Big 10 golf power Illinois. 
As most college golf tournaments do these days, the tournament had a huge international flavor. Matthew Dodd-Berry, who finished fourth, is from England. Mississippi State’s Ugh Malcor, who tied for 18th, is French. Southern Miss’s Matthew Javier, his team’s medalist at even par, is a member of the Canadian national amateur team and qualified for the Canadian Open on the PGA TOUR this past June.
While disappointed with his team’s fifth-place finish, Ole Miss coach Chris Malloy was thrilled with the success of the Fallen Oak event.
“This has definitely become one of the top four or five regular season golf tournaments in the country,” Malloy said. “Three years ago, we were asking teams to come here. Now, we have a waiting list to get here, including some of the highest-ranked teams in the country. This tournament is only going to get bigger and better.”

2024 NCAA individual champion Michael La Sasso shot 3-under-par for the tournament to finish 18th, a shot behind teammates Tom Fischer and Cameron Tankersley.
Said Malloy, “We just had a really bad second round on Sunday and never could really get it back together to make a run in the final round.”
Mississippi State was led by San Antonio senior Garrett Endicott, who finished 13th individually with a 4-under-par total. The Bulldogs pretty much shot themselves out of the competition with a 6-over par round on Saturday but were 4-under for the last two rounds.
Said State coach Dusty Smith, “We did a great job fighting this week. It wasn’t the start we needed in round one, but I was proud of the resilience we showed.”
Southern Miss coach Eddie Brescher, whose team won two tournaments earlier in the fall, believes his Golden Eagles are capable of qualifying for the NCAA Championship for the first time in school history next spring.
“We’re not that far away,” Brescher said. “We played a quality fall schedule and finished 54-17 against the teams we competed against. We didn’t have our best stuff this weekend, but we showed in the second round what we’re capable of when we finished 5-under-par for the day on one of the hardest courses around. I really, really like my team.”
Walker Wise of Tupelo finished with a 3-over-par total for USM, followed by Mississippi Amateur champion Jake Moffitt, who finished at 5-over despite a final round 76
Southern Miss and Mississippi State have completed their fall seasons, while Ole Miss will compete next week in the East Lake Cup at famed East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The Democratic Party of Arkansas filed a lawsuit against the governor Tuesday seeking an earlier date for the House District 70 special election. 
The HD 70 seat became vacant last month after North Little Rock Republican Rep. Carlton Wing resigned to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS. On Oct. 10, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders scheduled special primary and general elections for March 3 and June 9, 2026, respectively, to select a new representative for the district, which includes portions of Pulaski County. 
The dates are the same as the Senate District 26 special election, which is being challenged in a separate lawsuit. A Pulaski County circuit judge who held a hearing in that case last week said she would rule quickly.
“Following conversations with election officials, the Governor decided that lining up the District 70 special election with the District 26 special election is just common sense, saves taxpayer dollars, and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure,” the governor’s spokesperson, Sam Dubke, said in a Tuesday email.
Sanders calls special election for vacant Arkansas House seat to be held in June

Arkansas Democrats and four other plaintiffs argued in their petition, filed Tuesday in Pulaski County Circuit Court, that the election timeline leaves District 70 voters without representation during the legislative fiscal session that begins on April 8, 2026. They asked the court to direct Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to schedule the special election on March 3.
“Refusing to fill this seat, violating state statute and leaving those Arkansans without representation is simply wrong,” retired Col. Marcus Jones, the chair of the state Democratic Party, said at a press conference Tuesday in front of the Pulaski County Courthouse. “This suit is how we hold the governor and secretary of state accountable to the 30,000 Arkansans that live in House District 70.” 
The lawsuit says the proclamation issued by Sanders setting the special election dates “is unlawful, exceeds her constitutional and statutory powers, and fails to discharge her mandatory duty to set a special election for House District 70.”
“Since the focus of the Fiscal Session is how to spend the people’s tax dollars, the Proclamation imposes taxation without representation,” the complaint states.
Four registered voters in District 70 are plaintiffs in the case — Cordelia Smith-Johnson, Scott Perkins, Janie Ginocchio and Julie Rhodes. Smith-Johnson is also an announced candidate for the Democratic nomination in the special election. Plaintiffs are being represented by Kutak Rock LLP. Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester are the named defendants in the case.
“Right now voters are being denied a say in our state budget and denied representation in our statehouse. Good, hardworking taxpayers are being stymied, and that’s a problem,” Smith-Johnson said at Tuesday’s press conference.
Jones criticized Republicans who “rubberstamp” Sanders’ legislative agenda but said the lawsuit is nonpartisan. He called on Republican Party of Arkansas Chair Joseph Wood and any Republican candidates in the District 70 race to join in the lawsuit.
“I’m calling on you to do the right thing – to advocate for all citizens in House District 70,” Jones said. “Be on the right side of history.”
State law requires a special election to be held within 150 days unless it is impractical or “unduly burdensome” to do so, which Sanders said it would be in her proclamation. 
Feds considering immigration detention facility at Franklin County prison site

The governor made the same argument last month when selecting dates for a special election to fill the Senate District 26 seat left vacant by the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield. After bipartisan criticism, Sanders revised the SD 26 special election to March 3 and June 9, the same dates she later selected for the HD 70 special election. 
Of the 17 special elections that have been called between 2011 and 2022, nine were scheduled more than 150 days after the seat became vacant, that includes a 2014 election that was never officially scheduled because the new term would have expired four days after the special election. Stubblefield’s and Wing’s special elections are scheduled for 130 days and 102 days after the 150-day mark, respectively. The average number of days after the 150-day mark for the other occasions since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin County where the state has proposed building a 3,000-bed prison. Lawmakers are expected to vote on funding for the controversial project during next year’s fiscal session. 
Construction is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of the prison and voted against a $750 million appropriations bill that failed five times during the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Tuesday that he will seek a third term. 
Ellison is leading Minnesota’s pushback against the Trump administration in the courts, having filed dozens of lawsuits against the federal government this year, on topics ranging from trans athlete bans to cuts to education funding and programs for crime victims. 
Ellison has also been part of a coalition of Democratic attorneys general who are touting their court victories — largely in the form of temporary restraining orders blocking Trump administration actions while the legal process plays out — as a beacon of hope for liberal voters who want their elected officials to do more to push back on the Republicans who control the presidency and Congress. 
The move keeps Ellison in lockstep with Gov. Tim Walz, who is also running for a third term. Both were elected to Congress in 2006 — where Ellison represented the mostly-Minneapolis 5th District — then statewide office in 2018. 
A three-term AG isn’t new in Minnesota; Ellison’s predecessor, Lori Swanson, served three terms. Skip Humphrey was elected to four consecutive terms in the ‘80s and ‘90s. 
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has controlled the AG’s office for more than half a century. 
The attorney general is the state’s chief legal officer, representing state agencies in litigation, while also protecting consumers from fraud and enforcing antitrust laws, among other duties. The attorney general also prosecutes some criminal cases. Walz directed Ellison to take up the highest-profile criminal case in state history, the prosecution of Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd.
Ellison’s two prior statewide races were relatively close.

Details of services
There will be a Celebration of Life at the VFW in Hyde Park, VT on October 24th from 4-7pm with remembrances beginning at 5:30pm. There will be a private interment in early November in Eden.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a memorial gift to The Manor online via https://www.themanorvt.org/donate or volunteering there or in your community to enrich the lives of others.

Ernest “Stub” Earle, 84, passed away peacefully at The Manor in Morrisville, Vermont on October 10, 2025 with family by his side.  Born July 15, 1941 in Eden, VT into the loving homestead of his parents, Ernest Leigh Earle and Evelyn Dorothy Earle, and shaped by their generosity and that of the community in which he served.
He graduated from Johnson High School in 1959 and began dairy farming with his family in Eden. From farmer to politician, pickler and produce peddler, he lived a full and colorful life in “The Garden,” as he affectionately called it.
He was a prominent figure in Vermont politics in the 70s and early 80s, serving in the legislature for 12 years. During his time in Montpelier, he went on to serve as the Chair of the Fish and Game Committee, and was instrumental in the passing of the bottle deposit bill in the 1970s.  He was known for reaching across the aisle to pass legislation that benefited all Vermonters, regardless of political party. He was affectionately called “the Earle of Eden” by his legislative colleagues and lauded for his no-nonsense approach and ability to translate legislative rhetoric into plain spoken English. He was the last person to have a spittoon in the well of the Vermont House.
Epitomizing the spirit and flavor of “old Vermont,” he was often included in books dedicated to the subject.  From the late Peter Miller’s A Lifetime of Vermont People and Vanishing Vermonters, Loss of a Rural Culture to Real Vermonters Don’t Milk Goats by Frank Bryan and Bill Mares, you would often find his mischievous smile with a signature wool hat that kept time with the passing of the seasons.
He will be remembered for his fish fries, his cowbell at the many Vermont campgrounds as he did his summer loop peddling strawberries, produce, and his pickles; his uncanny ability to charm anyone into anything and his sponsorship of fellow AA members.
He was proud of his sobriety and the many relationships he forged in the AA community.  Sober since 2005, he died a “grateful, sober alcoholic.”
He thrived at The Manor and we would like to acknowledge our gratitude for the care he received and the love that is present at The Manor every day with every bingo game, every song sung and the daily commitment of the staff there to make it a home.  We would also like to thank Lamoille Home Health & Hospice for the end of life care they provided.
He is survived by his wife, Zobeida of Eden, his brother, Harold Earle (Emma) of Eden,  and his daughters: Carey Earle of Eden, Cathy Hom (Brett) of Colchester, Shannon Anderson of Danville, Kelly Hammond (Kevin) of Fuquay-Varina, NC and Ashley Earle of Morrisville; eight grandchildren; his uncle, Lawrence Earle of Morrisville;  his aunt, Carlene Lavallee of Swanton;  and many cousins, nieces, nephews as well as friendships that spanned both the state and the adventures that took him down country selling Christmas Trees and pine blankets.
He was predeceased by his parents, Ernest and Evelyn Earle.

The Siena Francis House began in 1975 when a Catholic priest, the Rev. Jack McCaslin, cashed in his life insurance to purchase an old house near downtown Omaha that initially served five women and their children. Two years later, another home was purchased to serve homeless men.
From those humble beginnings, the organization has grown into a $10 million-a-year operation with a paid staff of 108 that operates a shelter housing up to 460 unhoused individuals. They also manage a complex of 50 “tiny” houses and a subsidized apartment complex of 48 units.

Siena Francis, which attracts 2,600 volunteers a year, has added outreach and addiction recovery programs over the years, as well as a unique “respite care” unit for homeless people needing a place to recover from surgeries.
It is now the largest homeless shelter in the state, serving about 3,150 individuals every year.
The current executive director, Linda Twomey credits strong financial support from community leaders, the work of hundreds of staff and volunteers, as well as founders “who saw a need and really dug in there.”
In just the past eight years, Siena Francis has doubled its annual budget, more than doubled its staff, built a new $28 million shelter, established 98 permanent supportive housing units and renovated its addiction facility for its “Miracles Program.”
“The community of Omaha recognizes that people deserve dignity and access to services,” Twomey said.
To recognize its 50th anniversary, Siena Francis is holding a celebration luncheon on Wednesday. The featured speaker is Derek Leathers, who was once homeless but has since risen to serve as chairman and CEO of Werner Enterprises.
One former executive director of the operation, Mike Saklar, a former city planner, said that how a community treats its homeless population is a “benchmark” of the health of that community. Siena Francis House, he said, stands out in that measurement.

“It’s really served this community well in helping the most needy people,” said Saklar, who led the organization from 2002 to 2017.
“The Siena Francis House has been a critical partner to the city and other organizations as we look at humane ways to treat homelessness,” said Omaha Mayor John Ewing. He is a former member and president of the Siena Francis House board of directors. Ewing’s wife, Viv, also served.
The organization overcame some challenges along the way, and continued to operate, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and during a 30-hour power failure during a blizzard this year.
When Saklar first took the job, the homeless shelter was operating in the red, and was housing, at times, three times as many people as its capacity.
“It was really overcrowded,” he said. “Every night, we put all the dining room tables away and put mats on the floor for people to sleep.”
Saklar said he started knocking on doors, seeking contributions from Omaha philanthropic community, which soon followed.
“We had a really great mission,” he said, which was to end homelessness and get people into permanent housing and living stable lives.
It’s an even more daunting task for Siena Francis House because it is a “low-barrier” shelter, one that doesn’t turn someone away someone because they have a criminal record or have been kicked out of other shelters. Many of the homeless people served at Siena Francis also have untreated mental illness or addictions that have contributed to their problems.

“We take people that I often say are not the ‘Boy Scouts,’ ” Twomey said. “No one else will take them.”
“If we screened them like other shelters, most of them, maybe 75%, would have no other place to go,” she added.
Saklar said that while he was a city planner, he had worked with the then-executive director of Siena Francis, Paul Koch, on a master plan for the facility. It led to cleaning up a former auto junk yard and establishing the organization’s central campus, at 17th and Nicolaus Streets, north of downtown Omaha.
Twomey said that nationally, poverty is dropping, but not in Omaha. The homeless population is also shifting, she said — there’s more women and more people 55 years of age and older, plus it’s harder to find affordable housing and transitional housing.
“A few years ago, you might some someone with a cane or a walker. Now you see a couple dozen people with canes, walkers or wheelchairs,” Twomey said.
Right now, she’s holding her breath and hoping to see an increase in funding for mental health care and transitional housing. At the moment, Twomey said, the federal government’s policies tend to be at odds with Siena Francis’ focus on intensive counseling, ending chronic homelessness and “housing first.”
The organization’s approach appears to be working. Last year, 500 homeless people it served were moved to permanent housing, which she said is likely a record, and over and over, in a video produced for Siena Francis’ 50th anniversary celebration, former clients said the care they received had “saved their lives.”
The video is entitled, “50 years of impact and inspiring hope.”
“Without Siena Francis House, I’d either be dead or in prison,” said one former client, Eric Lind, who now volunteers at the organization. His life, he said, has improved “1,000 percent.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Leading Catholic officials in western South Dakota have issued a statement saying they “firmly reject” the secretary of defense’s recent affirmation of medals awarded for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre.
The written statement is from the Most Rev. Scott Bullock, bishop of Rapid City, and the De Smet Jesuit Community of West River, South Dakota. The faith leaders said the facts of the historical tragedy are “clear,” and the massacre “was not a battle.”
“Those who died at Wounded Knee are sacred. Jesus stands with all who suffer and die at the hands of others,” said the statement, issued Monday. “Those who committed the violence are also sacred; for this reason, Jesus offers them mercy and healing. Yet the acts themselves were grave evils and cannot be honored.”
Focus on individual conduct instead of massacre doomed Wounded Knee medals review, panelist says

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced last month that the medals awarded to soldiers for their participation in the massacre will not be rescinded. He called the massacre a “battle” and said soldiers “deserve” the medals they were awarded.
Hegseth’s predecessor during the Biden administration, Lloyd Austin, created a panel last year to review the medals. At the time, the Department of Defense said “approximately 20” soldiers had received a Medal of Honor for participating in the massacre. Historians have said the records associated with some of the medals are incomplete or unclear.
There was no public report from the panel and no public action on the matter before Biden left office. Hegseth made his announcement in a social media video, while holding a report that he said was generated by the panel. The Defense Department has not published the report or responded to South Dakota Searchlight’s requests for a copy.
Hegseth said the review panel recommended against rescinding the medals, and he alleged that Austin declined to publicize the recommendation because “he was more interested in being politically correct than historically correct.”
The Catholic faith leaders addressed that criticism in their statement.
“To recognize these acts as honorable is to distort history itself,” the statement said. “Our response, therefore, is rooted not in ‘political correctness’ but in prayerful correctness, grounded in truth, conscience, and compassion.”
The massacre occurred after years of conflict between the Lakota nation and the U.S. government had concluded with many Lakota people ordered onto reservations. On Dec. 29, 1890, a large group of Lakota people traveling to the Pine Ridge Agency in southwestern South Dakota made camp near Wounded Knee Creek, where they were surrounded by hundreds of Army soldiers. A shot rang out while the soldiers tried to disarm the camp, and the soldiers opened fire.
Fewer than 40 soldiers were killed (some by friendly fire, according to historians), while estimates of Lakota deaths ran from 200 to 300 or more, depending on the source, including men, women and children. After some of the bodies froze on the ground for several days, a military-led burial party placed them in a mass grave.
One hundred years later in 1990, Congress passed a resolution expressing “deep regret” for the massacre.

(Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission)Florida officials have tripled the number of invasive Burmese pythons removed in a year since partnering with a leather company that turns invasive species into fashion, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday.
DeSantis was joined by Inversa Leathers CEO Aarav Chavda at a Stuart press conference Tuesday morning, where he revealed that 748 pythons were removed from the Everglades in July 2025 versus 235 removals in July 2024, since Inversa began to partner with Florida authorities.
Based in Miami, the company’s website boasts stylish items like wallets, shoes, belts, dresses, and more made from Burmese Pythons in Florida, Lionfish off of Florida’s coasts, and the Silverfin carp in the Mississippi River Basin — all invasive species that harm American ecosystems.
“As of today, we can celebrate the fact that they delivered on their objective, one and a half years ahead of schedule. That’s right. In the first three months since transitioning to the program with Inversa … [Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission] and Inversa have tripled the number of python removals,” DeSantis announced.
“We had 1,022 removals across May and July of this year compared to 343 removals during the same period last year. FWC management workload is down 89%, giving staff biologists valuable time,” he continued. “ In the month of July alone, the program removed more pythons than the entire 12 months pre-transition. That’s incredible.”
Florida has rushed to address the growing problem of Burmese pythons in the Everglades since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 destroyed a breeding facility, releasing snakes into the wild, and exacerbated by exotic pet owners importing the Southeast Asian snakes to keep as pets, then releasing them into the nearby swamp when the snakes inevitably grew too large to keep. Burmese pythons can grow to 20 feet and weigh more than 250 pounds, with females larger than males, USGS reported.
The invasive snakes — which have no natural predator in South Florida — pose a heightened danger to the natural species in the Everglades, particularly to the three dozen threatened or endangered land and sea creatures residing in the massive national park.
As a result, Florida in 2013 began an annual python challenge to capture as many Burmese Pythons within 10 days as possible for a prize. DeSantis in 2019 worked with FWC and the Department of Environmental Protection to remove pythons across all Florida state parks.
“We’re putting a bounty on the head of every one of these pythons,” DeSantis said.

Pat Outman (R-Six Lakes) speaks in favor of House Bill 4861, which would change state election law to  remove the requirement for non-partisan candidates to declare a party affiliation on their affidavits of identity. Oct. 21, 2025. | ScreenshotThe Michigan House of Representatives is considering a change to election law to help non-partisan candidates avoid getting kicked off the ballot due to technicality in the filing process.
Members of the House Election Integrity Committee on Tuesday discussed House Bill 4861, which would remove the requirement for non-partisan candidates to declare a party affiliation on their affidavits of identity.
Lawmakers supporting the bill said the change was necessary because the technicality in question has kept some non-partisan candidates from reaching the ballot based on legal challenges to their affidavits of identity, a document that must be turned in to the Michigan Department of State by the filing deadline in a given election year.










In doing so, we ensure that quality candidates are not excluded from the ballot over a confusing and quite frankly unnecessary paperwork requirement.


– State Rep. Pat Outman (R-Six Lakes)


State Rep. Pat Outman (R-Six Lakes) sponsored the bill. Outman told the committee that candidates for partisan office are required by law to note their party affiliations on the forms by notching one of three check boxes.
The current form does have a box for a non-partisan office without party affiliation, but Outman said judicial candidates have a long-standing tradition of not checking any of the boxes because the non-partisan nature of the race is implied.
That’s led some litigious Michigan residents to challenge those affidavits of identity in court as being incomplete or out of step with election law, which has in turn led to the disqualification of otherwise qualified candidates.
“In fact, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled on this issue in Davis v Highland Park City Clerk, where even [retired Justice David Viviano] pointed out that the law is unclear and urged the Legislature to step in and fix it,” Outman said. “He noted that it makes little sense to force candidates for non-partisan offices to affirm they’re running without party designation when their names already appear in a separate section of the ballot where no party label can appear.”
Outman said the bill was a commonsense change.
“In doing so, we ensure that quality candidates are not excluded from the ballot over a confusing and quite frankly unnecessary paperwork requirement,” he said.
Testifying in support of the bill was Wayne 3rd Circuit Court Judges Kelly Ramsey and Margaret Van Houten.
Ramsey was subject to a legal challenge over her affidavit of identity in 2022, where serial litigator Robert Davis sued over her form being incomplete.
“It subjected me and other members of my bench to considerable stress, aggravation and, quite frankly, financial loss,” Ramsey said. “And it has to do with the fact that I left the line blank regarding party affiliation when I was running for a non-partisan office, and that was the subject matter of the lawsuit. … Had it not been for the [litigant’s] late filing [of the case, which saw it thrown out], I fear I would have been taken off the ballot. We were not successful based on the merits, we were successful in a lawsuit based on [a doctrine determining an unreasonable timing delay].”
State Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids) said the change makes “ample sense,” but noted that the current form has been updated to allow a non-partisan candidate to check a box indicating that they are running for that office with no party affiliation.
Still, Wooden said it would be wise to change the law for greater clarity, and also to buffer in statute changes that could be made administratively by the executive offices later.
Outman said that was accurate, and it appears the Department of State has corrected the issue on its end. It was still important, Outman added, to make the change in statute.
Supporting the bill but not wishing to speak were representatives from the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks, the Department of State, the State Court Administrative Office, Pure Integrity Michigan Elections and the Michigan Judges Association.
The committee did not take a vote on advancing the bill.

Trustees unanimously approved Limayem, who’d spent 2012-2022 as a dean at USF before a three-year term at the helm of UNF in 2022.
“I remember getting that call from their [UNF’s] chairman, asking me what I thought about Moez, and I told him, ‘You couldn’t find a better president, and I hope one day we get him back.’ To me, this is a story of a favorite son of USF who’s coming home,” Board of Trustees Chair Will Weatherford said during a special meeting Tuesday morning.
President Rhea Law announced in February that she would step down upon completion of the search for her replacement. The search yielded Limayem as the sole finalist last month. Last week, USF hosted Limayem for forums with campus stakeholders.
“Every corner I visited last week reminded me of some incredible memories, assignments and announcements, and meetings, and sometimes even some faculty members asking for salary raises. This is home for us. Our kids grew up here. Tampa is the city that I lived in the longest since birth,” Limayem said.
The State University Sysem Board of Governors is set to vote on Limayem’s presidency on Nov. 6. That meeting is scheduled to take place at USF.
Limayem concluded his confirmation remarks by jokingly asking Weatherford to call the Board of Governors to schedule the confirmation meeting for later in the day.
“Because I cannot wait. I really cannot wait to work with this incredible faculty, staff, board, and friends to move USF forward, upward,” Limayem said.

Moez 3.0
What he’s gained since being away from Tampa, he said, is better understanding of performance-based funding metrics, the Board of Governors, and relationships with lawmakers.
“When I came here in 2012, it was Moez version 1.0. When I left here to go to UNF, that was Moez 2.0. Today, I really believe I am Moez 3.0 with no artificial intelligence enhancements,” Limayem said.
Fundraising, athletics, and diversity, equity, and inclusion were among the questions from trustees. The approximately 40 minutes of question and answers included jokes from Limayem and laughter from trustees.
“As the president, I am committed to all our faculty, staff, and students to give them the best infrastructure, all the factors they need to be successful; that all programs, initiatives, centers, engagement opportunity will be open to all students,” Limayem said.
The Board of Governors rejected former University of Florida President-Elect Santa Ono for his stances on DEI.
Earlier this year, the Phoenix reported about Gov. Ron DeSantis’ installation of allies at universities in a purge of “ideological concepts.”
If the governors confirm Limayem, USF will have swerved a trend of selecting presidents with histories of political service — unlike Florida International University, Florida Atlantic University, New College of Florida, Florida A&M University, and at the University of West Florida (an interim president).
Search committee chair Mike Griffin cited Limayem’s presence at Board of Governors meetings and understanding of “the importance of metrics” and of faculty in supporting his candidacy as the president-elect.
“I just really believe that Moez is the right leader at the right time and we’re just completely aligned on our priorities,” Griffin said.
Fundraising has become an increasingly important quality for university presidents. USF, in announcing Limayem’s new position, boasted about his $126 million raised during his deanship, including a $25 million gift from Pan and Les Muma, for whom the college of business is named.
“I’ve been asked many times, how is Moez today different from Moez we’ve known for a decade as the dean of the Muma College of Business. Let me assure you, Moez today is the same, with the same values, with the same morals, and with the same compass. More energy, more passion, than ever before,” Limayem said.
Before starting at USF in 2012, Limayem was at the University of Arkansas as an associate dean. He was born in Tunisia, where he earned his undergraduate degree. He attended the University of Minnesota for his master’s and doctoral degrees in information systems.
Weatherford said Limayem’s selection is “a great personification of the American story. Him coming here, and what he’s achieved in his life in this country, is just something that people write movies and books about people’s lives like this.”
“Sometimes when you look far and wide, sometimes the answer is right in front of you,” Griffin said, adding that he’s spent “hundreds of hours” on the search process and received “mounds upon mounds of documentation and supporting materials.”
USF kept with a trend of announcing a sole finalist for the position despite regulations requiring “an unranked list of final applicants.” Florida International University and the University of Florida, twice, did the same.
Law posted to social media Tuesday, congratulating Limayem.

Congratulations to Dr. Limayem on his selection by the Board of Trustees! While I have known Dr. Limayem and his family for years, I was delighted to spend some time with him today and on his recent campus visit and he expressed genuine excitement to return home to #USF and… pic.twitter.com/n3upziRqTy

The federal government gives Wyoming about $62 million a year for food benefits, and the state would have to show changes to the program make SNAP participants healthier.
The post Lawmakers seek to remove soda, candy, spices and others from SNAP benefits appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—As the future of SNAP benefits, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is up in the air amid the federal government shutdown, Wyoming lawmakers are looking to update the program by prohibiting participants from purchasing certain items, ranging from soft drinks to candy and mustard to spices.
However, state officials also say this move could end up costing Wyoming taxpayers $3.1 million.
On Friday, the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee discussed a SNAP benefits waiver request, outlined in a bill intended to mandate that the state take aggressive action to limit the purchase of certain items through the program. Officially, the bill draft requires the director of the Department of Family Services to request a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In the meeting, DFS Director Korin Schmidt provided an overview of SNAP in Wyoming, noting that it is a federal program, and the federal government provides 100% of the food benefits, which amount to approximately $62 million a year in Wyoming. 
The state’s responsibility lies in administering SNAP, including determining eligibility based on income and household size. Wyoming serves a monthly average of 28,364 recipients, 44% of whom are children.
The core of the bill requires DFS to request a waiver to exclude candy and soft drinks from the definition of eligible food purchases.
Schmidt said that this request would be a demonstration waiver. This means that, if approved, the department would need to demonstrate this aspect of the program truly makes the SNAP population healthier, achieving one of the goals of the program.
She said implementation of the change could last around one year, with testing occurring over the two following years.
Under the federal Big Beautiful Bill passed by Congress earlier this year, the program’s administrative complexity has increased, Schmidt said, and is slated to decrease the federal match for administrative costs from 50% to 25% beginning in October 2026.

There is also a penalty if the state is found to have an error rate at or greater than 6%, which is monitored by the federal government. This rate is determined by how accurately Wyoming identifies eligibility and distributes the correct amount of funds.
If the error rate exceeds the limit, the state must pay 5% of the food costs, which would be around $3.1 million for Wyoming. Last year, the statewide error rate was 5.1%, and Schmidt said her department is currently hovering around 4.1%.
To administer the new waiver request without risking a penalty, which includes conducting the study, Schmidt estimated an annual cost of $650,000 for three years. She warned that proceeding without additional funding would force the agency to repurpose existing staff, potentially increasing administrative stress and jeopardizing the low error rate.
Several legislators expressed concern regarding the administrative burden versus the policy goal. 
Sen. Lynn Hutchings, R-Cheyenne, viewed the waiver not as a burden, but as being accountable for other people’s money, seeking to promote healthier recipients who might become gainfully employed.
“Overall, we’re going to try to create or assist in a better and a healthier human being. So, to me, it’s not a burden. It seems like it’s an accountability issue,” she said.
Conversely, Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Torrington, questioned why such a large health study was needed, arguing the government shouldn’t act as “big brother” and should simply enforce the original intent of the Farm Bill, which authorizes SNAP, of funding staple commodities, not candy or soft drinks.
The discussion also touched on federal incentives. Jeff Darty, speaking on behalf of FGA Action, a conservative Florida-based advocacy group, noted that the bill aligns with key federal policy initiatives like Make America Healthy Again. He said states that submit these waivers are positioned to receive additional funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program, which is also outlined in the Big Beautiful Bill.
Retailers, however, voiced concern. 
“I have a hard time when a 16-year-old cashier is the policeman of such things.” Jim Benedict, grocery store Owner
Jim Benedict, who owns a grocery store in Mountain View, and Sarah Pettit, public affairs director of Associated Food Stores, stressed the necessity of clear definitions.
“At a retail level, I have a hard time when a 16-year-old cashier is the policeman of such things, and if the definitions are there and it’s in place and the participants know exactly what they can buy, that takes the pressure off of us at retail,” Benedict said.
Pettit noted that the current definition of “candy” might unintentionally exclude items like trail mix, granola bars and protein bars, complicating point-of-sale systems and confusing customers.
The initial draft defined “candy” as a preparation of natural or artificial sweeteners, chocolate, fruit, nuts, or other flavorings, and a “soft drink” as a nonalcoholic beverage containing natural or artificial sweeteners, with exceptions for milk and high-juice content.
Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, moved to amend the definition to strike the phrase “or artificial” sweeteners from both definitions. He argued this would create a positive incentive, moving recipients away from sugary sodas toward diet or sugar-free options, thus taking them “one step closer to being healthier.” This amendment failed.
Chairwoman Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, then proposed a significant amendment to expand the scope beyond just candy and soft drinks. Relying on federal terminology, she moved to amend the bill to prohibit the acquisition of “accessory foods” in general.
“I believe it’s safe to say that there really is no place for these accessory foods, based on all the education that I’ve seen your agency provide over the years,” she said to Schmidt.
The committee clarified that “accessory foods” include items generally considered snack foods or desserts, things like chips, ice cream and cookies, but also items that supplement meals, such as coffee, tea, cocoa, condiments, spices, salt and sugar.
Despite pushback from some members who felt banning spices and condiments went too far into the weeds and would make the bill too complex, the amendment to replace “candy and soft drinks” with the broader category of “accessory foods” passed.
Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, proposed an amendment to provide a $1.3 million appropriation and two full-time positions for DFS staff to execute the waiver’s health study over three years, but the amendment failed.
The final bill draft passed 12-2, with Scott and Yin casting the only votes opposed to the bill. It will be considered by the full Legislature when the budget session begins in February.

The U.S. Supreme Court justice, part of the court’s three-member liberal bloc, urged university students in attendance not to ""walk away from the fight.""

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor spoke to a packed house at the University of Vermont’s Ira Allen Chapel on Monday night about her life, the role of lawyers and the power of dissent.
The justice, in conversation with UVM President Marlene Tromp, talked about her life and career, offered advice for young students in attendance and, briefly, addressed the state of politics in the country. Her appearance was part of the university’s second annual Leahy Public Policy Forum series.
“We are in a difficult part of American history, and we have great risk right now of our republic government changing in some fundamental ways,” she said. “I’m not going to tell you to not be worried. You have and should be worried. But what you shouldn’t do is walk away from the fight.”
She later said that if America “loses the value of understanding that America was built on the backs of immigrants,” and that the country continues to thrive from the children of immigrants, “then we’ll stop being great, because that’s how we got to where we are.”
Sotomayor, 71, has been a liberal stalwart on the court since her appointment by former President Barack Obama in 2009. She is one of three justices typically associated with the court’s liberal bloc, along with justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
She is the first Latina to sit on the nation’s highest court, and was the third woman to be confirmed.
Sotomayor’s talk comes several weeks into a Supreme Court term with much at stake. The court has heard, or is scheduled to hear, arguments in a number of high-profile cases centered around transgender high school athletes’ participation in sports, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and immigrants’ right to asylum.
Sotomayor spent the first part of her day on Monday speaking with elementary students in Burlington, Winooski and Charlotte — reading from her children’s book, “Just Shine! How to Be a Better You.” She later answered questions from a group of UVM students and alumni before the event.
Tickets for Monday’s event sold out as soon as they went live earlier this month, university officials said. The justice was welcomed with remarks by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, and former senator Patrick Leahy, who was not in attendance but addressed the crowd in a recorded video message.
Sotomayor, during the Monday night event, spoke about her childhood growing up in the Bronx, and her mother’s influence on her life. Asked by Tromp whether she had received any advice that held special value with her, Sotomayor said she’s “never been afraid to ask a question,” and that she’s never been afraid to say, “I don’t know.”
“Too many people are afraid of being embarrassed by saying, ‘I don’t know,'” she said.
She encouraged students in the audience to be bold and press on through adversity. Asked about what motivated her early in her career, Sotomayor said people have to “be a little stupid.”
“Sometimes you just have to jump — be a little stupid,” she said. “Do what you think is something different or exciting. And if you get it wrong, change course, do something else.”
Sotomayor graduated from Princeton University in 1976 and received her law degree from Yale Law School. She later worked as an assistant district attorney in New York.
While in New York, she worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, an experience she said introduced her to a “wider world than I would have ever known.”

From there, she rose through the federal court system. She was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Court of New York in 1991. Five years later, President Bill Clinton nominated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, also based in Manhattan.
Sotomayor, who has been lauded for her impassioned legal dissents, was asked by Tromp what dissent means to her “and what it should mean to us.”
The justice said the law is often perceived as “black and white” and said there was a “gray area” in the interpretation of the law. Dissenting, she said, “illuminates that gray area” for the public.
“Whether that view has or has not convinced my colleagues” on the Supreme Court, “they’re not my only audience,” she said. Her legal opinions are meant to speak to the broader public, she said, and sometimes to Congress to say “do your job and fix it.”
“That’s been a little more difficult” recently, she said, but “that hasn’t always been the case.”
Sotomayor later gave advice for students choosing to study law. Lawyers, she said, are there “to fight for the lost causes — to help people who are in need of a voice because they feel the system is stacked against them.” 
Part of the job of a lawyer is accepting there will be cases you will lose, she said, especially if you are involved “in civil rights cases.”
But “we lose the war when you walk away,” she said. “So long as people and lawyers and young people are still fighting to create a better America … we still have hope in the world.”

(Photo provided by Gallrein campaign)A Shelbyville Republican who President Donald Trump publicly endorsed to challenge Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie last week formally entered the race Tuesday. 
However, Massie says he remains committed to being an “independent conservative voice” for voters in the state’s 4th Congressional District. 
Trump introduced Ed Gallrein, a former Navy SEAL and businessman, to national politics last week with a lengthy post to Truth Social, encouraging him to unseat Massie. The incumbent congressman has become a thorn in the side of the president, opposing him on prominent issues like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and leading the charge to release the federal investigation files into convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein. 
“I’ve dedicated my life to serving my country, and I’m ready to answer the call again,” Gallrein said in a statement Tuesday morning. “This district is Trump Country. The President doesn’t need obstacles in Congress – he needs backup. I’ll defeat Thomas Massie, stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump, and deliver the America First results Kentuckians voted for.”
The press release from the Gallrein campaign highlighted Trump’s “Complete and Total Endorsement,” which also was highly critical of Massie. Trump said the congressman is “a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, a place I love, and won big SIX TIMES” who “must be thrown out of office, ASAP!”
Gallrein followed the president’s lead, adding that Massie “has become one of the biggest roadblocks to President Trump’s America First agenda” and vowed to stand with Trump. 
Leading up to Gallrein’s announcement, a super PAC tied to the president spent more than $1 million on ads against the congressman before a challenger candidate was named. 
The Republican primary in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District is shaping up to pit two wings of the party against each other — Trump Republicans vs. Massie’s Libertarian base. 
Since Trump’s endorsement was issued last week, Massie has written Gallrein off as a “failed candidate and establishment hack.” Gallrein lost a competitive Republican primary to state Sen. Aaron Reed in the 7th Senate District last year.
Following Gallrein’s announcement Tuesday, Massie said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern: “The uniparty in DC finally found someone willing to be a rubber stamp for globalist billionaires, endless debt, foreign aid, and forever wars in failed candidate and Lindsey Graham donor Ed Gallrein.” Massie has been circulating on X a 2020 donation from Gallrein to the South Carolina senator’s campaign committee.
“Fourth district voters appreciate having an independent conservative voice who works for them and I look forward to continuing my fight for transparency, constitutional rights, secure borders, a true America-first foreign policy, and fiscal responsibility,” Massie said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f0338176-bfc1-451c-88ed-a9af7715810f-1024x634.jpg,,,2025-10-21 13:17:43.125788

Wyoming Highway Patrol directed capitol staff and visitors to leave the building and an investigation is underway. 
The post Wyoming State Capitol evacuated amid investigation of a suspicious package appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Highway Patrol ordered the evacuation of the state Capitol building on Tuesday morning after discovery of a suspicious package, according to the director of the Legislative Service Office.
WHP troopers were on scene at the capitol, department spokesperson Aaron Brown told WyoFile, though he said he was not yet able to confirm what spurred the evacuation. An investigation was ongoing, he said just after 10:20 a.m.
In a 10:49 a.m. post to the social media site X, Wyoming Highway Patrol officials indicated the building remained evacuated and asked people to “please avoid the area” of the state capitol. 
LSO director Matt Obrecht told WyoFile officials from the state law enforcement agency, which oversees capitol security, requested the evacuation because of a package. He did not have any further information, he said. 
When the evacuation order was issued, Gov. Mark Gordon, State Treasurer Curt Meier and State Auditor Kristi Racines were all gathered in the Capitol Extension for a regular meeting of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission.
The commission’s executive director, Anthony Apollo, was speaking mid-sentence when the meeting was abruptly stopped at around 10 a.m.
“To anyone on the call, we are currently evacuating the building, to be addressed at a later point in time,” Apollo announced as he gathered his things.
The exit confused and concerned the commission members and staff who had Zoomed into the meeting.
“I hope everyone is OK,” said Commissioner Flavia Naves.
In September 2024, a suspicious powder sent to the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office prompted an evacuation of the nearby Herschler Building, which houses several state agencies including the State Treasurer’s Office, the Department of Education and the Department of Revenue.
On Jan. 6, 2021, state troopers locked down the Capitol and Herschler buildings during the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Several hundred people were protesting outside the Wyoming Capitol, and troopers heard “worrying remarks” in the crowd, they told WyoFile at the time.

Dan McKee received the dubious distinction of having the lowest approval rating of any governor nationwide, according to Morning Consult’s quarterly survey. 
The findings published on Oct. 15 paint a grim picture for Rhode Island’s sitting governor, who scored favorable marks with 4 in 10 voters surveyed by the global consulting firm. It’s also the lowest approval rating and highest disapproval rating McKee has faced in quarterly polls by Morning Consult since he became governor in 2021.
Among state governors, McKee had the third-highest disapproval rate — 44% — behind Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds at 53% and Maine’s Democratic Gov. Janet Mills at 45%.
Unlike Reynolds and Mills, though, McKee must win back voters next year in order to secure another term as governor. Reynolds has already announced she won’t run for reelection, while Mills just announced her campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
McKee’s campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday. 
Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott boasted the nation’s highest approval rating — 75% — while Connecticut’s Ned Lamont and Massachusetts’ Maura Healey, both Democrats, came in the top 10, with 63% approval for Lamont and 59% for Healey. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte had a 53% approval rating.
The governor has been plagued by low approval ratings for more than a year — many polls showing even less favorable results than Morning Consult.
His 2026 Democratic opponent, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, came out with a leading edge over McKee in a hypothetical primary, though most voters remain undecided, according to a recent survey by the University of New Hampshire.
Foulkes, a former CVS executive who lost to McKee in the 2022 gubernatorial primary by 3 percentage points, is the only declared challenger for next year’s gubernatorial race. However, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi remains a possible candidate, though the Warwick Democrat has sidestepped direct questions on a gubernatorial campaign.
The Morning Consult survey reflects results of more than 250,000 registered voters nationwide over the three-month period that ended Sept. 30. The margin of error ranged from 1% to 6% depending on the state population. Information on the sample of Rhode Island voters was not immediately available.

(Photo courtesy of Carroll campaign)A Stafford County Circuit Court judge dismissed a lawsuit by three local voters seeking to remove Democratic House of Delegates nominee Stacey Carroll from the ballot, rejecting claims that she doesn’t actually live in the district where she’s running.
The ruling, made public on Friday, ends weeks of uncertainty in the closely watched 64th District race between Carroll, a military veteran and accountant, and Del. Paul Milde, the Republican incumbent. 
The petitioners — Stafford County GOP Chair Steve Schwartz, Judith Anne Parker and Juliet McGee Schweiter — had argued that Carroll’s voter registration was invalid because she allegedly resides at her longtime home in neighboring House District 23, not at the address she used to qualify for the 64th.
Carroll, who previously called the allegations “false and insulting,” celebrated the court’s decision as a victory for voters.
“I am grateful that the court recognized the facts and dismissed this baseless attempt to undermine the will of the voters of the 64th District,” Carroll said in an email. 
“This lawsuit was nothing more than a failed political attempt to disenfranchise voters and deny them the opportunity to decide who is best suited to represent their community.”
She added that her campaign would now “push forward and continue to focus on what truly matters — meeting voters where they are and making the case for the strong, accountable leadership that Stafford deserves.”
 Lawsuit challenged Carroll’s voter registration

The petition, filed in late August, contended that Carroll’s February voter registration change to an address on Pinkerton Court in District 64 was improper because she “continues to reside” on Bismark Drive in District 23 — a home she has owned since 2018. 
The plaintiffs said their case relied on months of observation and public records they claimed showed Carroll never actually moved.
According to their complaint, Carroll’s “primary vehicle, a white 2017 Cadillac Escalade,” was regularly seen parked at the Bismark Drive residence overnight. They also asserted that she continued to receive mail and pay utility bills there and that her certified public accountant license still listed the Bismark address.
At the Pinkerton Court home, which records show is owned by another family, the plaintiffs alleged they saw “no activity consistent with a change in residency.”
The petitioners asked the court to cancel Carroll’s registration in District 64, decertify her candidacy and remove her name from the ballot before the November election.
Carroll, who lives in Stafford with her husband and children, denied the allegations and accused her opponents of weaponizing residency laws to discourage voter participation, particularly among military families who move frequently.
 Court rejects residency claims

In dismissing the lawsuit, the court sided with Carroll’s argument that the plaintiffs had not met the legal burden of proving she failed to establish domicile in District 64. Virginia’s Constitution and election laws require candidates to live in the districts they seek to represent, defining “residence” as a combination of physical presence and intent to remain.
Those standards, established in the 1966 Kegley v. Johnson decision and reaffirmed in subsequent cases, have made it difficult for challengers to prove residency violations without clear evidence of deceit or dual domiciles.
The judge’s ruling echoed a 2023 Chesterfield County case in which petitioners unsuccessfully sought to remove state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — now the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor — from the ballot over similar claims. That challenge, too, relied on surveillance-style observations of vehicles and time spent at a previous home.
Election attorneys say such cases often hinge on circumstantial evidence and rarely succeed unless the candidate openly admits to living elsewhere.
 Broader context

The Stafford case drew attention partly because it invoked a little-used provision of Virginia law allowing voters to challenge another person’s registration under Virginia Code § 24.2-431. 
Similar provisions were used in 2011 when a group of Loudoun County voters tried, unsuccessfully, to disqualify Republican House candidate David Ramadan from the ballot.
Each time, courts have emphasized that determining domicile involves not just where a person sleeps but also where they intend to make their home.
The Stafford lawsuit also named the county’s General Registrar Anna Hash, the Virginia State Board of Elections and the Department of Elections as respondents, asserting that all had improperly accepted Carroll’s voter registration.
But the court found no evidence of wrongdoing by election officials and declined to interfere with the administrative certification process.
 Political implications

The dismissal comes as early voting is underway across Virginia, with all 100 House of Delegates seats and three statewide offices on the Nov. 4 ballot. The 64th District, which includes much of Stafford County, has emerged as a key battleground that could help determine control of the House next year.
Carroll, who served more than a decade in the U.S. Army and later worked as a CPA, is running on a platform focused on veterans’ services, education funding and fiscal accountability. Milde, a former county supervisor who flipped the seat red in 2023, has emphasized lowering taxes and curbing government spending.
The court’s decision removes a major distraction for Carroll’s campaign heading into the final weeks of the race.
“I thank the judge for this ruling, and look forward to continuing to serve the 64th District. Onward,” she said in the email.

(Photo courtesy of Theo Henry)Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said federal immigration authorities postponed her tour of the Maine field office due to the government shutdown. 
“A government shutdown doesn’t suspend congressional oversight,” Pingree said in a statement to Maine Morning Star. “Delaying a tour of the facility under that pretext is unacceptable and only heightens concerns about detainees’ access to attorneys. We are continuing to press until we get the transparency and accountability our communities deserve.”
In late September, Pingree sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requesting a tour of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Scarborough, following several reports that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at the facility. 
After setting initial plans for a tour, the local office told Pingree’s team it would have to be rescheduled, relaying the message from their higher ups in light of the shutdown. 
ICE and DHS did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s requests for comment.
Pingree also asked Noem whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if it does, its legal justification. 
The representative requested a written response within 30 days of receipt of the Sept. 22 letter. As of Oct. 21, Pingree had yet to receive a response.

The reason, Judge Lisa White Hardwick wrote in the unanimous decision, is because Plocher was not former House Clerk Dana Miller’s supervisor and could not fire her or discipline her for speaking out about his alleged wrongdoing. 
Plocher may have believed he had power over Miller, Hardwick wrote, but in reality the most he could do was seek a full House vote to remove her — something he never formally attempted. 
“…while Plocher may have expressed a desire to supervise, control and remove Miller as chief clerk,” the decision said, “he had no authority to do so.”
The lawsuit was filed by Miller last year accusing Plocher of trying to get her removed from her job after she cooperated with a House Ethics Committee investigation into his attempts to steer an $800,000 software contract for the House around the standard bidding process and revelations that he illegally sought taxpayer reimbursement from the legislature for airfare, hotels and other travel costs already paid for by his campaign.
Plocher denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations sparked a months-long investigation. Though it was ultimately dismissed, the Republican legislator leading the inquiry said Plocher pressured potential witnesses and used his office to obstruct the committee’s work. 
Speaker Dean Plocher accused of ‘absolute obstruction’ in House ethics investigation

An investigator’s report released by the ethics committee detailed how some potential witnesses allegedly refused to speak out of fear Plocher would use his power as speaker to retaliate against them, while others did not appear because Plocher decided who the committee could compel to testify. 
The speaker and chief clerk of the House are the two officers of the chamber named in the Missouri Constitution. Both are elected by a majority vote as the chamber reorganizes after an election.
Miller argued that after she reported “what she reasonably believed were violations of the law, rules and/or regulations, and policy; mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; a waste of public resources; and/or breaches of professional ethical canons,” she was subjected to acts of retaliation and threats of disciplinary action directed against her by Plocher. 
She should be considered a whistleblower, her lawsuit argues, because her decision to report alleged misconduct was the motivating factor in Plocher targeting her for retaliation and threatening her employment. 
Plocher’s attorneys asserted that Miller’s claims to be a whistleblower fell short because Plocher was not her supervisor and was incapable of taking any disciplinary action against her. 
The case was dismissed by a Cole County judge in December. The appeals court upheld the dismissal Tuesday.
“Plocher had no more authority over Miller than any other House member had over her,” Hardwick wrote in the court’s decision. 
Miller retired last year after 31 years in state government, including 23 years as a member of the House staff. She was elected chief clerk in 2018 and held that post under four Republican speakers. 
Plocher left office last year due to term limits after running unsuccessfully for Missouri secretary of state.

Over 51% of residents felt that the state was “on the right track,” while less than 34% felt that it was on the wrong track. That is a rise from the last poll in April, a shift mostly driven by an increase in Republican voters agreeing with the direction of the state. 
However, when asked the same question about the economy specifically, voters were split almost exactly evenly, with Democratic voters expressing much more positive opinions than Republicans and Independents. Nearly 40% of those who said the economy was going in the wrong direction cited inflation as the cause of this. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That inflation, those polled said, is impacting a wide range of purchases, including groceries and food, utilities, and insurance. 
But that does not necessarily translate to shifting political support — of those who strongly approve of President Donald Trump, over half are paying more for groceries, utilities and insurance, and still strongly support the president.
That fact underscored a major takeaway from the poll, said Richard Czuba, the founder of the Glengariff Group, which conducted the survey.
“It used to be, how you viewed the economy is how you viewed the party in power,” he said. “That is now reversing in all of our numbers. We’re increasingly seeing that how you view the party in power is how you view the economy.”


The poll also emphasized the outsized impact of federal policies, especially tariffs, on Michiganders. 

“The results of this poll reinforce what the chamber has been saying regarding federal trade and tariff policy that Michigan, Michigan’s workers and Michigan’s businesses are at a disproportionate disadvantage of these policies compared to most other states,” said Sandy Baruah, the president and chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Chamber. “In other words, the trade policies, the tariff policies that are being pursued in Washington are having a much more negative effect on Michigan than they are in most other states.”
When it comes to tariffs, nearly twice as many Michigan residents believed that they were bad for the state’s economy compared to those who thought that they were good. 
That was particularly true among households with someone in the automotive industry, nearly 51% of whom opposed tariffs. Sixty percent of Michiganders — and up to 66% of those in automotive households — said that “the automotive industry continues to bear disproportionate impacts and risks associated with tariffs.”
Automotive households were also more concerned about losing their jobs, nearly a third saying that this was a concern, compared to only 13% of all other workers. 










It used to be, how you viewed the economy is how you viewed the party in power. That is now reversing in all of our numbers. We’re increasingly seeing that how you view the party in power is how you view the economy.


– Pollster Richard Czuba, founder of the Glengariff Group


Other opposition to tariffs came from support for Canada as an economic ally to Michiganders. 
“The views on Canada as an economic friend have always been high, but in this poll, they have surged even higher overall,” Baruah said. “Those who say our neighbors in Canada are an economic friend have increased from 68% in January to 79% in this September poll, a really strong indication that Michiganders truly understand the importance of our relationship with Canada.”
Artificial intelligence was also posed as a threat to employment, with 61% believing that it will lead to less jobs in Michigan. While a majority of every age group shared this belief, voters under 40 and over 65 years old were the most pessimistic. 
“Among those voters that are currently using artificial intelligence, 20.4% believe it means more jobs while 57.4% say it means less jobs,” the poll continued. 
While the poll focused on economics, one question centered on politics — whether or not voters would be open to an independent candidate for governor in 2026. Two-thirds of voters indicated that they would be interested on some level — including a majority of those who identified themselves as Strong Democrat or Strong Republican. 
“As we look at these numbers, there’s a pathway to an independent candidacy,” Czuba said. “It’s a hard pathway, but voters are intrigued by it, and that’s kind of what we were looking at.”
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is running as an independent candidate for Michigan governor. He was endorsed by the Detroit Regional Chamber PAC in July.
His candidacy sets up a three-way race in 2026 once the major political parties select their nominees in the August primary. 
Democratic candidates include Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki and Kevin Hogan of Detroit. 
Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Portage, former Attorney General Mike Cox, former House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt, Pastor Ralph Rebandt, tax activist Karla Wagner, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, Traverse City native Evan Space and Joyce Gipson.

That’s significantly more people than the total population of most of our cities and towns, like Dickinson, Williston or Mandan, and more than the populations of Jamestown and Valley City combined.
I am writing as a volunteer for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and in partnership with the North Dakota Hospital Association and North Dakota Medical Association, and also as somebody who is providing and has provided care to dear family members and friends who have experienced the devastating effects of cancer. We share the concerns of North Dakota Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread, who spoke about this issue with significant concern earlier this month as the enhanced health care tax credits that help more people afford health insurance on the Marketplace are set to expire at the end of this year if Congress does not act to extend them. 
The loss of those enhanced premium tax credits would mean that many North Dakotans who buy their health insurance through the Marketplace would face significant premium hikes, which many will be unable to afford, leading to a loss of health care. These are not small numbers: Cost of coverage would potentially spike for many, and some could see their premiums nearly double.
These increases would hit North Dakotans across the financial spectrum, potentially landing on anybody who is not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare, or who is working at one of the nearly 50% of employers in our state that do not provide health insurance to their employees. Allowing these health care tax credits to expire would affect farmers, small business owners and service workers most especially. Twenty-seven percent of farmers, ranchers and agricultural managers buy their health insurance on the individual market, and over 90% of those workers have Marketplace insurance coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates nearly 4.2 million Americans will become uninsured if the health care tax credits are not extended.
With open enrollment starting in November, many individuals will soon be forced to make difficult and perhaps life-threatening choices between paying for a significant increase in health care coverage or going uninsured. For some, the cost increases will be so high that they won’t have a choice. Access to comprehensive health care is crucial to our health and well-being, to preventing simple coughs from turning into pneumonia and to catching life-threatening diseases like cancer as early as possible when they are most treatable.
Our federal lawmakers could protect hard-working North Dakotans from making these impossible choices about their families’ health and well-being by extending health care tax credits. Failure to act will hit the wallets here of far too many of our friends, neighbors and family members, folks who work hard to make ends meet in a tough economic climate.
Now, hard-working people across North Dakota face a much larger increase to their financial load: More than $2,500 more each year for a family of four making $65,000. Others may pay significantly more. That’s why it’s so important for Sen. Hoeven, Sen. Cramer and Rep. Fedorchak to vote to extend the health care tax credits.
Most North Dakotans don’t have unlimited financial resources and for families who have faced cancer or other medical issues, health insurance coverage is a must. Some families without known health issues may choose to drop coverage in order to afford groceries and other basic needs, but that could mean living with the consequences of not having access to affordable health care when they need it.
Without coverage, individuals could eventually end up in the emergency room for something that could have been prevented or treated early or even receive a cancer diagnosis at a late stage when treatment options are limited and health outcomes are often poorer. Both of those scenarios could lead to significant financial hardship, heartbreaking health outcomes and higher costs for everyone.
These are not choices anyone should be forced to make, especially when the solution already exists.
The extension of health care tax credits will keep North Dakotans covered, healthy and best positioned to thrive in a tough financial climate.

Cary López Alvarado, of Hawthorne, California, was nine months pregnant when she was arrested by immigration officials alongside her husband, an immigrant from Guatemala. Alvarado was held overnight but was never sent to a detention facility: After taking her into custody, Immigration and Customs Enforcement learned she was a U.S. citizen.
Immediately after her release, she began to experience sharp pains in her stomach, according to a claim she filed against the federal government. She gave birth a few days later.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Angie Rodriguez, an immigrant from Colombia, was taken into ICE custody following a routine check-in with immigration officials in July, and soon after found out she was pregnant. At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center where she was held, Rodriguez could hardly bring herself to eat the small meals that the detention facility served because of how they looked and smelled, and her only other option was buying processed food like instant noodles and chips.
Rodriguez went on to miscarry while in custody, according to a lawsuit she filed against the federal government.
Antonia Aguilar Maldonano, a mother of two from El Salvador, was arrested by ICE on her way to work and detained at the Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota for almost a month. Her youngest child is 22 months old and still nursing; he has acid reflux and an allergy to other forms of milk. The jail was not equipped to house someone who was nursing, said Gloria Contreras Edin, her lawyer: It did not have a breast pump when Aguilar Maldonado arrived, forcing her to use her hands to massage milk out until the facility was able to buy a pump.

Lawyers successfully argued for her release on bond — $10,000, paid for by members of her church — while the government makes the case that she be deported.
A Biden-era policy restricts ICE from arresting or detaining immigrants who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing, except in extreme circumstances. While President Donald Trump has not formally rescinded the policy, it’s clear from lawsuits, news reports and advocates for immigrants who are detained that it’s not being followed.
Quantifying the exact number of pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants in custody has become impossible: This March, Congress let lapse a requirement that the administration report twice a year on how many of these immigrants are being held in immigration facilities. Since the fall of 2019, Congress had required the Department of Homeland Security to publicly report the count every six months and include  “detailed justification” for every single detained immigrant who was pregnant, postpartum or nursing.
ICE did not respond to The 19th’s request for this data.
While the agency said in a statement in August that pregnant immigrants are receiving sufficient care in custody, medical professionals say the conditions in these facilities can heighten the risk for complications. Limited food can impact nutrition at a vulnerable time; access to medical appointments is spotty and often not aligned with standards of care; and pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees also face the stress of arrest and separation from their families.
The impact of arrests and detention
In 2021, following public outcry against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies, the Biden administration directed ICE not to detain pregnant, postpartum or nursing people except in “exceptional circumstances” — they are a national security threat or pose immediate harm to themselves or other people. Those who are detained are supposed to be held in facilities suited to appropriate health care. ICE-employed medical professionals are supposed to provide weekly updates on those detainees to relevant agency directors. The ICE Health Service Corps is also supposed to keep consistent records of all pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees, providing monthly updates to the organization’s leadership.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has not formally rescinded that policy, but administration officials argued in court that he had done so implicitly through a sweeping anti-immigration executive order that supercharged immigration enforcement. A federal judge refuted that argument, but on its website, ICE says the policy is “not reflective of current practice.”
“We’re seeing more pregnant women detained again after not seeing much of that, at least not in ICE detention,” said Amanda Heffernan, a longtime nurse-midwife and professor of midwifery at Seattle University.
Rebecca Cassler, an attorney at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her organization’s pro bono program has seen an increase in cases of detained pregnant, postpartum and nursing people. She says no one outside ICE really knows how many, but it’s enough to make her “very concerned.”
Though the federal government has not made public how many pregnant people have been detained, Democratic lawmakers have published multiple investigations documenting known cases.
One report, published this summer by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, identified 14 credible cases of pregnant women being mistreated in detention facilities. The report included a description of pregnant women sleeping on cell floors, one detainee being told to “just drink water” when needing medical support, and another miscarrying alone after days of bleeding.
ICE has disputed the report. “Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,” ICE said in a statement on its website.
A September 18 letter signed by 29 Democratic senators and addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem directed federal officials to clarify just how many pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding people are being detained, how many have been deported and what health care is being made available to them. DHS has not acknowledged receipt, said a spokesperson for Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who organized the letter.
“We do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing,” the senators wrote.
The Women’s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group, is seeking records from Homeland Security pertaining to pregnant, postpartum or nursing individuals who have been detained. It recently launched its own independent tracker, encouraging health providers, lawyers and family members to submit information about pregnant people who have been detained. The commission said it’s too early to provide an accurate count from its tracker.
Zain Lakhani, a lawyer and director of migrant rights and justice for the commission, said credible reports of pregnant people being detained suggest a frequency higher than ICE’s policy would suggest.
“It would be shocking that we would be able to have this level of detained pregnant people under the guidance,” she said. “We are seeing just this shocking number of detained postpartum and pregnant women.”

Workers helping integrate deported immigrants in Honduras told researchers from the Women’s Refugee Commission that nursing women who were deported had not received enough food and water to continue lactating.
“They arrive with hardly any milk — or milk that looks like water — and this affects the babies’ weight,” one worker said, according to a report published by the organization.
Medical care ‘very haphazard and spotty’
By the time Aguilar Maldonado left the jail, her breast milk had started to dry up, Contreras Edin said. She is particularly worried about the impact of detention on her children, who were not with her and now follow her wherever she goes, including to the bathroom. Her boyfriend has been deported; she is asking a judge to let her leave voluntarily — a process that has fewer legal penalties than being deported — so she and her children can follow him.
“Her children were traumatized and her youngest was especially traumatized,” Contreras Edin said. “That bond was broken during detention and that left a permanent impression on her children.”
There is no way to ethically research how detention specifically may affect pregnancy outcomes, including whether it could increase the possibility of miscarriage, said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who studies the reproductive health of incarcerated women. But evidence does show that physical and psychological strain — the kind people can suffer while detained — threatens the health of a pregnancy and can mean greater risk of preterm birth.
“I’m very concerned because of the conditions we’ve already heard about that could be increasing the risks of adverse outcomes,” Sufrin said. “I’m very concerned about the outcomes for these moms as well as for the outcomes for their babies.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the conditions or available accommodations for pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants.
Alvarado, who is seeking $1 million following her arrest, citing “the unconstitutional conduct, unlawful arrest, and the tortious conduct of Border Patrol and ICE agents,” said her daughter is healthy and growing. But she’s still dealing with the aftermath of her detention.
Footage of the arrest shows federal agents holding her hands behind her — despite guidance advising that officers generally not use physical restraints on pregnant people and that, if they do, they should keep a pregnant person’s hands in front.
Her husband has now been deported, and Alvarado has no income. She’s watching her savings dwindle and relying on her family to help care for her little girl. She said she was unsure if she’d have to pick up multiple jobs to make ends meet — and if so, who would be able to care for her infant. She remembers the terror she felt while in government custody.
“Every time I see a news or video, it does rewind in my head,” she said. “It does get me very emotional, seeing stuff like that.”
Victoria Petty, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who is representing Rodriguez — the woman who suffered a miscarriage in detention — said that she first connected with her client’s husband in late August, about a month after his wife’s detention.
He had left Petty a voicemail and text explaining that his wife was pregnant in a detention center and that he was really worried about her. Days later, he called again. “He’s crying on the other line, and he’s like, ‘She had a miscarriage. I don’t know what to do. She’s in the hospital. Help,’” Petty recalled.

Rodriguez described in court records being “unignorably hungry” inside the Bakersfield, California, detention facility and lacking prenatal health care and education for weeks after her pregnancy was confirmed. Eventually, she began to see brown discharge and was taken to an off-site hospital where, days later, health care providers confirmed she had miscarried.
Petty moved quickly to file a lawsuit claiming unconstitutional detention. Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.
“It was very scary. She was in pain. So after this really traumatic experience, and her going to the hospital and confirming that they did not see the fetus on the ultrasound — after all of that, they brought her back to the detention center and put her in medical isolation,” Petty said, adding that her client was distraught.
Petty said it’s hard to determine whether detention conditions caused or contributed to Rodriguez’ miscarriage, a very wanted first pregnancy. But, she said, it’s important to consider the stress of being suddenly detained in a van — her client is from Colombia; kidnappings and murders have left lasting scars on the Latin American nation — along with the strain and lack of food options in detention.
“These are the conditions that she was in when she was pregnant. And we cannot rule out that having been under that level of stress and fear and having that little care contributed to her pregnancy loss,” Petty said.
Heffernan, who has worked with several immigrants who were detained while pregnant, said she has seen pregnant immigrants get a few small accommodations: being placed in a lower bunk instead of the top bunk for sleep or getting extra milk with their meals and sometimes an extra sandwich or snack before bedtime.
Medical care, she said, can be “very haphazard and spotty,” with prenatal appointments often not happening on schedule.
“You do see people getting a prenatal visit here and there, but not in a timely fashion, and not according to the standard of care for people that are outside,” Heffernan said. “For instance, in a couple of people that I’ve been in contact with recently, one had been in detention for several months and had had no prenatal care at all. Another had had one visit.”
Pregnant immigrants are also more vulnerable to more severe cases of COVID-19, flu and other illnesses, which spread quickly in crowded places like detention centers.
There is an extensive list of best practices for detained pregnant and postpartum people, Sufrin said, including but not limited to regular access to comprehensive physical and mental health care, nutrition, the ability to exercise and adequate housing.
But from a medical standpoint, she said, “The best practices would be not to detain them.”

Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio House Republicans are set to introduce legislation that would allow stores and breweries to sell THC-infused drinks, but prohibit all other forms of “intoxicating hemp” products.
Also in the proposal, exclusively shared with WEWS, cities would get their long-awaited tax revenue from marijuana dispensary sales. This comes as a court blocked Gov. Mike DeWine’s hemp ban.
Years of negotiating on marijuana and hemp policy — with nothing to show for it.
After nearly two years, DeWine took matters into his own hands last week, signing an executive order temporarily banning what he calls “intoxicating hemp,” low-level THC that can be bought at gas stations and smoke shops. It can look like regular candy and has no age requirement to buy it.
“Frankly, the legislature had not taken action,” DeWine said.
On Oct. 14, a judge temporarily blocked it.
“I’m still hopeful that the legislature will come in and actually take action,” DeWine said.


Each legislative leader agreed that kids should not have access to THC.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, pointed to the different opinions on how marijuana and hemp should be regulated when asked why garnering caucus agreement was so difficult.
“There are three groups: the folks who believe that marijuana should be legalized and regulated… There are other folks who believe that the hemp products should be on equal standing with everything that happened in the initiated statute…,” Huffman said. “And then you have folks, like me, who are prohibitionists, who don’t think it should be legalized at all and it should be rare. I would say the prohibitionists have largely lost this discussion.”
The speaker has been trying to wrangle 64 other House Republicans to agree on THC regulations. Finally, a deal was crafted between the two chambers this summer, but the Senate pulled out at the last minute.
Now, the House is ready to try again.
“It’s going to be a very thoughtful and targeted bill,” said state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, in an exclusive interview on Friday.

Callender is the resident marijuana expert in the House. In an amendment to Senate Bill 56, which would wipe the vast majority of the existing legislation, the new policy allows stores and breweries to sell THC drinks and regulates the advertisements so they don’t appeal to kids.
“It will have a pretty complete ban other than the beverages, but it’s a temporary ban while some rules are being able to be developed, so that will give more time,” Callender said, adding this isn’t necessarily the final draft. “But in the meantime, it will take the high THC content stuff off the shelves, at least temporarily.”
The bill will deal with more than just hemp.
“On the marijuana side, making sure the tax dollars get to the local governments the way we had promised, the way the voters had promised, and the way local governments had expected,” Callender said.
Right now, cities with dispensaries aren’t getting tax revenue from sales. The House has been trying to get them their money, but Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) wants to change where the money goes.
“The Senate’s already spoken,” McColley said. “It’s really, at this point, we just got to see what the House is willing to do.”
The Senate pulled out of the summer agreement, in part, due to the debate on taxes.
Asked why a bill exclusively talking about hemp couldn’t be introduced without concepts deemed controversial by the Senate, Callendar said that’s not off the table.
“Well, I think we may still end up going there if we have to,” he said. “If we put it all together, it may be harder for the Senate to say no to some of the marijuana things that we feel strongly about.”
Lawmakers planned to introduce the amended bill this week, and the lawmaker hopes to send it over to the Senate on Wednesday.
“They can either accept it or not accept it,” Callender said. “If they don’t, it’ll go to conference committee, and it will force the chambers to work the issues out.”
The Senate’s leading marijuana expert, state Sen. Steve Huffman (R-Tipp City), said the House wasn’t sharing the legislation with them until this week.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Because of the ongoing federal government shutdown, Mainers who rely on the nation’s largest anti-hunger program won’t receive benefits next month. 
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service notified every state that November funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, won’t be issued at this time. This comes after the department received notice earlier this month that this was a possibility. 
More than one in 10 Mainers throughout the state rely on these benefits, but the need is markedly higher in Androscoggin, Aroostook, Piscataquis, Somerset and Washington counties. In total, just shy of 170,000 Mainers receive SNAP benefits. They are among the more than 42 million Americans across the country who rely on the program. 
SNAP benefits on pace to run out in two weeks if shutdown persists

“For tens of thousands of Maine people, these benefits mean the ability to put food on the table,” said DHHS Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. “A disruption of this scale will also impact Maine’s food pantries, which are vital partners in helping communities meet basic needs, as well as retailers.”
Last Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if Congress fails to strike a deal and end the government shutdown.
On average, a family of four in Maine who receives SNAP benefits gets $572 per month. Three-quarters of Maine’s SNAP households include at least one working adult and more than half include a person with a disability. More than one-third of those households have children.
November SNAP benefits can’t be issued until the shutdown ends or there is new federal guidance, the department said. However, benefits already loaded onto EBT cards can still be used to buy food. 
The department said it will continue to process applications, renewals and other updates during the shutdown. Additionally, when the shutdown ends, the department said there will be more information about the future of federal SNAP benefits. 
SNAP recipients can sign up for electronic updates through the My Maine Connection portal for state benefits.

Mississippi Today Ideas publishes guest essays on the issues impacting the state.

On April 6th, 2015, I discovered my son, Jeffrey, non-responsive in his living room. I called 911 then performed CPR until paramedics arrived. Two hours later, the emergency room doctor confirmed our greatest fear. He was 24 years old and the cause of death was a heroin/fentanyl overdose.
I frequently speak in recovery centers as a father who witnessed his son struggle through a decade of opioid addiction that began in junior high.
In my son, I saw the shame he felt as a result of his addiction and the actions he felt he had to take to keep the dope sickness at bay. The impact of Jeffrey’s addiction on our family was significant then, and it continues to this day.
The safeguards in place to protect Americans from faulty products failed Jeffrey and our family. Addictive opioids were irresponsibly manufactured and distributed years after those profiting knew their actions were costing American lives and destroying families.
I was pleased to learn of the national opioid settlements directing those companies that practiced business unscrupulously to pay into a fund to be used to remediate some of the harms. I was saddened to learn over $63 million of those funds would be directed to Mississippi cities and counties with absolutely no stipulation that they be spent to remediate the opioid epidemic. These local governments are free to patch potholes with these funds if they so choose.
Graphic by Bethany Atkinson
The good news is that as of now, most funds remain unspent, and there’s time to hold decision makers accountable on how they’re spent. The bad news is that hundreds more Mississippians have fallen victim to the opioid epidemic as those funds sat idle in city and county bank accounts.
At Mayor Toby Barker’s request, I formed a citizens advisory group to offer the city of Hattiesburg guidance on how to invest our funds. The committee included a university dean, the director of two area drug rehabilitation centers, a local harm reduction advocate, our local city homeless coordinator, directors of local sober living homes, people in recovery and surviving family members, like myself, who have lost loved ones to overdose.
We agreed on the following six strategies that we believe would best remediate the harms of the opioid epidemic.
Greater public access to no-cost naloxone (Narcan) is the number one reason for the recent decline in overdose death rates. We suggested our city provide overdose reversal kits anywhere they currently provide an automatic external defibrillator. We also asked that events be held where naloxone is distributed to the public along with overdose reversal training. 
The gold standard in treating opioid addiction is the use of medicated assisted treatment drugs (MAT). These drugs help manage cravings, increasing the chance of obtaining long term recovery. Making MAT available in local jails reduces the chance of overdose following discharge and reduces recidivism. We recommended the city explore using the employee clinic as a point of distribution of MAT and that they encourage the local jail to adopt MAT.
The chances of recovering from opioid addiction are increased if a person can move directly into a sober living environment following their treatment stay. If a tree surgeon removes a dying tree from the forest and nurses it back to health in a greenhouse then returns it to the same place where it acquired the disease, the tree’s chances of recovering are slim.
Sober living homes are few in number and the cost of moving into one often exceeds the resources of the person new to sobriety. We suggested the city consider making any vacant housing properties in their possession available to nonprofits experienced in operating sober living homes. We also suggested the city consider paying the move-in deposit and first month’s rent for city residents needing a sober living environment.
The Oxford House model is a worldwide sober living concept where residential homes are rented and shared by as many as eight individuals who split expenses making the arrangement cost effective while holding each other accountable in their personal recovery.
Lack of transportation is another obstacle to long-term recovery. By offering transit passes, the city could help those in recovery find and keep jobs and make the recovery meetings they need to attend. Funds also could be used to transport a resident to a recovery center and to return them home when they complete their stay.
We suggested the city look at ways to remove other small but significant obstacles to recovery, such as assisting those needing a driving license reinstated or obtaining a state-issued ID.
We asked the city to consider removing the “felony conviction” box from their job applications. This box of shame is enough to keep some otherwise well qualified applicants from applying for employment.
Lastly, we requested the city consider constructing a memorial to commemorate the lives of all our residents lost to overdose. It would allow grieving family members to gather to remember those lost and in doing so eradicate the unfair stigma of this disease.
What our group did not ask for was any financial consideration to us personally to compensate us for our pain and suffering. And I’ve yet to hear of any talks of such a settlement being directed at surviving family members.
The only thing we want to see from this settlement is for your family not to endure the losses we’ve endured.
Many elected officials will be tempted to look at these funds as a windfall and will spend them with little regard for the suffering and loss that created this opportunity. I encourage you to visit your city council and board of supervisors and implore them to do the right thing. 
Form your own local advisory group, or simply take the suggestions our group has provided for you and offer them to your elected leaders.
Rather than patching potholes, let’s insist on building pathways to recovery.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday filed an appeal of a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge’s decision to require that state election officials conduct an intensive search for registered voters who aren’t citizens. 
Judge Michael Maxwell’s Oct. 6 ruling required that the Wisconsin Elections Commission cross reference its voter registration list against the state Department of Transportation’s records to determine people’s citizenship status when they applied for a driver’s license or state ID. He also ordered that WEC and local election clerks stop accepting new voter registrations without obtaining proof of citizenship — though that portion of the ruling was put on hold pending the appeal. 
Under current law, people registering to vote must affirm they are U.S. citizens but are not required to provide proof. However, lying about citizenship status while registering to vote is a crime. 
Fears of non-citizen voting have frequently been raised by Republicans in recent years who, since 2020, have expressed  skepticism of election administration. The initial Waukesha County lawsuit was brought by a pair of right-wing election conspiracy theorists. 
While claims of non-citizen voting revolve around the threat that the issue could swing an election result and occasionally cases are found and prosecuted, there is no evidence that non-citizens vote in substantial enough numbers to influence election results in Wisconsin or anywhere across the country. 
In the appeal, filed in the Madison-based District IV, the DOJ argued that the ruling “reshapes Wisconsin election law” while leaving many details vague and potentially violating other laws. 
“The circuit court’s decision and order drastically alters voter registration and elections in Wisconsin, violates state law, and threatens voting rights,” the appeal states.
Lead by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, the filing states that Maxwell’s requirement to match data with Department of Transportation records would be based on data that’s up to eight years old, which could result in the disenfranchisement of people who were legal residents when they applied for their driver’s license but have since become citizens with the right to vote. 
The appeal also argues that Maxwell’s ruling orders local election officials to change their practices even though they weren’t a party to the lawsuit and does not outline what “proof of citizenship” election officials should use to register people to vote. 
“The court issued this sweeping relief despite no evidence of injury to Respondents: they speculated about the risk of vote dilution by illegal voters, but provided no evidence that a noncitizen had voted or registered to vote in Wisconsin,” the appeal states.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The Cumberland County Board of Commissioners initially voted to continue immigration detentions for federal authorities at Maine’s largest jail on Monday night, however at the eleventh hour the board decided to reconsider the issue and take it up again next month. 
The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
However, the majority of the board, 3-2, argued on Monday that changing the contract would not actually stop the jail from housing immigration detainees, only transfer the financial burden. Further, if policy could ultimately change so immigration detainees were no longer housed in Maine, some board members also raised concern that that would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel.
That latter point is what has led some immigration advocates to take a more nuanced position on this issue, or refrain from taking a position at all, and instead put their efforts behind ending local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 
The money
Explaining that even without a contract, the jail would still have to house federal detainees, several of the commissioners and Sheriff Kevin Joyce pointed to Maine law that stipulates “county jails shall receive and safely keep all prisoners committed under authority of the United States until discharged.”
Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.
“I will continue to hold ICE inmates until the law is changed or a court decides it’s unconstitutional and tells me otherwise,” Joyce said. 
Stephen Gorden, who represents District 3, said county commissioners do not have the authority to prevent ICE from housing detainees in the county’s jail and that ending the contract “would simply transfer the financial burden from the federal government to the county taxpayer.”
Ending the contract could result in a loss of more than $2 million in jail operating costs, according to Gorden and Jean-Marie Caterina, commissioner for District 1, who voted to remove immigration detentions from the contract. 
Maine’s largest jail faces mounting pressure to end contract with federal immigration authorities

She asked attendees to contact their legislators to push for the state to provide higher compensation for jails to account for that potential loss. 
“Sadly, while the federal government compensates $150 per day, the state only compensates us approximately $25 a day,” Caterina said. 
Like many across the U.S., jails in Maine have concerns about being under-resourced. Joyce has previously said that the U.S. Marshal Service contract is a crucial part of Cumberland County Jail’s funding model. 
The other commissioner who voted to change the contract, Patricia Smith of District 4, said,  “Will this really solve the problem? Probably not, but I’m all about a first step.” 
Inherent challenges with immigration detention 
As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.
Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
Jim Cloutier, commissioner for District 5, and Tom Tyler, who represents District 2, argued on Monday that if the county were to stop housing immigration detainees, the change would exacerbate that challenge. 
As each of the commissioners took time to explain their stances, the chants of “cancel the contract” grew louder and louder outside.
“What you have advocated for tonight would do grave harm to a lot of people,” Cloutier said over the chants. “You may hate ICE, and I certainly do. I blame their management. They are poorly managed and the tactics are inconsistent with American law, but the people in the jail need as much help as we can arrange.”
In January, University of Maine Law School in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project started a project to provide limited consultations for ICE detainees at Cumberland County Jail. 
Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, which advocates for improving the legal, social and economic conditions for immigrants in Maine, spoke neither for nor against changing the contract on Monday. 
Maine Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, the only state-wide immigration legal services organization, has taken a nuanced stance on the issue, previously telling Maine Morning Star  that the organization doesn’t believe immigration detention should exist, but if it does, the group is in favor of people being held as close to their support systems as possible. 
Cloutier made the motion to reconsider the vote and table it until the board meets next, Nov. 17.

SPP plans for how the reliability of the energy grid, making projections about energy usage. (Submitted: Southwest Power Pool)TOPEKA — Experts at the Southwest Power Pool project energy usage to grow by 96% during the next decade in its 14-state region, and on Friday, federal regulators gave the organization the ability to proactively plan for that growth. 
SPP watches the weather, human behavior, energy usage, the growth of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency along with numerous other factors to determine energy usage in its 14-state region. Lacking a crystal ball, the organization focuses on data. 
“Predictions are difficult,” said Casey Cathey, SPP vice president of engineering. “I’ve worked in the industry just over two decades and when I first started, we were excited by 1% load growth year over year. The latest load forecast and demand forecasts we’re seeing 10 years out are over 75% (load increase) at peak levels.”
SPP is a regional transmission organization, one of seven approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as nonprofit member agencies that oversee transmission infrastructure, ensure utility system reliability and manage the wholesale electricity market.
FERC on Friday ruled that SPP could change its processes when considering new generation resources. 
In a letter to FERC, SPP noted that the way previous rules were written, a transmission customer must demonstrate that it has resources to serve the customer’s existing load plus the load request to be added. 
The ruling now allows SPP to consider new resources that may come online even if transmission customers currently lack the resources to serve their forecasted load. Such a move will allow SPP and its members to plan for the projected load increases.
Growth in data centers and artificial intelligence receives most of the attention for spiking energy usage, and AI-driven data centers are about 40% of the load addition expected at SPP, Cathey said.
But in the SPP region, organic growth that includes residential and small commercial and industrial businesses is increasing, Cathey said, and factors such as increasing extreme weather events are part of the equation. 
The SPP team tracks every factor that might affect electricity usage. For instance, the oil and gas industry is focusing on electrification, the process of replacing combustion engines with electric and reducing the use of fossil fuels. 
“Our footprint has two major oil basins, the Bakken Oil basin in the Dakotas and the Permian Basin,” Cathey said. “Even if nothing else — the Panasonic battery (plant) or crypto — you’re still talking about a good 20% increase just in electrifying those pump jacks.”
Every industry change affecting utility use must be considered, he said. The organization relies on its 65 load-responsible member utilities – primarily Evergy in Kansas –  to share data. 
A real-time prediction engine, which sounds a little like a Marty McFly invention, helps SPP understand human behavior and its effects on electricity use, such as when people wake up and turn on coffee pots, Cathey said.
Weather matters too.
“Recently, we expanded our weather model down to 1980 so we have at least 45 years of weather data,” Cathey said. 
Out of the last five winter seasons, four had extreme weather conditions, more than seen in the past 15 years, he said.
“Climate change is real, and it’s not just affecting the warmth of the Earth but it’s also changing the overall weather patterns,” he said.
It’s a balance, though. Overpredicting the effects of climate change will directly impact affordability if a signal is sent to build more power plants than needed, Cathey said.  
As SPP considers energy use from all perspectives, it plans for a “cushion,” Cathey said. Machines break, for instance, so planning for system reliability means incorporating resource diversity. The organization has established a winter planning reserve margin, he said.  
 “We’ve seen in the last few winters that we need more dispatchable resources,” he said. “(We’re) trying to be technology agnostic. We’re trying to send the signal for batteries as well as wind to complement gas during these winter extreme conditions.”
Dispatchable resources are those that can be ramped up as needed, such as natural gas. 
The planning reserve margin operates like coaches building bench strength in a case star player gets hurt, Cathey said. 
“But there’s a balance where you can’t have too much bench strength, where you’re paying all these people to just sit on the bench,” he said. 
In recent years, the SPP has seen a change in its fuel mix and fuel sources projected to connect to the system, Cathey said
“We saw a major uptick in thermal, which is all gas resources, from roughly about three gigs to over 30 gigs — so 10 times more gas is looking to connect in our footprint,” he said. “We still see a very large amount of wind, solar and electric storage resources, batteries, primarily.
“No one’s building coal moving forward,” Cathey added. “Coal is, at least in my mind, really good for now until we have a suitable replacement, and then we can continue to see retirements of coal.”
New generation sources take a long time to build and Cathey said that creates challenges. 
“One of the challenges we have is we need to go ahead and make these decisions now with, quite frankly, not 100% assurance that we’re right,” he said. 
It’s exactly that uncertainty that worries Andrew French, chairman of the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities and determines who will pay for needed system expansions. 
In a recent hearing in which the commission pre-approved Evergy’s request to build two natural gas plants and a solar farm to the tune of $1.8 billion, French said he had “complex and competing impressions” of the case and its magnitude. 
“We get a lot of very big and impactful cases, but this one was particularly impactful from a customer affordability and customer reliability standpoint,” he said. “Probably the element that caused me the most consternation or frustration is just the uncertainty of the future. You are looking at a range of many different possible futures, and it’s difficult to know what the right choice is at any given point in time.”
While KCC commissioners supported Evergy’s request, French said natural gas plants come with high costs and exposure to unregulated and potentially volatile fuel markets.
French highlighted improvements to the integrated resource planning process, which is basically a guide to projecting resource needs and determining how those will be met. He said the changes will help Evergy consider an even wider range of resources than the company has in previous plans.  
He encouraged Evergy to think “flexibly” about things like energy storage and options to mitigate risks for customers. 
“The next few years will be extremely important for our electric utilities to think strategically and work with regulators to position customers in the state advantageously for the coming years,” French said. “We need to be ready to seize on economic development opportunities while also being thoughtful and mitigating risks to affordability and reliability. It’s a very challenging time to make those resource decisions, but that’s what Kansans should expect of their utilities.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SPP-Corporate-Office-3-1024x581.png,,,2025-10-21 10:17:05.247104

The groups, led by the state education department’s former finance chief Kari Monsees, have convened three times each. They are scheduled to meet three additional times prior to presenting recommendations to the larger task force in December.
Proposed changes are due to Gov. Mike Kehoe by December 2026. Here is where the policy discussions are heading. 
 Funding targets

The funding efforts working group is primarily focused on a measure called the state adequacy target, which is intended to represent the per-pupil cost for districts to provide an adequate education.
Currently, this number is calculated by looking at the per-pupil expenditures of “performance districts,” or districts who score at least 90% of the points possible on the state’s performance review, called the Missouri School Improvement Program.
The group is not considering a dramatic shift away from this system but is instead moving toward a new way of classifying performance districts. The proposal discussed Monday would look at districts’ expenditures that score in the top 100 of the Missouri School Improvement Program.
Additionally, the calculation would be based on the districts’ enrollment numbers rather than attendance and would include extra weighting for students with disabilities, low-income students and English-language learners.
This method would be less volatile with changes to MSIP, which is on its sixth iteration since its inception in 1991, since the number of districts setting the average would remain steady.
During the switch from MSIP5 to MSIP6, a system deemed “more rigorous” by education officials, the number of performance districts dropped from over 200 to 23. The state adequacy target then rose from $6,375 to $7,145.
The shift added an extra $300 million to fully fund the foundation formula in fiscal year 2026. In his budget request in January, Kehoe excluded the $300 million, though lawmakers decided after tense negotiations to fully fund the formula with the new boost.
Kehoe, in his executive order creating the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, asked for the group to create a formula that would provide fiscal year 2025 funding levels — prior to the $300 million boost.
But the change discussed Monday is not a cost-saving measure. Monsees estimated the proposal would drive the target to $10,367.
“If we are going to increase this side of the equation significantly, I just want to (ask) what that means for the rest of the equation,” said Don Thalhuber, policy director for the Senate Democratic caucus who helped draft the state’s current formula in 2005. “Because we don’t have infinite money.”
A deduction in the formula is likely to balance out the adequacy target’s surge, Monsees said, pointing to a factor that subtracts local funding to lower the amount due to wealthier districts.
“The local effort is tied back to 2004’s assessed values that is very much deflated as well,” he said. “So the state adequacy target is likely to go up, but then at the same time, your local effort is going to go up.”
 Local effort

Missouri’s formula considers local funding as a counterbalance to state aid, meaning that wealthier districts with adequate tax revenue receive less on a per-pupil basis. Finding a way to subtract local effort as part of the formula is a “conundrum,” Monsees told the group last week.
The local effort working group pointed to problems with two main models, one based on property taxes and the other on local wealth.
“We come up with these proxies that somehow represent what the capacity of a local community is to generate funds for their school, and the state’s obviously going to try to balance that across communities. But if that representation doesn’t match the actual cash that comes in in revenue, we may not be balancing the scales as much as we would want to,” Monsees said.
The group has been critical of the current formula’s reliance on property tax revenue. And with lawmakers considering changes to the property tax system, the factor feels unsteady.
“We have got something that may not be equitable and may not be stable,” said Monsees.
He suggested the group look for two to four factors so they are not reliant on just one variable, and they adjourned their discussion Wednesday without direction otherwise.
 Student counts

A working group looking at the way students are counted in the formula is debating a shift to enrollment-based funding rather than basing state aid on a district’s average attendance.
Enrollment-based funding is not a new concept in Missouri. A 2023 study commissioned by the State Board of Education recommended a switch away from attendance funding, saying attendance-based models disadvantage higher poverty districts.
And in 2024, state lawmakers passed a large education package that included a gradual shift to funding 50% based on attendance and 50% based on enrollment by 2029.
Two other studies that the foundation formula task force has delved into also recommend enrollment-based student counts.
But with state lawmakers having recently negotiated the shift to a 50/50 approach, Monsees told the group that basing the formula purely on enrollment could be “not as easy of a switch politically.”
“There is still a little bit of hesitation there to remove the financial incentive that comes with including attendance,” he said.
The group is also evaluating how different student groups pull more state money and seems likely to eliminate funding cliffs that are written into the current formula.
Low-income students, those with special education services and English-language learners have an extra multiplier in the formula, giving their districts more money to provide services. But there is a threshold built in, assuming a base level of students with various needs. Only those with a higher percentage of students in these groups pull the extra funds currently.
The student counts working group has been pursuing a plan to eliminate the threshold.
“This idea of removing the thresholds and weighting all the students, it is certainly going to be a cost driver to the overall equation,” Monsees told the group.
The discussion Monday dug into the weights with more specificity, with the group considering a multi-tiered system for special education funding.
Monsees gave options of grouping types of disabilities into funding subcategories or creating a tiered system based on the amount of time a student spends out of the general education classroom. The group members preferred the latter.
Jordan Dickey, assistant superintendent of finance for Joplin Schools, said that kids with the same disabilities may not have the same support needs.
“Depending on what their label is, it doesn’t necessarily reflect the level of service that they need,” she said.
She recommended a much greater weight for students who receive educational time out of the general education classroom.
 Performance incentives

Kehoe’s executive order includes a charge to give districts with strong performance bonus funding. Performance incentives would be new in Missouri and are largely unprecedented, other than a model in Tennessee that awards schools when students reach certain targets.
The group studying performance incentives does not have a definitive plan, as of the conclusion of its third meeting last week, but is leaning toward promoting literacy and numeracy.
Mike Podgursky, a semi-retired economics professor from the University of Missouri-Columbia and affiliated scholar at the Sinquefield Center for Applied Economic Research, suggested the group pick one or two priorities rather than giving money for “a whole bunch of things.”
“There’s a case for really focusing on early literacy,” he said. “If these kids can’t read by grades three and four, then you forget about math at grade eight and everything else.”
The group discussed incentives for literacy at the third grade level and math performance in eighth grade at length.
Members are considering building the rewards into the formula or siloing them as a separate source of funding.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_monsees1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-21 09:56:58.371876

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Before Alaska’s largest city was founded, there were well-established small communities in the area.
Now the municipality of Anchorage has received a $500,000 grant from the U.S. National Park Service for historic preservation, tourism development and economic revitalization in three distinctive communities within its sprawling borders: The Dena’ina village of Eklutna, which has several centuries of history, and the communities of Girdwood and Indian, which have histories of mining.
The money is from a program called the Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization Grant Program, administered by the Park Service. The program promotes rural economic development through the preservation and restoration of historic buildings.
With money from the grant, announced Oct. 14, municipal officials will make awards for projects that fit the program’s purpose, said Michelle Nelson, Anchorage’s director of grant development.
“Our focus is on finding those sites that support job growth and heritage tourism,” Nelson said.
At first glance, Anchorage – home to 4 out of 10 Alaskans – would not seem to qualify for a rural development program, she said. “I knew going into it that we were ineligible just looking at the map,” she said.
But municipal officials were able to convince the Park Service that the three outlying communities – each located at least 25 miles from the downtown core, each with fewer than 3,000 residents and each with distinctive histories and characteristics – qualify for the rural grant, she said.
A key part of the message was explaining the municipality’s vast size, which sprawls over forested areas, mountains and glaciers as well as the heavily populated Anchorage Bowl. At nearly 2,000 square miles, Anchorage is the nation’s fourth-largest municipality by geography, after the boroughs of Juneau, Sitka and Wrangell.

	The program is expected to run over three to four years, Nelson said.
The first year will be devoted to developing the program, preparatory work, which will include establishing guidelines and educating and outreach potential recipients, she said.
In the second year, the municipality expects to select two projects for grant awards, she said. The year after, another three to five projects are expected to be selected for grant awards, she said.
The selection process will be guided by experts from the Anchorage Community Development Authority, the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, Museums Alaska and Preservation Alaska, she said.
Eklutna has the distinction of having the only federally recognized tribal government within Anchorage municipal borders. Girdwood, site of the Alyeska ski resort and the year-round tourism centered at that site, was originally a support community for a gold rush that brought thousands of miners to Turnagain Arm during the 1890s. It was initially called Glacier City but was renamed after a local prospector who discovered gold. Indian was also established as a mining settlement. Indian’s history is linked to a quartz mine that operated in the early 20th century.
Nelson said projects need not be in Eklutna, Girdwood or Indian to qualify for awards. But they must meet the qualifications like those in the three communities, including distance of at least 25 miles from downtown Anchorage and eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, she said.
In Eklutna, there is already some restoration work underway. The St. Nicholas Church, a Russian Orthodox church built in the 1870s, is the subject of a three-year project funded by the Park Service. The church is the oldest building in the municipality.
There could be some urgency to other, yet-to-be-funded projects.
For example, at Indian Valley Mine, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Nelson and other municipal officials noticed that a blacksmith’s house that was also listed was nowhere to be found.
“It’s not there anymore. Because by the time the property owner acquired the site, it had already been reduced to rubble,” she said.
“Making sure that those sites can stay preserved is just so hard to do in Alaska because of the elements. And if we don’t get resources to those areas, then we can continue to see sites disappear,” she said.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryThe Democratic National Committee announced a six-figure investment into Virginia’s democratic campaigns on Tuesday, meant to support additional field staff to help with door-knocking and distributing mailers and campaign literature. The new investment comes as the state’s executive branch and House of Delegates campaigns ramp up in the final weeks of the election and follows the DNC’s previous $3 million investment in Virginia. 
While Virginia and New Jersey have drawn the focus of both parties this year as politically purple states with gubernatorial elections, the DNC announced earlier this year that it will continue to boost all state chapters of the party to support candidates up and down ballots from local to state to national. 
“The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in an April press call. 
With Virginia among the top three states with the largest concentration of federal workers, Democrats have reminded voters that President Donald Trump’s administration has made many cuts to such positions and pointed out the potential negative impacts on the state’s economy.

“As voters start heading to the polls, the DNC is ensuring Virginians know the stakes of this election,” Martin wrote in a press release announcing the new investments. 
Republicans are also accelerating their efforts as the final stretches of the election unfold. The Republican Governors Association recently supplied Virginia with an additional $1.5 million for advertising to capitalize on Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones’ text messages from 2022 that contained violent rhetoric about a former GOP Virginia lawmaker and his family. 
The texts have been widely denounced on both sides of the aisle but Republicans have called on Jones to drop out of the race while Democrats have stopped short of doing so (the revelation of the three-year-old texts came well after early voting had been underway). 
With all 140 House of Delegates seats up for election this fall along with the roles of governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, Democrats are hoping to retain their majority in the House and take back the executive branch.
Democratic majorities will matter in advancing in-progress constitutional amendments next year so that voters statewide can formally weigh in. The proposals to enshrine same-sex marriage rights and to restore voting rights to ex-felons who’ve completed their sentences advanced this year with narrow bipartisan support, while an effort to cement reproductive rights met pushback from most Republicans only advanced because Democrats control the House and state Senate. 
National issues are also shaping Virginia candidates’ races. 
While both parties have emphasized addressing concerns about the cost of living and economics, Democrats  — particularly Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger — are also focusing on the Trump administration’s role in those issues. Spanberger and other Democrats have heaped scrutiny on new tariffs, job layoffs and forthcoming health care changes Congress passed this summer at Trump’s urging.
Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears has touched on these issues but much of her campaign’s focus has been on opposing local or state policies that have allowed transgender students and athletes to participate in sports teams and use  bathrooms aligning with their gender identity. 
The Mercury also has detailed policy breakdowns for both Spanberger and Earle-Sears, one of whom will become governor and sign off on future state budgets along with numerous laws that the legislature advances. 
“With this investment to turbocharge on-the-ground GOTV efforts across the Commonwealth, Democrats are preparing  to win big up and down the ballot,” Martin said.

(Austin Anthony for The Kentucky Lantern)Jefferson County Republicans have nominated their pick for an open seat in the Kentucky Senate. 
The party’s executive committee team selected Calvin Leach as the GOP nominee for a special election in the 37th Senate District. A special election is underway for the seat left vacant by former Kentucky Senate Democratic Whip David Yates, who was recently appointed by Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg to serve an unexpired term as Jefferson County clerk. 
In a Tuesday press release, the Jefferson County Republican Party said Leach is a resident of the South End in Louisville and a graduate of Pleasure Ridge Park High School. He studied at the University of Louisville, ultimately earning a masters degree in political science. He retired from the U.S. Army in February. 
Leach’s work experience also includes positions at Electrolux, UPS, JustFab and Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. He has also been a legislative assistant with Louisville Metro Council and interned with Kentucky Refugee Ministries while in graduate school. 
Don Fitzpatrick, the chair of the Jefferson County Republican Party, backed Leach in a statement. 
“Calvin is an outstanding choice to represent the Louisville GOP in this election,” Fitzpatrick said. “Having recently retired from the U.S. Army, Calvin is patriotic, community-oriented and disciplined. Calvin is well aware of the challenges and opportunities in Senate District 37 and we look forward to actively supporting his candidacy.”
Louisville Democrats announced their candidate Monday — Gary Clemons, the president of the Steelworkers Local 1693. 
Michon Lindstrom, a spokesperson for the Kentucky secretary of state’s office, previously told the Kentucky Lantern the deadline for candidates to file for the special election is Tuesday, Oct. 21. The election will be held Tuesday, Dec. 16. 
The deadline for voters in the Senate district to register and be eligible to vote in the election is Monday, Nov. 17. The district includes western parts of Jefferson County.
With Yates’ departure, Democrats hold five seats in the state Senate to Republicans’ 32 members.

Her designs for jingle dresses, ribbon skirts, jackets, appliques and other items reflect a modern take on historical woodland motifs and designs using elements such as shimmering floral  jacquard satin and colorful velveteen. Her items are authentically Anishinaabe and made for the Anishinaabe people.
The last few months, however, Crane’s business has hit a bump in the road as the Trump administration tariffs kicked in, sometimes doubling the price of materials she uses for her work and increasing the costs for shipping. 
She’s had to increase prices more than 10 percent on some items to accommodate her increased production costs.
“I had a rough summer,  financially, because with those kinds of prices there’s even fewer people that can afford them,” said Crane, Naongashiing First Nation Ojibwe. “I do understand that I do charge more than a lot of other people, and I do feel bad, but there’s nothing that I can do. I’ve got to keep my lights on, too.”

The tariffs are impacting other artisans and businesses in Indian Country, as well. The majority of items that go into making regalia – jingle cones, beads, wool, fabric and store-bought leather – are largely imported from overseas. So when tariffs are introduced for overseas products, the cost of making regalia becomes even higher than it already was.
“This situation with the tariffs has been exceptionally challenging,” said Beth Simmons, owner of Shipwreck Beads in Lacey, Washington, a major resource for beaders on the West Coast that had been a frequent vendor at the annual Black Hills Powwow.
Simmons said Shipwreck Beads primarily imports from the Czech Republic, China and India as a main source for beads, though it does work with some U.S. manufacturers. All three of those countries have been the recipients of new tariffs.
“We’re trying to make [the price increases] as little as possible, but we still have to be able to pay for the beads and pay all of our employees,” Simmons told ICT. “We’re hopeful that the situation is resolved sometime in the next year and that it won’t be a thing moving forward, but we have to keep the lights on between now and then.”
‘No one is immune’
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has rolled out various new tariffs on imported goods, including broad tariffs on products from Taiwan, China and India, and the removal of the “de minimis” exemption on shipments from Canada into the United States. He also launched a 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports and derivatives in June.
The tariffs are part of Trump’s plan to boost domestic production and manufacturing. But that’s easier said than done, according to experts.
Any migration of manufacturing back to the U.S. would take two to four years to actually happen, leaving small businesses to deal with tariffs on imported goods in the meantime, Francisco Sánchez, the former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for Trade under President Barack Obama, told a gathering of journalists at the National Press Foundation in Washington, D.C., in September.
“You can’t turn that on a dime,” Sanchez said. “So it’s going to be challenging in terms of supply chain, it’s going to be challenging in terms of costs, and it affects across-the-board, whether it’s construction, whether it’s retail, hospitality, restaurants. No one is immune.”
A recognizable brand
Crane got serious about her regalia business in 2020, making it her full-time career.
An Ojibwe brand from the heart of Anishinaabe country, her business, Zazegaakwe, which means “prosperous woman” in Ojibwemowin, is known for its unique jingle dresses and woodland regalia with bright floral applique and eyecatching embellishments. 
It’s a recognizable brand at powwows across Canada and into the United States.
Crane is based in Lake of the Woods in Ontario, Canada, and ships regularly to the United States, she told ICT.
“Lake of the Woods, this is like the home of the jingle dress, where the stories and the creation, everything came out of,” Crane said. “So making jingle dresses here is essential for my business. It is literally, I would say, 75 percent of everything that I make.”
But it’s becoming more costly since the Trump administration ordered in June the 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports and derivatives. The tariff directly impacts all jingle cone producers, since no jingle cones are manufactured in the United States.
For Crane, that means the price of a bag of 100 cones has more than doubled, from about $25 Canadian to about $56 Canadian, or about $40 in U.S. dollars. Previously, she had been able to buy in bulk, but new shipping tariffs made that impossible. 
Jingle cones, which were originally made from chewing tobacco can lids, are now factory-made using tinplated metal. There are three major producers of jingle cones in the United States — Missouri River, which is owned by Crazy Crow Trading Post; the McPherson brand, which is owned by Wandering Bull Trading Post; and Teton Trade Cloth LLC’s new brand of jingle cones.
All three source their products from overseas, with Teton’s cones coming from China, according to federal import records. From there, the companies outsource their cones to smaller businesses across the country, to be sold typically in bags typically of 100.
None of the companies responded to requests from ICT for comment on the impact of tariffs.
In June, Taiwan, a major producer of jingle cones, was hit with a separate 30 percent tariff on goods imported to the United States, prompting a boost in jingle cone prices in the U.S.
Singing Horse Trading Post, an Indigenous-owned small business on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, has seen the most change from tariffs on jingle cones and imported leather goods. One employee said the business has had to change an extra one to two dollars per bag for the cones.

At least some of the cost, inevitably, is transferred to the consumer. Because of her brand recognition, Crane’s designs were already sold a little higher than typical regalia, but with the increase in cost to produce, she’s had no choice but to raise prices even more. 
Previously, she sold cotton-based jingle dresses without jingle cones attached for $750 Canadian. She’s now had to increase the prices to between $830-$850 Canadian because of her increased production costs. 
Shipping costs go up as well 
The impact on First Nations artisans  in Canada has been even steeper since the end of shipping tariff exemptions by the United States and another Canada Post strike.
Starting on Aug. 29, the United States suspended all duty-free “de minimis” thresholds on shipping from all countries, even Canada. The de minimis threshold previously allowed small amounts of purchases of under $800 to be exempt from tariffs, with the threshold’s removal all foreign shipments are now eligible for tariffs. Additionally, the elimination of the threshold means that postal shipments to the U.S. from Canada require prepaid duties before the package crosses the border and sometimes even after. 
Now,  when using the U.S. Postal Service, customers in the U.S. who received packages from Canada will need to pay fees when the packages arrive at their doors. These import fees are charges that the United States government has applied to goods shipped (or imported) into the United States from other countries. These fees can come in three different forms: duties, taxes and tariffs. UPS refers to these as International Collect on Delivery, or ICOD. Often these fees can only be paid by check, unless the customer goes through a lengthy process to pay online. The fee money collected from the receiver is then paid to the federal government by the postal service. 
For something like a $20 T-shirt, the American customer can expect to pay between $20 and $30 U.S. dollars in fees when the package arrives in addition to shipping costs already paid when ordering. If the customer doesn’t pay after the third delivery attempt, the package will be sent back to its place of origin. 
Crane said she primarily buys Missouri River Jingle Cones, which are produced in Taiwan and shipped to the United States. Previously. she purchased from the Manitoba-based company, Anishinaabe Bimishimo, before the company went on hiatus, leaving a gap in the domestic market until it returns.
‘Astronomical’ increases
Regalia was already costly to make when factoring in labor, fabric and other expenses, but now the tariffs have made the cost of production even higher, and not just because of jingle cones. The fabric is also harder and more-expensive to come by. 
Crane used to purchase directly from a retailer in the Los Angeles Fabric District, but that’s not possible anymore, she said. She also previously purchased trims, embellishments and branding tags from the United States, but with tariffs she’s had to change her sourcing for nearly all elements of design.
Even heat and bond, a material used for creating applique, is more expensive. 
“They’re astronomical,” Crane said about the tariffs. “I completely had to stop that [purchasing]. It wasn’t worth it anymore.”
She now shops locally in Canada, but the options are limited. Crane lives more than two hours from Winnipeg, the closest major city. 
Until the tariffs end, there’s not much that small businesses can do but wait for prices to go down, she said. 
“I do feel I feel for my customers,” Crane said. “Those tariffs, for lack of a better word, they suck. But hopefully whatever’s going on with American politics, it gets settled and the prices stop rising so fast.”

The fundraising battle over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50 isn’t close, but the race is. 
Since July, the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign has raised nearly $97 million — which does not include the nearly $13 million that billionaire investor Tom Steyer has spent separately to run his own pro-Prop. 50 ads. 
The No campaign, with about $42 million, has less than half of that haul, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang. 
The Yes campaign’s ads — which include big-name Democrats such as former President Barack Obama and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York — mostly emphasize pushing back against President Donald Trump. Steyer’s ad, for instance, urges voters to “stick it to Trump.”
And, the influential California Labor Federation reminded its 2 million members in a series of digital ads that the Trump administration fired federal workers and cut infrastructure spending.

Lorena Gonzalez, federation president, on the discussion labor organizers had about turning out students on college campuses: “Do we want to talk about ICE? Do we want to talk about LGBTQ (issues)? Do we want to say, ‘fight fascism?’ We settled on ‘f—k Trump.’”

But despite raising and spending more than its opponent, there’s no indication yet that the Yes campaign will win: A recent survey from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report found that while about 50% of registered voters said they would support Prop. 50, nearly half of those surveyed said they were undecided or only softly committed to voting on the measure.
It’s this undecided subset of voters that the No campaign is focusing on — tapping into voters’ general dislike of gerrymandering, as well as anti-Newsom sentiment among conservatives.

Jessica Millan Patterson, former state GOP chairperson and current chairperson of the No on Prop. 50 campaign: “We can’t win with just Republican votes, so we need to make sure that those persuadable voters … that the conversation is happening with them. They know that giving this power to politicians, it will not serve anyone but those politicians, and they just need some permission to vote no on this.”

Currently, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia’s district is located entirely in Los Angeles County. But under Prop. 50, the 42nd congressional district would encompass parts of conservative Orange County, including Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. This would mean that Garcia would take on more Republican voters than any other incumbent Democrat should he win re-election for the district in 2026.
Garcia, a Peruvian immigrant, is gay and known for slamming Trump. His stances on some issues are far from those endorsed by the conservative city council that would be in his potential new district. In recent years Huntington Beach banned flying the Pride flag on city property and passed an ordinance requiring voter ID. This summer it tried to create a library review panel to screen library books for sexual content, though voters ultimately rejected the proposal.
But Garcia is confident he will win next year, no matter how the districts are drawn, and views the redistricting effort as “the right thing to do.”

Dems call for congressional probe on ICE

Speaking of Garcia, the congressmember joined L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Monday to call for a congressional probe into allegations that federal immigration enforcement agents have been unlawfully detaining U.S. citizens.
Garcia is the top Democrat on the House’s oversight committee. Alongside U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who leads Democrats in the Senate’s subcommittee on investigations, they sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security demanding records and accusing federal agencies of detaining citizens “through the use of disproportionate force and fundamentally flawed rationale.”
The letter also cites a ProPublica investigation published last week that found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot, or held for more than a day without being allowed to contact anyone.
On Monday Bass said that immigration raids under Trump, which ramped up in the summer in L.A., was an “egregious moment in our history.”

Bass, at Monday’s press conference: “What is happening to undocumented immigrants is also happening to U.S. citizens, which means that this could happen to anyone, to all of us, at any period of time.”




And lastly: Towing RVs on the street

Cities are targeting people living in vehicles, issuing tickets and towing under parking rules. Last week the governor signed a bill making it easier for some cities to dispose of RVs parked on their streets. CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on why critics say this would remove much-needed shelter as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom once embraced reparations, but as he nears the end of his governorship, his slow roll out continues for legislation that directly addresses compensation for Californians who are descendants of enslaved people.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will keep entering hospitals, so it’s crucial that hospitals ramp up education and training quickly in order to protect patients and prepare nurses, writes Kimberly Galindo, a nurse at Riverside Community Hospital.

Kimberly Galindo is a nurse at Riverside Community Hospital


Armed men with dark, bulletproof vests entered my hospital unit just before dawn on June 19 and began loudly insisting I take them to a patient’s room. 
The agents demanded confidential information, saying the patient they were looking for had been detained before. They didn’t show any formal identification or a warrant.
I instantly knew they were with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE raids have spread terror throughout our communities. Federal agents had been targeting worksites, schools and court houses, but that morning they’d set sights on Riverside Community Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center. 
As an experienced nurse, I knew I didn’t have to comply with their request and refused to give them any information about the patient or where the patient was. After I repeatedly but calmly denied the ICE agents’ access, they eventually left my floor.
A less experienced nurse might not have this confidence, which comes with many years on the job. I knew the agents’ demands were a clear violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the federal law protecting all patients’ privacy. 
Riverside Community Hospital is part of HCA Healthcare, one of the largest for-profit hospital chains in the country, caring for more than 43 million patients annually. HCA and all hospitals have a responsibility to protect patients and to support nurses, who serve their communities every day. 
That means issuing clear, formal policies that outline what to do when ICE enters the hospital. And it means training nurses, doctors and all frontline staff to uphold our ethical and legal responsibilities, even in the face of outrageous federal overreach. 
What happened that day was a clear violation of federal and state law. I believe any nurse would call it a “never event” — a serious, preventable and potentially costly error — that should not happen to any patient, under any circumstance. 
ICE has reportedly shown up at hospitals in Oxnard and Glendale and a surgical center just outside of Los Angeles. These actions sow fear and confusion. They disrupt patient care, violate privacy and run counter to state and federal patient protections. 
As a direct result, many immigrant patients are avoiding care altogether, afraid that they or a family member could be arrested. 
Nurses also are being placed in impossible positions, forced to choose between our livelihoods and our duty to care, protect and advocate for our patients. Nurses take a pledge to speak out on behalf of patients, not to report them. We are ethically and legally bound to protect private health information.
The men that day acted as if our ethical and legal duty was just an annoying inconvenience for them. 
Thankfully, California lawmakers recently took action to protect hospital patients from ICE’s reach. Legislators passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 81, which prohibits ICE agents from accessing non-public areas of California hospitals when they don’t have a warrant. 
It also expands patient privacy protections to include immigration status and place of birth. And it requires hospitals to train staff on how to respond when ICE agents request access to protected areas or patient information. Now, all California hospitals must comply. 
In this unprecedented climate, it is incumbent on hospital operators across the nation to create an environment of protection and calm. Health care workers must never be pressured to identify patients based on nationality or immigration status. If hospitals compel health care workers to do so, they would be violating the law. 
Even worse, they would be deepening the trauma ICE already has inflicted on many communities and compromising the trust that must be at the heart of health care.
Unfortunately, we’re now seeing the Trump administration completely disregard an existing California law that bars ICE from making arrests at courthouses. Hospitals should anticipate that ICE will keep coming and ramp up education and training quickly — to protect patients and prepare nurses.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/081425-US-CBP-Raid-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-21 08:57:33.019690

Supporters are doing everything they can to make the election about Trump.,"In summary
Opponents of Prop. 50 want voters to resist gerrymandering. Supporters are doing everything they can to make the election about Trump.


California, listen up: Former President Barack Obama wants you to know that the whole nation is counting on you this November. 
“Democracy is on the ballot,” the 44th president says straight to camera in the latest advertisement from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s campaign for Proposition 50, the ballot question that asks voters to temporarily gerrymander California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats. 
“Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,” Obama continues in the seven-figure ad buy airing across California, referring to GOP-led redistricting efforts President Donald Trump has backed in other states like Texas. “With Prop. 50, you can stop Republicans in their tracks.”
As voters face a Nov. 4 deadline to turn in their ballots, California’s redistricting fight has reached a pinnacle as both sides pour tens of millions of dollars on their final push to persuade and mobilize voters. The Yes side has largely outraised and outspent its opponents, pulling in nearly $97 million — more than double the No side’s haul of $42 million — and garnered far more big names to appear in its ads. 
Still, recent polling shows the race remains close, and persuasion in the final weeks is critical for both sides. While opponents of Prop. 50 are going all-in on a good governance message and playing on most voters’ unease with politicians drawing their own districts, supporters of the measure are doubling down on anti-Trump rhetoric. And both campaigns are trying to turn out Latino voters, a key constituency that could swing the election.
A survey from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report earlier this month found that although 50% of registered voters said they would support Prop. 50 and 35% said they would oppose it, nearly half of those surveyed indicated they were undecided or only softly committed to their vote. The poll included 918 registered voters with a sampling error margin of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.
There’s still plenty of time to sway voters, especially those who are just now tuning into the fact that an election is happening. If voters approve Prop. 50, California would temporarily adopt gerrymandered maps drawn by Democrats through 2030 and suspend the ones drawn by an independent citizens redistricting commission just four years ago. The ballot question informs voters that California’s redistricting is a direct response to Texas Republicans’ decision to redraw their district lines mid-decade.

And when it comes to persuasion, money is critical. 
More than 68,000 people have given money in support of the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign since July, according to campaign finance data analyzed by CalMatters, with the biggest contributions coming from the House Majority PAC controlled by congressional Democrats and the Fund for Policy Reform controlled by Democratic megadonor George Soros. That doesn’t include the nearly $13 million that billionaire investor Tom Steyer spent separately to run his own ads supporting the measure. 
By contrast, only 200 contributors have given to the two separate No campaigns, including a massive $30 million from wealthy Republican physicist Charles Munger Jr., who funded the 2008 and 2010 efforts to establish the state’s independent redistricting commission. 
“‘No’ has the steeper hill to climb, there’s no doubt about that,” said Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report. She explained that opponents of Prop. 50 would not only need to solidify their tentative supporters and ensure they vote, but also persuade all undecided voters and also convert some of the tentative “yes” voters.
But working in the opposition’s favor is widespread unease with the idea of elected officials influencing the shape of their districts. About 56% of the Cook poll’s respondents who indicated they would probably vote “Yes” said they agreed that politicians shouldn’t draw their own district lines.
“If you’re the ‘No’ campaign, it is the one place where you can see you can get some traction,” Walter said.
Opportunity for Prop. 50 opponents
Opponents of Prop. 50 are trying hard to capitalize on that discomfort in their recent advertising.
“Prop. 50 takes us backwards and rips power away from the people,” an unidentified woman tells viewers in a recent No on 50 advertisement. Then the declaration “Politicians Can Rig Elections” flashes across the screen in bold red and black text.
Jessica Millan Patterson, the former state GOP chairperson who is leading the No on 50 campaign backed by House Republicans, said she’s targeting independents and Democrats who are dissatisfied with the party. That means focusing on a limited, simple good-governance message to turn out undecided voters. 
Millan Patterson isn’t concerned about mobilizing the Republican base, she said, adding that the Yes campaign is already doing that for her by demonizing Trump and deifying Newsom, whom conservatives despise. In a small nod to the party faithful, the campaign is running one advertisement criticizing the governor. It hammers him on affordability.
“We can’t win with just Republican votes, so we need to make sure that those persuadable voters … that the conversation is happening with them,” Millan Patterson said. “They know that giving this power to politicians, it will not serve anyone but those politicians, and they just need some permission to vote no on this.”
That mirrors the message of the other No campaign paid for by Munger. 
“If you look at all the polling since the beginning, voters don’t like gerrymandering, full stop,” said Amy Thoma Tan, spokesperson for that campaign. “So we’re just reminding people that this is gerrymandering.”
California unions settle on Trump message
By contrast, their opponents on the Yes side are investing heavily in an anti-Trump message, a move that Walter said was smart given that the president is “the special catalyst” that helps the Yes side overcome California voters’ traditional preference for rejecting ballot measures.
In digital ads, the powerful California Labor Federation is reminding its 2 million members that Trump has terminated federal workers’ contracts and cut infrastructure spending, which paid for many trades workers’ projects.

But in phone-banking operations, its president Lorena Gonzalez said the catch-all framing of Prop. 50 as a way to “fight back against Trump” works best to motivate voters, who all “know what they’re not happy about.”
“Do we want to talk about ICE? Do we want to talk about LGBTQ (issues)? Do we want to say, ‘fight fascism?’” Gonzalez said of discussion among labor organizers working to turn out students on University of California campuses. 
The Service Employees International Union of California is taking an all-of-the-above approach, said Tia Orr, the union’s executive director. A digital advertisement urges viewers to fight back against the Trump administration’s “inhumane immigration policies” by supporting Prop. 50. And a recent mailer sent to SEIU’s 800,000 California members, many of whom work in health care, reminded them that the Republican-controlled Congress approved Trump’s megabill that would take health insurance coverage from an estimated 10 million Americans. 
“I urge all registered nurses to volunteer, vote, and share the message with your friends and family,” reads the mailer, written in the first person and signed by Monique Hernandez, vice president of an SEIU local that represents nurses. 
In Asian American immigrant communities, pro-Prop. 50 organizers are emphasizing cuts to health care programs and how Trump policies destabilize local economies — a nod to tariffs. For Latino voters, the Yes campaign is airing ads in English and Spanish featuring New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was forced to the ground by federal agents in Los Angeles this summer during the height of the immigration raids that jolted the city. 
Latino voters “the most undecided”
Latino voters, the state’s largest racial group and about 30% of likely voters, are a key constituency that could swing the election. 
Affordability remains a top priority for Latino voters, a survey by the Latino Community Foundation of 1,200 Latino registered voters in California in September shows. But they also disapproved of the president by wide margins, and felt pessimistic about their personal economic prospects in higher shares than ever, vice president of policy Christian Arana said. By a three-to-one margin they said they felt Trump had betrayed them on immigration. 
“There’s a lot of people that say if you really want to talk to Latino voters, you only have to talk about the economy,” said Yes on 50 consultant Juan Rodriguez. “It’s a false choice. You can’t just talk about kitchen-table issues when they’re burning down your house.”
The campaign has spent more than $10 million specifically on Latino outreach, Rodriguez said, including broadcast, digital, print and radio ads in Spanish and English, and phone banking operations with Latino community groups. 
Still, Arana called Latinos “the most undecided voter.” Latino approval for Prop. 50 is just under 50% in the Inland Empire and Central Valley, according to the group’s survey, which has a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.
Arana is most concerned that fears of immigration or other federal agents showing up to polling places could depress turnout, particularly as immigration raids in California and elsewhere have ensnared U.S. citizens. The survey showed two-thirds of Latino voters statewide are concerned about immigration enforcement this election. 
Democratic organizers emphasized in a recent Zoom call for volunteers that they were pushing for early voting by mail instead.

(Getty Images)Veterans and service members in Utah may have an easier way to transition back into the workforce next year, when lawmakers consider a bill counting their skills learned in the military toward state occupational licensing coursework.
The Veterans and Military Affairs Commission had an initial view of the draft sponsored by Sen. Heidi Balderree, R-Saratoga Springs, that would direct the Utah Division of Professional Licensing to create a public document identifying where military experience is substantially equivalent to state licensing requirements in consultation with the Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs.

“Right now, many veterans complete rigorous, high-level training in the armed forces, skills that often match or exceed civilian standards, but they still face redundant coursework or certification hurdles when applying for a professional license,” Balderree told the commission on Monday.
The bill would also require the division to count verified military training and experience toward civilian licensure. A report due late 2028 would inform the Legislature how the program has been utilized.
During the meeting, Jason Chipman, director of public policy at the Libertas Institute think tank, said the legislation is modeled after the “military occupational crosswalk” implemented in Pennsylvania, a law that eases and expedites the path to licensure for service members, veterans and their spouses. 
SLC ranked among ‘most patriotic cities,’ but how many veterans use their benefits?

“All of the money and time that we spend putting somebody through school, through all the training year after year, especially if they if they do a career in the service, is almost wasted when they get out and they’re told they can’t keep doing what they were trained to do in the civilian world,” Chipman said, “even though they’re probably just as qualified, if not more, than many civilians are.”
Veterans and service members would still be required to take exams for certain licenses, but could skip mandatory training for skills they acquired in the military. 
The Libertas Institute has already created a document to advise the Division of Professional Licensing on equivalences between licenses and military occupational job duties. Mostly it tackles some of the “heavy jobs,” Chipman said.
Under the proposal, veterans trained on pavement, construction equipment, quarrying or cargo work could fast-track their crane operator license, Navy barbers could count military work hours toward a cosmetology license, and so on. 
Mark Steinagel, director of the Division of Professional Licensing said his office is eager to become a leader in helping military members and veterans to receive credit for their education and experience. However, the division is neutral on the proposal after the bill sponsor updated the draft with a couple of suggestions that moved some dates and eliminated the potential requirement to create a complete new interface for the system. 
“Probably the primary reason we’re neutral is that the current bill draft probably has a fiscal impact,” Steinagel said. “And of course, we need to support whatever budget the governor submits.”

The Alabama State Department of Education said Monday that K-12 enrollment had declined by 5,800 students, the largest drop in 40 years. . (Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Enrollment in Alabama’s K-12 schools dropped by 5,800 students in the 2025-26 school year, according to numbers released Monday the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). 
The department says the decline is the biggest enrollment drop in 40 years. The K-12 population dropped from 720,181 in 2024-25 to 714,358 in 2025-26, a 0.8% decrease. 
School officials told members of the Alabama State Board of Education at their meeting earlier this month that the numbers would show a decline. Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said at the meeting that students using the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program, and students being enrolled but not going to school is where the decline is most likely coming from.
“We have essentially 2,100 kids that were enrolled last year that just didn’t show up. They didn’t transfer to private school, they didn’t go to home school, they didn’t go to school in another state. They just disappeared,” Mackey told board members.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, which oversees the Education Trust Fund Budget, said in an interview Friday the decline in enrollment was expected.
“Just one, because of the population, the demographics and things like that,” he said. “Number two, we knew that it was some anticipation from the CHOOSE Act. I think we have about 3000 kids equipped from public schools to private or home school. And I think, on the national landscape, you’re seeing more people consider homeschooling and microschooling and charter schools and things like that. I think that will continue.”
In July, around 3,000 students who were enrolled in a public school took CHOOSE Act funds and switched to private education.
Microschools are learning environments that are designed and operated to work with the specific needs of the students they serve. However, state regulations have yet to catch up.
Ryan Hollingsworth, executive director of School Superintendents of Alabama, said the decline in enrollment could lead to teacher jobs disappearing for the upcoming school year. Teaching positions are funded in part by the attendance within schools. 
“Teacher units awarded by the state are based upon the average daily membership (student enrollment) of a school for the first 20 days after Labor Day. With the loss of students this fall, our schools will earn less state teacher units for the fall of 26. This could be extremely challenging if the loss is concentrated in one or two schools within the district instead of district-wide,” Hollingsworth said in the statement.
Garrett said Friday the teacher jobs shouldn’t be significantly affected by the decline because of the nationwide teacher shortage.
“I’m speculating somewhat, but I don’t believe we should see a massive impact on the number of teachers because right now we have a teacher shortage,” he said.
Garrett also said he doesn’t expect the decline to affect the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) Act. The RAISE Act allocates supplemental funding to public schools based on the amount of students enrolled in different categories including English language learners, poverty, special education, gifted students and those attending charter schools. It represented an attempt to start moving Alabama from an average daily attendance model to one that aims to connect resources to places of greatest need.
“If you have a pot of money, you have fewer people in the denominator, then the math would say more dollars per child would go to that effort. Again, we’ve already pulled down what we anticipate to be three years worth of funding, and I don’t think that would impact that,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-21 08:16:34.375341

In a press conference with Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed on Monday, Graboys called on lawmakers to extend the number of crimes covered by Aniah’s Law – a constitutional amendment listing the charges that a judge may deny bond for. 
“Too often, violent crimes are committed by individuals who are already out on bond for other serious offenses. This pattern of repeat-violence puts our community and our officers at risk,” Graboys said. “I am again calling on our judicial system to partner with us in ensuring that violent offenders are held accountable and do not have the opportunity to re-offend. True public safety requires follow through from the first arrest to the final resolution.”

Police have arrested four suspects in connection to the shooting. Kemontae Hood, 21, Dantavious McGhee, 19, and an unnamed juvenile were charged with one count of capital murder, nine counts of first-degree assault and three counts of second-degree assault, each. Javorick Whiting, 19, was charged last week with one count of attempted murder, and was released on bail for $60,000 Monday morning, Graboys said. 
Aniah’s Law is a constitutional amendment that the Legislature passed in 2021 and which state voters approved in 2022. Prior to passage, judges could only deny bond to individuals charged with capital murder. Aniah’s Law expanded that to include those charged with violent crimes including kidnapping, first-degree rape, sodomy, arson, robbery, domestic violence and aggravated child abuse.
The law was named for Aniah Blanchard, a Southern Union Community College student who went missing in late 2019 from a convenience store. Her body was found a month later. Ibrahim Yazeed, indicted on capital murder charges in Blanchard’s death, was out on bond on several violent crime charges, including kidnapping, at the time of Blanchard’s death.
Legislators this spring approved an expansion of the law to include firing into an occupied dwelling, soliciting, attempting or engaging in a conspiracy to commit murder. The law is up for consideration by voters on May 19. Gov. Kay Ivey urged voters in a statement Monday afternoon to remember the Montgomery shooting when they vote next spring.
“This is exactly the legal loophole that I and many in the Legislature sought to close when I signed the Safe Alabama package,” Ivey said. “Next May, all Alabama voters will have a chance to end mandatory bail for those suspected of attempted murder by voting to expand Aniah’s Law. I will not forget today’s troubling news when casting my vote.”
Graboys called on legislators Monday to expand the list to include all violent crimes, including attempted murder. Whiting’s charge last week is his only record of violent crime, according to court records.  
“We need assistance, both legislatively and in the judicial system, about what we’re going to do. I think Aniah’s Law has been a great law, but maybe it’s to be expanded,” Graboys said. “Maybe people need to use the discretion that Aniah’s Law gives them to hold people for trial when they’ve been arrested for violent felonies.”
Graboys said the investigation will stay open until all involved, directly or indirectly, are held accountable. To prove his point, he said MPD arrested a fifth suspect last week in connection with a September 2024 shooting. 
“We don’t care how long it takes. We’re going to go and pursue every investigation until its full completion and until we get every individual that has been involved is charged,” Graboys said.
Mayor Reed said Monday the investigation into the shooting is “not over by a longshot,” and called for justice and bond reform, as well as “common sense” gun reform.
“We shouldn’t wait for the next mass shooting to happen,” Reed said. “Whether it’s attempted murder, that $60,000 bond, that’s a slap in the face to the victims. It’s a slap in the face in this community and everybody involved. And we’ve got to think through how do you do things proactively when it comes to these types of legislative matters, as opposed to reacting.”
The shooting took place during celebrations following a football game in Montgomery on Oct. 4. Police said Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43, were killed in the shooting. Graboys said that the victims’ injury status has not changed, but according to WSFA, two victims with life-threatening injuries have been upgraded to non-life-threatening injuries.

,California,2025-10-21 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom embraced reparations at first. Now he’s slow rolling them,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-reparations-california-slow-roll/,"Since creating California's reparations task force five years ago, Newsom has signed few of its bills while slowing most that would have directed money or benefits to Black Californians.","George Floyd, a Black man who had been detained by Minneapolis police after a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill, died as Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, ignoring Floyd’s complaints that he could not breathe.
A video of Floyd’s May 25, 2020 death triggered massive protests throughout the nation and across the globe, energizing the Black Lives Matter movement that had been founded in 2013.
Four months after Floyd’s death, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three bills to address, he said, “the scourge of racial injustice rooted in the legacy of slavery and systemic racism,” including one authorizing a nine-member task force to study reparations for Black Californians.
 “As a nation, we can only truly thrive when every one of us has the opportunity to thrive,” Newsom declared. “California’s rich diversity is our greatest asset, and we won’t turn away from this moment to make right the discrimination and disadvantages that Black Californians and people of color still face.”
Three years later, in 2023, the task force produced a 1,060-page report that catalogued California’s discriminatory treatment of Black people after its 1850 admission as a state that officially prohibited slavery. The report recommended “appropriate remedies of compensation, rehabilitation, and restitution for African Americans, with a special consideration for African Americans who are descendants of persons enslaved in the United States.
“Compensation should be provided for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case,” the task force wrote.
The report identified a series of reparations amounts for various purposes, with some estimates amounting to $360,000 for each of the 1.8 million Black Californians deemed to have enslaved ancestors. That would total nearly $650 billion — about twice the state’s annual budget.
News coverage of the eye popping figure put Newsom on the spot. He responded with what political pros call a slow roll — seeming to support something but finding excuses to delay actually doing the something.
Initially Newsom said in a statement that “dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments,” but when news media suggested he was backing away from his implied 2020 support of reparations, he issued another statement to the Sacramento Bee:
“The sensationalized framing in pieces published by outlets like Fox News and others is inaccurate. The governor looks forward to reviewing the final report — and all recommendations — when complete.” Newsom’s chief communication advisor, Anthony York, said that the cash payments issue “will be resolved” after Newsom meets with legislative leaders later in the year.
Two years later, the slow roll continues.
Black legislators have submitted many bills to implement pieces of the 2023 report, but without Newsom’s support, none has broached cash reparations, and he has been very selective about which bills he accepts. Last year, he vetoed a bill that would have allowed descendants of slaves seek redress for Black-owned land seized by public agencies.
This year, the Legislature’s Black Caucus introduced 16 bills in its “Road to Repair” agenda. A few made it to Newsom’s desk, and he vetoed five of them. Two he signed give up to $6 million to the state university system to study ways of identifying descendants of slaves and create a Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery to fashion a reparation structure.
Effectively, Newsom’s slow roll protects him from taking any meaningful actions, thus bequeathing reparations to his successor, like his many other unresolved California issues.
From a purely political standpoint it makes perfect sense. Newsom’s governorship is drawing to a close. He obviously wants to become president of the United States, and financial reparations are not popular nationally.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092322_Reparations_TaskForceMeeting_PU_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-21 08:16:34.375341

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) said she does not see an upcoming end to the federal government shutdown as it stretches into its fourth week.","Attendees packed the Sandoval County Commission chambers during an Oct. 20, 2025 town hall with U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) to ask questions about the federal government shutdown and other concerns under the Trump administration. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)During a Rio Rancho town hall with 80 attendees Monday afternoon, U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) said she does not see an upcoming end to the federal government shutdown as it stretches into its fourth week.
“I’m not optimistic that we’ll be out of the shutdown soon,” she told people gathered in the Sandoval County Commission chambers. “They canceled votes this week. We’re scheduled to have votes next week, but in the interviews I heard today from the Republican leadership, they said that they’re not compromising and they’re not reopening the government.”
As of Monday, the shutdown, which began Oct. 1, became the third longest full government shutdown in history. It began after Congress was unable to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill. New Mexico Democrats said they would not budge until Republicans agree to extend tax credits for people who purchase health insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Town hall attendees posed a wide range of questions on the shutdown and more, including: the potential impacts to federal retiree benefits; how to address government mistrust; and the Trump administration’s plan to send $40 billion to Argentina. The attendees also aired concerns about the size of the federal deficit and the country’s credit rating.
The Monday event followed Saturday’s No Kings protests in New Mexico and across the country, in which organizers said millions of Americans took to the streets protesting President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies. Stansbury, who attended the Albuquerque rally, said the No Kings protests constitute one of the best tools to increase political pressure, and urged attendees “to really take care of each other, keep having courage and we’re going to have to keep standing up and speaking out.”

Attendee Dan Donahue, 57, an independent voter, posed the  federal deficit question, and told Source NM that Stansbury provided “all the answers and more.” A lawyer, Donahue said he felt the need to attend the town hall to address what he sees as “unconstitutional methods” by the Trump administration to consolidate power in the executive.
“While I agree with some of the goals of the Trump administration, the methods that they are using to achieve these goals are just unconstitutional,” he said.

During the town hall, Stansbury told attendees the blame for the shutdown lies solely on the shoulders of Republicans, noting that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has full control of the calendar.
“If the Speaker of the House wanted to pass the budget today, he could literally, literally call us back right this minute,” Stansbury said.
Stansbury said, in the meantime, her office would soon start hosting resource fairs for federal workers who are working without pay or people concerned about looking for food assistance or healthcare.
“What they’re doing is punishing the American people, and we know that it’s going to harm real families,” Stansbury said.
Stansbury credited New Mexico state lawmakers for passing legislation to address federal impacts during the two-day Oct. 1 special session, and said the state was looking into legal options to address a recent memo from the federal government warning that it would end funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.
“There will absolutely be legal action against the administration trying to essentially impound funding,” Stansbury told Source NM in an interview after the town hall.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis)U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the Nevada National Security Site Monday to highlight the shutdown’s impact on the federal agency tasked with managing and modernizing America’s nuclear weapons.
The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, which falls under the Energy Department, furloughed a majority of its workforce on Monday as the government shutdown dragged into its third week. It’s the first time since the agency’s creation in 2000 that workers have been furloughed.
“We did everything we could to keep our federal workers here employed as long as possible. But unfortunately, today is the day our ability to deploy funds to pay those workers ended,” Wright said at a press conference Monday.
Nationally, about 1,400 employees were sent home Monday, leaving fewer than 400 to safeguard the U.S. nuclear stockpile. In Nevada, all 68 federal employees at the Nevada National Security Site were furloughed.
While the agency doesn’t directly handle U.S. nuclear weapons, the department is tasked with improving national security by safeguarding the US nuclear stockpile and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe. The agency is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of nuclear weapons and materials. 
Wright said NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation, which transports nuclear weapons and materials within the U.S., had enough funding to operate until Oct. 27.  Wright also said the agency had enough funding “to keep our contractors employed at least through the end of the month.” 
Unlike federal employees, contractors can’t be paid back for the time they spent furloughed. Only four contractors remained working at the Nevada National Security Site.

“If they’re furloughed, they’re not going to get paid. If that continues on for weeks more – they’ve got families to support – they’re going to go get jobs elsewhere. But the federal government, we can’t afford to lose those workers. We need them,” Wright said. 
At the press conference, Wright said there was no immediate national security threat as a result of the furloughs and “a certain number of mission critical folks…are still working.”
However, Wright said the furloughed employees are “among the most critical workers in our country.”
“They test, maintain, and ultimately construct a modernized version of our nuclear stock. We need to take that deathly serious. We’ve never had to furlough in this area before. We need to end this as soon as possible,” Wright said. 
A press secretary for the Department of Energy said the difference this year from prior federal shutdowns was a reduction in carryover funding by the Biden administration last year before he left office, so there isn’t as much of a financial cushion as in prior shutdowns.
“They instructed them to reduce the carryover funding because they thought it was too large. So that’s why we’re in a different situation,” said Ben Dietderich, press secretary and chief spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy.
Wright blamed Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the continued shutdown, but he also thanked Nevada’s Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto for being one of only two Democrats to vote for a Republican stopgap spending bill that would end the shutdown.
“I thank her for her courage and for standing with our workers here in Nevada and with our country’s national security,” Wright said.
The overwhelming majority of Cortez Masto’s Democratic colleagues in both the Senate and the U.S. House opposed the Republican spending bill because it failed to restore Affordable Care Act subsidies that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration curtailed earlier this year. Health insurance premiums are projected to increase substantially as a result.
Wright called on Democrats to support the Republican-led spending bill, describing it as “a clean spending bill that just continues the spending levels exactly as they were before.”
Earlier this month, Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said Democrats would have to be “naive” to vote for a Republican funding plan to reopen the government without first obtaining firm commitments that Republicans will reverse course and extend health insurance subsidies so as to prevent skyrocketing premiums.
Wright said Rosen abstaining from a vote to reopen the government earlier this month was a sign that more Democrats may do as Cortez Masto has and vote with the Republicans.
“Last vote she abstained. I think she wants to vote with us. I think she’s going to be part of reopening the government,” Wright said. 
A spokesperson for Rosen’s office said Nevada’s junior senator missed the vote because of “significant flight delays outside of her control that led her to miss two votes a couple of weeks ago,” adding that “Rosen would have opposed the Republican resolution that does nothing to fix the health care crisis.”
“Donald Trump and Washington Republicans control Congress and the White House – and it’s on them to end this government shutdown and take action to prevent a spike in health care costs for hardworking families,” Rosen said in a statement Monday. 
“The Trump Administration would rather continue this shutdown and furlough federal workers, including at the Nevada National Security Site, than work across party lines to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits that families rely on to keep their health care affordable,” Rosen said.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted this could become the longest government shutdown in American history as negotiations between Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse.
The current shutdown has already exceeded the historical average of eight days for government shutdowns dating back to the late 1970s. The longest shutdown on record lasted 35 days during President Donald Trump’s first term, resulting in $11 billion in lost economic productivity, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC08012-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-21 08:16:34.375341

(Photo courtesy Linda Faso)A $15,000 donation from longtime animal activist Linda Faso to Hearts Alive Village Clinic will help Southern Nevadans spay and neuter their pit bull and bully mixes, preventing more from ending up in shelters where they are frequently euthanized.
“Pit bulls and pit bull mixes make up the majority of shelter intake across the country, and tragically, they are also the breed most likely to be euthanized,” says a news release from Hearts Alive Village Clinic, a nonprofit facility that offers low-cost veterinary services. “Barriers such as cost and access to veterinary care make it difficult for families to obtain spay/neuter services, leading to more accidental litters and more dogs at risk.”
The cost of spay and neuter surgeries, which is often based on the weight of the animal, can total hundreds of dollars for pit bulls.  Through the Alexis Project, which is named in memory of Faso’s granddog, owners pay a deposit between $66 and $116, based on their pet’s weight, for neuter surgery, and between $81 and $151 for spay surgery. The remaining cost is covered by the project. 
An online form is available to pet owners interested in securing a spot for their pit bull or bully mix. 
“Alexis was an incredibly special soul,” Faso said. “Every pit bull deserves the chance to be loved and to live safely in a home. This project is my way of keeping that promise that she inspired.” 
The effort, she said, is not “about favoritism toward a specific breed but about preventing births of the breed that is overflowing in shelters,” and will benefit local shelters and animal control agencies by reducing the number of pit bulls.  
“This project is about saving lives through prevention, keeping families whole, and giving pit bull dogs the chance they deserve,” Christy Stevens, executive director of Hearts Alive Village, said via a news release.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alexis.jpg,,,2025-10-21 08:16:34.375341

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)What happens now?
That may well be the question being asked by “No Kings” protesters, who marched, rallied and danced all over the nation on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.
Pro-democracy groups had aimed to encourage large numbers of Americans to demonstrate that “together we are choosing democracy.” They were successful, with crowds turning out for demonstrations in thousands of cities and towns from Anchorage to Miami.
And while multiple GOP leaders had attacked the planned demonstrations, describing them as “hate America” rallies, political science scholars and national security experts agree that the current U.S. administration’s actions are indeed placing the world’s oldest continuous constitutional republic in jeopardy.
Once a democracy starts to erode, it can be difficult to reverse the trend. Only 42% of democracies affected by autocratization – a transformation in governance that erodes democratic safeguards – since 1994 have rebounded after a democratic breakdown, according to Swedish research institute V-Dem.
Often termed “democratic backsliding,” such periods involve government-led changes to rules and norms to weaken individual freedoms and undermine or eliminate checks on power exercised by independent institutions, both governmental and non-governmental.
Democracies that have suffered setbacks vary widely, from Hungary to Brazil. As a longterm practitioner of democracy-building overseas, I know that none of these countries rival the United States’ constitutional traditions, federalist system, economic wealth, military discipline, and vibrant independent media, academia and nonprofit organizations.
Even so, practices used globally to fight democratic backsliding or topple autocracies can be instructive.
In a nutshell: Nonviolent resistance is based on noncooperation with autocratic actions. It has proven more effective in toppling autocracies than violent, armed struggle.
But it requires more than street demonstrations.
 Tactics used by pro-democracy movements

So, what does it take for democracies to bounce back from periods of autocratic rule?
Broad-scale, coordinated mobilization of a sufficient percentage of the population against autocratic takeover and for a renewed democratic future is necessary for success.
That momentum can be challenging to generate. Would-be autocrats create environments of fear and powerlessness, using intimidation, overwhelming force or political and legal attacks, and other coercive tactics to force acquiescence and chill democratic pushback.
Autocrats can’t succeed alone. They rely on what scholars call “pillars of support” – a range of government institutions, security forces, business and other sectors in society to obey their will and even bolster their power grabs.
However, everyone in society has power to erode autocratic support in various ways. While individual efforts are important, collective action increases impact and mitigates the risks of reprisals for standing up to individuals or organizations.
Here are some of the tactics used by those movements across the world:
1. Refuse unlawful, corrupt demands
When enough individuals in critical roles and institutions – the military, civil servants, corporate leaders, state government and judges – refuse to implement autocratic orders, it can slow or even stop an autocratic takeover. In South Korea, parts of the civil service, legislature and military declined to support President Yoon Suk Yeol’s imposition of martial law in 2024, foiling his autocratic move.
2. Visibly bolster the rule of law
Where would-be autocrats disregard legal restraints and install their supporters in the highest courts, individual challenges to overreach, even if successful, can be insufficient. In Poland, legal challenges in courts combined with public education by the judiciary, lawyers’ associations initiatives and street protests like the “March of a Thousand Robes” in 2020 to signal widespread repudiation of the autocratic government’s attacks on the rule of law.
3. Unite in opposition
This year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Corina Machado from Venezuela, is an example of how political parties and leaders who cooperate across differences can offer an alternative vision.
Novel candidates can undermine the ability of autocrats to sow division and demonize major opponents. However, coalitions can be difficult to form and sustain to win. Based on experiences overseas, historian Anne Applebaum, author of “Autocracy Inc.,” has called for a pro-democracy coalition in the U.S. that could unite independents, Libertarians, the Green Party, dissident Republicans and the Democratic Party.
4. Harness economic power
Everyday consumers can pressure wealthy elites and corporations that acquiesce to, or prop up, would-be autocrats through boycotts and other methods, like the “Tesla Takedown” in the U.S. that preceded a drop in Tesla share value and owner Elon Musk’s departure from his government role. General strikes, led by labor unions and professional associations, as in Sudan or Myanmar, can be particularly effective.
5. Preempt electoral manipulation
Voting autocrats out of office remains the best way to restore democracy, demonstrated recently by the u-turn in Brazil, where a pro-democracy candidate defeated the hard-right incumbent. But this requires strategic action to keep elections truly free and fair well in advance of election day.
6. Organize your community
As in campaigns in India starting in 2020 and Chile in 2019, participating in community or private conversation forums, local town halls or councils, and nonpartisan student, veterans, farmers, women’s and religious groups provides the space to share concerns, exchange ideas and create avenues to take action. Often starting with trusted networks, local initiatives can tap into broader statewide or national efforts to defend democracy.
7. Shape the story
Driving public opinion and communicating effectively is critical to pro-democracy efforts. Serbian students created one of the largest protest movements in decades starting in 2024 using creative resistance – artistic expression, such as visual mediums, satire and social media – to expose an autocrat’s weaknesses, reduce fear and hopelessness and build collective symbolism and resilience.
8. Build bridges and democratic alternatives
Bringing together people across ideological and other divides can increase understanding and counter political polarization, particularly when religious leaders are involved. Even in autocratic countries like Turkey or during wartime as in Ukraine, deepening democratic practices at state and local levels, like citizen assemblies and the use of technologies that improve the quality of public decision-making, can demonstrate ways to govern differently.
Parallel institutions, such as schools and tax systems operating outside the formal repressive system, like during Slobodan Milosevic’s decade-long crackdown in Kosovo, have sustained non-cooperation and shaped a future vision.
9. Document abuses, protect people, reinforce truth
With today’s technologies, every citizen can record repressive incidents, track corruption and archive historical evidence such as preserving proof of slavery at danger of being removed in public museums in the U.S., or collecting documentation of human rights violations in Syria. This can also entail bearing witness, including by accompanying those most targeted with abusive government tactics. These techniques can bolster the survival of independent and evidence-based media, science and collective memory.
10. Mitigate risk, learn and innovate
The success rate of nonviolent civil resistance is declining while repressive tactics by autocrats are evolving. Democracy defenders are forced to rapidly adjust, consistently train, prepare for diverse scenarios, try new techniques and strategically support each other.
International solidarity from global institutions, like European Union support for democrats in Belarus or Georgia, or online movements, like the Milk Tea Alliance across Southeast Asia, can bolster efforts.
 Democracy’s future?

The end of American democracy is not a foregone conclusion, despite the unprecedented rate of its decline. It will depend, in part, on the choices made by every American.
With autocracies outnumbering democracies for the first time in 20 years, and only 12% of the world’s population now living in a liberal democracy, the future of the global democratic experiment may well depend on the people of the United States.

Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, wants to ban federal immigration agents from wearing masks during raids. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, said she would seek to ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces during enforcement operations if she’s elected next month.
Sherrill’s proposal comes amid a national debate over immigration officers concealing their identities during enforcement actions, which have increased sharply under the second Trump administration. Speaking after an unrelated event in Newark Monday, Sherrill didn’t delve into details, but said her plan would mirror legislation she supports in Congress. 
“I heard from one police officer who said that somebody came into his town and, as he put it, was looking like he was dressed for Afghanistan and refused to identify himself,” she said, repeating a story she’s told numerous times on the campaign trail. “So that’s unacceptable. We need to know who is on our streets here in New Jersey.”
Dem lawmakers come to Mikie Sherrill’s aid in her bid to become NJ governor

The bill in Congress, sponsored by Democrats, would ban Department of Homeland Security agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement from wearing non-tactical masks and from obstructing their agency identification. It has not been heard by any committee in the GOP-led House.
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, called attempts to ban masked federal law enforcement a danger to officers. She claimed federal law enforcement officers have seen a 1,000% increase in assaults against them and have been targeted online through doxing.
“To be crystal clear: we will not abide by a state’s unconstitutional ban,” McLaughlin said about Sherrill’s proposal.
Sherrill’s past comments criticizing ICE agents wearing masks generally came in response to questions from reporters about her support for the Immigrant Trust Directive, a statewide order that restricts when local, county, and state police can cooperate with ICE agents. She hasn’t said whether she would keep the directive in place if she’s elected to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy (D) on Nov. 4.
Ron Chen, a law professor at Rutgers Law School, said a state law barring ICE agents from wearing masks would likely wind up in court and be struck down. Chen noted that state governments are prohibited from regulating federal agencies.
“Trying to regulate directly a federal law enforcement officer and the conduct of their duties — as much as it may be a good policy — I don’t think that’s something she would be able to do, period,” he said.
Since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up its efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. With federal agents conducting immigration raids often wearing plain clothes and without identifying themselves, Democratic lawmakers and attorneys general nationwide have said wearing masks compounds the “fear and chaos” of the raids. Critics have also cited the potential for impostors claiming to be ICE agents. 
Chen said the most likely outcome of a state mask ban for ICE agents is that courts would find it’s preempted under the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which limits state governments from overruling federal law. The governor could bar state and local police from wearing masks, but not federal agents, he said.
Chen noted that we have a very recent case highlighting how difficult it is for states to issue regulations on immigration-related matters. In July, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling striking down a New Jersey law that barred private entities from contracting with the federal government to house immigrant detainees.
Sherrill said if needed, she’d be prepared to “fight it out in court.”
Her support for banning masked federal agents comes one month after California banned most law enforcement from covering their faces during operations, including federal immigration agents. The law goes into effect Jan. 1. New York lawmakers have introduced a similar bill.
Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s GOP opponent, has not commented on her remarks criticizing ICE agents wearing masks. But Ciattarelli has expressed support for deporting people who are in the country illegally and said local law enforcement should be able to aid in immigration enforcement.

WASHINGTON — Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.
Rather, states should submit applications that “rebuild and reshape” how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at Washington, D.C.’s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors’ office staffers and state health agency leaders — some from as far away as Hawaii.
“This isn’t a backfill of operating budgets,” said Sutton, CMS’ innovation director. “We’ve been really clear on that.”
Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill’s financial fallout for rural hospitals.
Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency’s leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.
It’s “what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,” said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.
Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.
Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state’s rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” objectives.
The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as “symptom checkers and AI chatbots.”
In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money “will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.”
Smaller hospitals fear they will get “a tiny little slice” of each state’s share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.
“There’s a lot of frustration,” Felder said.
But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina’s secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet “is really just throwing good money after bad.” In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.
One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.
The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.
“They’re doing their job, and they’re talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,” Schneider said. “We’re one of many in that position.”
KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was “unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.”
Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program “will help states and communities reimagine what’s possible for rural healthcare.”
Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn’t “sexy” or “revolutionary.”
“If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don’t think that’s transformational,” Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.
Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money — including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating “SWAT” teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.
More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 — a statistic cited by CMS’ Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.
State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.
“We will train them in the scoring criteria,” Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from “your state” and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.
States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.
In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.
“It’s one-time money, and it’s a little bit of money,” said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.
“How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?” Mark said.
Neither Montana nor Wyoming — vast, rural states — sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.
Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were “stretched with other commitments.” Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.
During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.
“I think Arkansas’ application is going to be better than yours,” seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.
The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee’s Bill Lee.
“See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,” Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, “I look forward to us both winning.”

Lawmakers are hoping instead that legislation enacted in May will make it easier for farm fuel users and haulers of agricultural goods to receive the fuel exemption […],"A combine at work in wheat fields in the Walla Walla region, during 2018. (Washington State Department of Agriculture)Washington quietly ended funding this summer for a program that provided millions of dollars in rebates to farmers who paid unfair fuel surcharges under Washington’s landmark climate law.
Lawmakers are hoping instead that legislation enacted in May will make it easier for farm fuel users and haulers of agricultural goods to receive the fuel exemption promised under the state’s cap-and-trade system.
This year’s law directed the Department of Ecology to create an online map of retailers who sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that excludes any surcharges associated with the Climate Commitment Act.
Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake, said this will simplify the process for farmers and haulers. Rather than pay a surcharge and submit paperwork to the government for a rebate, they can avoid extra costs up front, at the pump, he said.
“This should be an easier way for farmers to not pay a surcharge,” Dent said. 
Complicated carveout
Central to the Climate Commitment Act are auctions for pollution allowances that refineries and other companies need to buy to offset their carbon emissions. 
Under the law, the agricultural, maritime and aviation sectors are supposed to be exempt from the law’s cap on emissions and any fees fuel companies might pass to customers to cover the cost of buying the allowances. Fuel used for trucking crops and other agricultural goods on public highways is exempt as well.
Soon after the cap-and-trade program began in 2023, complaints about these exemptions started streaming in.
There were difficulties tracking whether diesel fuel was being used for exempt purposes. A process where exempt fuel buyers had to present certificates to fuel sellers was cumbersome and faulty. One challenge for farmers was knowing where fuel exemption certificates would be accepted.
Bottom line, farmers and truckers said fuel distributors were, in many cases, passing on the cost of allowances to the tune of as much as 70 cents a gallon.
Ecology put together a workgroup that met several times in 2023 to try — unsuccessfully, said farmers and truckers — to iron out the wrinkles.
Even before the panel completed its work, the Washington Trucking Associations and the Washington Farm Bureau were asking a judge to scrap Ecology regulations guiding the exemptions and to open a new rulemaking process.
That fight reached the state Supreme Court this week.
Funding left out of budget
In 2024, the Legislature set aside $30 million for rebates to farm fuel users and transporters of agricultural goods who could show they paid a surcharge tied to the climate law for which they should have been exempt. The Department of Licensing ran the Agriculture Support Program with funding from Climate Commitment Act proceeds.
It launched in August 2024 and ended June 30 this year. 
Farmers and transporters could seek rebates for fuel purchased between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2024. A total of 2,744 applications came in, with $7,887,820 in rebates awarded, according to the Department of Licensing. There were rebate recipients in each of the state’s 39 counties.
Overall, the department spent $9.4 million on the rebate program, with the remaining $20.6 million returned to the climate fund.
Dent said he wanted the rebate program to continue, “but budget writers being budget writers decided not to do so.”
House Bill 1912, which Dent authored this year, says it is the intent of the Legislature to extend the rebate program through the 2025-27 biennium. That is not what occurred, even though the bill passed by margins of 94-2 in the House and 49-0 in the Senate.
The House penciled in $3 million to keep the program going in its budget, but the Senate put no funds in its version. That is what the Legislature passed and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed.
As a result, applications for rebates closed June 2. All those received were processed, with money sent by June 30.
In the meantime, the Department of Ecology developed the new online directory of retailers who have told the department that they sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that is different from fuel that is not exempt under the climate law.
This directory lists the name, address, county, and, if applicable, city of each exempt retail fuel seller. If additional retailers self-report, the site will be updated.
Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.
“The work is not over with,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/combine-walla-walla-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-10-21 07:16:41.203830

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s child care system serves as critical support for the state’s economy. It is also under enormous strain.
Wait lists, caps on enrollment for vulnerable children, an end to child care referral supports, and cuts to reimbursement rates further erode the shoreline on which Hoosiers’ economic house is built.
If, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation has estimated, Indiana misses out on over $4 billion annually in economic activity due to our child care deficiencies, we are poised to lose more in the coming years.
A recent survey from Early Learning Indiana found that providers are reporting enrollment declines, and more than three-fourths of providers have seen funding cuts for Child Care and Development Fund vouchers, the state’s largest child care subsidy for low-income households.


Others signing on to this commentary are:
– Mary Jane Eisenhauer, Executive Director, First Things First, Porter County

– Lakshmi Hasanadka, CEO, Indiana After School Network

– Hanan Osman, Executive Director, Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children

– Allie Sutherland, Executive Director, Northeast Indiana Early Childhood Coalition


Let’s be clear: These enrollment declines are not about reduced demand. They reflect a lack of support for families who need child care to work as well as wage growth that continues to lag inflation. Families still need care, and in many parts of our state demand exceeds supply. But affordability remains a crisis point for Indiana’s working families at all income levels.
Not investing in our state’s child care system – and in fact disinvesting in that system – comes at a cost.
Nearly a quarter of child care providers surveyed by Early Learning Indiana said they plan to cut services because of financial insecurity: from closing one classroom to shuttering their entire program.
These cuts create a perfect storm that jeopardizes care for all, not only those families who receive a voucher. Indiana’s families cannot afford these losses, and Indiana’s employers cannot afford to lose workers who will be sidelined because they can’t get child care.
Child care providers — and the families they serve — will feel the impact come October, when the state’s reimbursement rate cuts go into effect.
We acknowledge the real economic headwinds facing the state and do not envy the choices that have to be made to balance budgets or make sure public programs remain viable. But we also believe the state has an obligation and an opportunity to lead in ensuring Hoosiers have the resources they need to survive and thrive.
We need more voices at the table in setting child care policy; more ways to end waitlists for child care vouchers; and to create provider reimbursement rates that reflect the true costs of care and the genuine ability of families to pay. Families need, and deserve, these investments.
Families and employers count on child care to support economic opportunities and community stability. We need government partners to renew their commitments to the child care sector and the children it serves.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Indiana is asking the federal government for permission to overhaul how it spends and tracks billions in education aid — a request that Hoosier officials said would align the state’s accountability system with federal law and allow more freedom in how schools use their funds.
The request, submitted Friday to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, seeks a waiver from multiple provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, the federal law governing K-12 education.

If approved, the changes would take effect beginning in the 2026-27 school year.
State education leaders framed the proposal as an effort to “prioritize student learning over federal bureaucracy.” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said the state’s message to federal officials was clear. 
“With the opportunity to return education back to the states, we had a clear choice to make in Indiana: continue with the status quo or seize this moment to gain the flexibilities needed to remove federal barriers to more urgently move the needle for students,” Jenner said in a Monday statement. “As a state, we are leaning in to seize this moment, and today, our message to Washington is clear: Indiana is ready and eager, so give us the flexibility to keep driving forward for Indiana students.”
Gov. Mike Braun also praised the move, calling it proof that “Indiana continues to lead the nation in education and innovation.” 
“We can best support Hoosier students when we return education to the states, empower parents with high-quality educational options, get red tape out of the way for educators, and focus on improvement for every student,” he said in a news release.
Streamlining federal programs into one ‘block grant’
The 19-page waiver application outlines a plan to simplify how federal dollars are administered and to align Indiana’s accountability system with federal requirements. 
The state’s proposal centers on four main areas of flexibility: streamlining federal funding, easing local compliance, creating an innovation fund, and unifying accountability metrics.
In its filing, the Indiana Department of Education asked to combine funding from more than 15 federal education programs — including portions of Titles I, II, III and IV — into a single “strategic block grant.”
Those programs make up the bulk of federal K-12 aid: Title I supports schools serving higher percentages of low-income students; Title II funds teacher training and professional development; Title III provides extra assistance for English language learners; and Title IV helps schools expand “well-rounded” education programs, boost safety initiatives and increase access to technology.
Story continues below.
Indiana ESEA Flexibility Request w. Cover Letter
 
Indiana officials argued that managing those programs separately consumes significant time and resources. The waiver emphasized that IDOE currently spends about $2.2 million annually in staff time to support the administrative infrastructure required to meet ESEA compliance demands, with roughly 75% of that amount — about $1.7 million — dedicated solely to compliance and reporting rather than to initiatives that directly advance student achievement.
By consolidating those programs, officials said the state agency can redirect resources toward its top priorities, like early literacy, STEM education and high school redesign. 
The filing compares Indiana’s management of the federal COVID-era ESSER relief funds, which the department described as a “more efficient” block grant model that allowed it to “move with urgency” and “align resources with its most pressing educational priorities.”
The waiver additionally seeks to extend similar flexibility to school districts by allowing them to merge multiple federal grants into a single plan. 
Department officials argued that the change would simplify paperwork and monitoring, reducing what they describe as a “burdensome regulatory environment” that often discourages “innovation” at the local level. 
Under the new system, districts would complete one consolidated application and monitoring process, rather than separate plans for each federal program. That streamlined process would “free up time and staff to focus on what matters most: effective implementation, real-time progress monitoring, and continuous improvement,” according to the waiver.
Rethinking how school improvement funds are used
A major component within the request is the creation of a new “Education Innovation Grant” to replace the current federal School Improvement Grant structure. 
State officials said the change is needed to address long-term underperformance in some schools. The department cited national and state data showing that despite years of federal investment, many schools identified for improvement under ESEA remain among the lowest-performing. 
“Students and families cannot wait — sometimes for years — for a chronically underperforming school to improve,” the application urged. “(Grant flexibility) allows the money to support the child, rather than continuing to be trapped in a system that year over year is yielding negative results for children.”
Story continues below.
ESEA-Flex-Waiver-Overview
 
The proposed new approach would allow Indiana to direct about $25 million in annual federal school improvement funds to any district or program — such as charter schools, microschools, or partnerships with industry or higher education — that serves students zoned to attend persistently underperforming schools.
Hoosier officials argued that expanding eligibility would promote “student-centered solutions” and reduce the stigma associated with receiving federal school improvement dollars.
The state’s waiver also proposes aligning its new, forthcoming A–F accountability system with federal reporting requirements. Indiana officials say the move would end the confusion caused by schools currently receiving two different performance ratings—one for federal purposes and another under state law.
“This flexibility allows IDOE to tailor interventions to the state’s most urgent and localized needs,” the waiver notes, adding that a unified system would “provide families with clear, consistent school ratings to support informed decision-making” and “reduce complexity and increase clarity.”

The state would continue to publish annual report cards that break down outcomes by subgroup, but would shift how it packages and uses the funds behind those report cards.
Jenner described the request as part of a broader effort to “advance student outcomes through innovation, flexibility, and a relentless focus on academic excellence.”
In her cover letter for the waiver, she pointed to recent gains, including a five-percentage-point increase in third-grade literacy rates in 2025 and Indiana’s rise to sixth in the nation in fourth-grade reading scores. She also cited record-high graduation rates, improved math proficiency, and a reduction in chronic absenteeism since 2021.
The department emphasized that the waiver would not alter how federal funds are distributed to districts or change the “supplement, not supplant” requirement that ensures federal dollars enhance rather than replace state and local spending.
Teachers’ union urges caution
Federal education officials encouraged all states in July to consider ESEA waiver requests that would give them “more control” over how federal education dollars are used.
At least two states —Iowa and Oklahoma — have already similar flexibility requests.
But the Indiana State Teachers Association previously urged caution, arguing that the waiver could weaken oversight and divert resources away from schools that need them most.
In an Aug. 18 statement, ISTA leadership said it supports efforts to reduce administrative burden “when it can be done without undermining educational equity or outcomes for students,” but warned that consolidating federal programs “risks weakening” the rights of educators and parents to participate in decisions about federal funding.

The state’s largest teachers union also raised concerns that shifting school-improvement dollars “away from public schools identified for additional support … to other entities such as microschools, charter schools, or partnerships with industry or higher education institutions” could “redirect these funds to schools or programs that are not necessarily serving the students most in need.”
Still, at the July 16 State Board of Education meeting, IDOE senior official Ron Sandlin previewed the proposal and described it as a “continuation of Indiana’s commitment to innovation.” 
Sandlin told board members the flexibility waiver “is not about reducing accountability or transparency,” but rather “about aligning systems so we can spend more time serving students and less time checking boxes.” 
He said the plan is designed to “reduce bureaucratic compliance, empower local decision-making, and eliminate duplicative systems by adopting a single accountability framework for both state and federal requirements.”
Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Education has 120 days to review Indiana’s submission and provide a response. If approved, the changes would take effect beginning with the 2026–27 school year.
“The opportunity to return education to the states,” Jenner wrote in her letter, “allows us to further reduce burdensome federal compliance demands and empower our local leaders, in collaboration with parents and families, to make informed decisions about what Indiana students need most.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democrats see Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District as one of their best chances to flip a Republican seat next year, and six candidates have already launched campaigns to take on U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach — the latest being Dr. Nila Devanath, a hospital physician who announced her bid Tuesday.
The district, anchored in Hampton Roads and stretching across the cities of Virginia Beach, Suffolk, Franklin, parts of Chesapeake and the Eastern Shore, has traded hands several times over the past decade and remains highly competitive. 
Kiggans, a former state senator and Navy veteran, flipped the seat from Democrat Elaine Luria in 2022 and narrowly won reelection last year against Missy Cotter Smasal. 
But with President Donald Trump back in the White House, Democrats now view her as one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the House — particularly amid the ongoing federal government shutdown that’s hit her military-heavy district hard.
“The 2nd District is probably the second most competitive district in Virginia, after the 7th District in the Fredericksburg area,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. 
“The way the lines are drawn they provide an advantage to a Republican, but not an overwhelming one in a midterm election where opposition to the president is particularly intense. Democrats have an opportunity, and that’s why there’s so many candidates thinking about competing in this race next year.”
 A competitive coastal swing seat

The district’s large population of veterans, shipyard workers and federal employees makes it especially sensitive to Washington gridlock.
The seat has swung back and forth repeatedly. Democrat Luria won it in 2018 and 2020 before losing to Kiggans in 2022 by just over three points.  That pattern — narrow GOP victories in presidential years and Democratic surges in midterms — keeps the district near the top of both parties’ target lists. The Cook Political Report rates it a toss-up, and national Democrats have already signaled it as a top pickup opportunity.
A physician and former attorney who grew up in Hampton Roads, Devanath became the sixth Democrat to enter the race this week. The daughter of immigrants, she said her campaign is rooted in her experience caring for patients who struggle to access affordable treatment.

“In our hospitals, I see every day what happens when Washington fails to act,” Devanath said in her announcement. “Families wait months for care. Veterans are forced to split their pills in half. Patients with diabetes lose their lives avoiding treatment for something as simple as a small cut because they’re afraid of the medical bills that will follow.”
She added: “Rep. Jen Kiggans and I both swore to care for our patients, but in Washington she’s turned her back on that promise. As a doctor, I can’t stand by while families suffer. I’m running for Congress to fix this broken system for my patients, for our veterans, and for every family who deserves better.”
Before becoming a doctor, Devanath practiced law defending survivors of domestic violence at a legal-aid clinic. She now works as an acute-care physician serving veterans and active-duty families. Her campaign says she will focus on lowering health-care and housing costs, protecting Medicaid and ensuring veterans receive the care they’ve earned.
 Five Democrats already in

Devanath joins five other Democrats who have been campaigning for months — Patrick Mosolf, James Osyf, Nicolaus Sleister, Burk Stringfellow and Mike Williamson — each bringing a different background to the race.
Mosolf, a first-time candidate for Congress, is running on a platform of “restoring America’s democracy” and addressing cost-of-living issues ranging from housing to healthcare. 
Osyf, a commander in the Navy Reserve and first-generation Ukrainian American, announced his bid in July. He has served aboard the USS Norfolk and works for Lockheed Martin. His campaign emphasizes national security, veterans’ issues and restoring trust in government. 
Republicans have criticized Osyf for maintaining a residence in Washington, D.C., roughly three hours from the district, a charge his campaign dismissed as a distraction.
Sleister, a military spouse and community advocate, entered the race in April. He grew up in a working-class family that faced layoffs and frequent moves and later worked in homeland-security and physical-security leadership. Sleister focuses on economic stability and affordability for families.
Stringfellow, a teacher and project manager active in the nonpartisan RepresentUs movement, also filed his paperwork in April. He advocates for government reform, ranked-choice voting and economic justice.
Williamson, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and father of two who now lives in Suffolk, has also entered the Democratic primary in the 2nd District. He served 20 years in the Marines, including six overseas tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa and Asia, as well as assignments at the Pentagon and with NATO in Hampton Roads.
Williamson says his mission is to bring service-era discipline and integrity to Congress.
 Incumbent under pressure

Kiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot and nurse practitioner, has portrayed herself as a pragmatic conservative focused on military families and the economy, but Democrats argue her record tells a different story.
Earlier this year, Kiggans voted for a Republican budget package that included deep cuts to Medicaid — reductions that could total $625 billion nationwide over a decade and threaten hospital funding across the state. 
Her opponents have also pointed to her votes against renewing Affordable Care Act subsidies without an alternative, which analysts said would raise premiums for roughly 300,000 Virginians.
The ongoing shutdown has added to the political pressure. With thousands of federal workers and contractors in the region facing furloughs, local officials warned of ripple effects on small businesses and defense operations. 
Kiggans said she supported a “clean continuing resolution” but also blamed Senate Democrats for stalling broader budget talks.
 High stakes for both parties

The 2nd District’s competitiveness gives it outsize importance in the battle for control of the U.S. House. Republicans hold a narrow majority, and both national campaign committees are already targeting the race. 
The DCCC has placed Kiggans on its “Red-to-Blue” list of vulnerable incumbents, while the NRCC has moved to defend her seat.
Republican candidates representing districts that are not overwhelmingly Republican have a big challenge when it comes to defending some of Trump’s policies, said Farnsworth, the political scientist. 
“In the 2nd District, where there’s a relatively high level of federal employment, the federal government cutbacks and the government shutdown do not particularly endear swing voters to Republicans backing the president,” Farnsworth said. 
Whoever wins the June 16, 2026, Democratic primary, will face an incumbent in November of next year with a formidable fundraising network and a message rooted in service — but also a district increasingly restless with partisan brinkmanship.
With the shutdown dragging on and cost-of-living and health care issues dominating local headlines, Democrats are betting that Virginia’s 2nd District — long a weathervane for Hampton Roads politics — might once again shift their way.

The symposium takes place Thursday to Saturday at Mississippi University for Women and is free to the public.
Jones is Alabama’s first Black poet laureate, holding the post from 2022 until next year. She will present her new poetry collection, “Lullaby for the Grieving,” which is inspired by her father’s death and deals with themes of grief, family and heritage.
“I hope the audience hears my humanity, and I hope they take a moment to consider how vital it is right now to hold that truth – our shared humanity – very close,” Jones said.
The symposium is named after Mississippi author Welty, who attended MUW, which was then called Mississippi State College for Women. This year’s theme, “Secrets and Revelations: A Dark Thread Running Through My Story,” is inspired by Welty’s novel “Losing Battles.”
Among the presenters are the winners of the symposium’s two writing competitions – the Welty Prize and the Eudora Welty Ephemera Prize for High School Creative Writing.
The Welty Prize honors works of scholarship. Winners get their manuscript published by the University Press of Mississippi and $2,000 from the university.
This year’s Welty Prize winner is drea brown, a professor of English at Texas State University who does not capitalize their name. Their manuscript, “Conjuring the Haint: The Haunting Poetics of Black Women,” looks into “the intimacies of haunting and grief in Black women’s lived experiences and literary productions.”

“I hope that folks can hold the complexity of ghosts, of grief and fullness of Black women’s humanity,” brown wrote.
The Ephemera Prize goes to five high school students, who receive $200 and lunch with other authors at the symposium.
T. Kris Lee is the symposium’s acting director and professor of English/creative writing at MUW. He said the Ephemera prize has many benefits for young writers.
“It affirms the value of these young voices, so often full of fresh perspectives, creativity and emotional honesty,” he said. “By placing their work beside established voices, a very real sense of validation is given to their ideas and experiences, showing that youth voices matter in broader conversations.”
The university will host 12 authors, including several from Mississippi. Poets Kendall Dunkelberg, Olivia Clare Friedman and Samyak Shertok will share their work. Joining them are Robert Busby, who published a collection of stories about a fictional town in north Mississippi; Addie E. Citchens, who published a novel set in a fictional town in the Mississippi Delta; and Lauren Rhoades, who published a memoir about her interfaith family.
Lee said he looks forward to seeing all the writers present their work.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As a clean energy business leader, I’m concerned about the escalating energy costs hitting Americans nationwide. I’ve led numerous projects that have helped balance demand from the energy grid and put cheap, clean energy up in southeast Minnesota communities. We are facing an energy crisis created by President Trump and Republicans in Congress. Despite repeated promises to lower prices, President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has repealed clean, affordable energy tax credits, a move that will raise energy prices and stifle innovation.
It didn’t have to be this way. A solution to meet increasing energy demand and lower energy rates that was working — but now,we are experiencing what I call the Republican Rate Hike.
Since 2022, clean energy tax credits have created hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs and helped us meet the rising energy demands driven by extreme heat, AI, and data centers. This investment was the solution to rising prices. The Republican bill that passed this year, however, is stalling clean energy production and canceling projects, costing America more than 80,000 clean energy jobs that have already been lost or delayed since Trump’s election. The majority of the 400,000 new clean energy jobs announced since August 2022 are in Republican congressional districts, yet these Republicans refused to stand up to their constituents in the process.
We are already seeing the consequences. Americans are getting hit with higher gas and electric bills: Nearly 60 electric and gas utilities are raising or trying to raise utility bills for 56.7 million electric customers and 26 million gas customers this year. In fact, rising electricity prices have outpaced inflation, increasing 10% since Trump took office.
One in every six U.S. households is behind on their electric or gas bills, and as of March, customers owed gas and electric utilities more than $24 billion in late payments. A study from Energy Innovation projected that this tax bill alone could increase cumulative household energy costs by $170 billion from 2025 to 2034.
The problem is compounded by policies that are creating uncertainty and raising costs across all sectors. The fact is, oil and gas alone cannot meet the current demand. Solar, wind and battery storage accounted for over 90% of all new American energy supply in 2024. Despite the president’s plan to increase production, oil companies have stated they will not boost activities unless they can raise prices even higher.
The United States is now in an energy crisis that was completely avoidable. Imagine a climber nearing the top of a deep well, only for someone to cut the rope just as they are about to reach safety. Trump and congressional Republicans are the ones who cut the rope that was our only way out of this hole.
Clean energy companies will continue to do our part to power American innovation, but we need government leaders who recognize the growing energy crisis and take action to address it, rather than making it worse. Clean energy is now the cheapest energy in the world. Leaning into clean energy means lowering energy bills faster.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,,,2025-10-21 10:17:05.247104

Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, right, speaks during the Monday meeting of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform. while the chairman, state Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, far left, looks on (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The most popular idea for controlling property tax bills, the chairman of a Missouri House committee said Monday, is to set a separate tax rate for each of four types of property subject to the annual adjustments required in the state Constitution.
Since June, the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform has been holding hearings around the state and discussing legislation it could propose to quiet outrage over rapidly rising residential tax bills. One of the most popular ideas, said the chairman, Republican state Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, is to “silo” the four types of property — agricultural, commercial, personal and residential — so increases in assessed value in one subclass are not diluted by stagnant values in another.
“If one spikes and the others don’t, it’s watered down, so (the rollback) doesn’t take effect,” Taylor said during a hearing Monday to discuss possible legislation. “So the goal is to get them in their own little category.”
Support for walling off the various classes of property is coming from officials, the public and the State Tax Commission, Taylor said to reporters after the meeting. 
“Of all things that we discussed, not only is that coming from us, but from the people, and from the tax commission itself,” Taylor said. “That, in itself, can potentially fix a lot of issues that we’re seeing across the state.”’
The special committee was created in June after lawmakers passed a hastily crafted bill to cap tax bills in 97 counties. It follows several years of public upset over rapidly increasing assessments intended to bring taxable values in line with market values. 
The speed at which the bill was written and passed is something that Taylor said has to be fixed. In 75 counties, tax bills are not allowed to increase more than 5% per year from a base amount, or by the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. The provision, Taylor said, was supposed to be whichever in less.
In 22 others, no increase in the tax bill would be allowed.There are exceptions built in for newly voted levies and the additional value from improvements.
Many of the larger counties of the state, including Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis, were excluded altogether from the legislation.
Taylor told the committee he intends to have a bill drafted with nearly a dozen ideas that have been raised in the hearings or come from legislation in past years. House Speaker Jon Patterson wants the bill to be ready when the next regular session opens in January, he said.
Along with walling off subclasses of property, ideas that will be in Taylor’s bill include:

Requiring all local tax elections to be on November ballots when turnout is highest.
Allowing local governments to enact additional sales taxes to replace or reduce property taxes.
Making debt levies subject to the Constitution’s rollback provisions.
Wording ballot descriptions so the impact of new or renewed tax levies is stated as the cost per $100,000 of assessed value instead of the cost per $100 of value, which is the current method.

Not every idea will be as popular as siloing property classes, Taylor said.
“It’s my responsibility to try to put something together,” he said. “And again, the speaker said, ‘I’d like a big, beautiful bill,’ so we’ll see what we can do.”
The committee’s ranking Democrat, state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, also had a list of ideas she had crafted with input from other Democrats on the committee. Her list calls for homebuyers to file statements of the price of their new property — called a certificate of value — with assessors when homes change hands.
That idea did not make Taylor’s list. There are things Democrats on the committee would like to see but haven’t had a chance to discuss, Steinhoff added.
“There’s other things that we’re very interested in, but we don’t think we’ve really hashed out in committee a clear understanding of it,” she said.
State Sen. Rusty Black of Chillicothe discusses on Monday the work of the School Funding Modernization Task Force, which he chairs, with the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The biggest portion of any property tax bill is the levy for local schools. At the same time the committee is studying property taxes, a separate commission — the School Funding Modernization Task Force — has been meeting to decide on how state support should supplement local tax revenue.
Part of Monday’s hearing was set aside to hear from state Sen. Rusty Black, a Chillicothe Republican who is chairing the school funding panel. He said his task force will be watching closely so its report, due in December 2026, is based on the tax base available at the time.
“The two decisions intertwine,” Black said. “Watching what comes out of here and what kind of things start to have some traction is going to be very important as the task force continues to meet, and possibly come up with a plan to give to the governor.”
The idea of siloing the types of property is growing in popularity because of the way taxes are adjusted after the biennial reassessment. Commercial and agricultural property taxes are tied to productivity and potential to produce income, while the values of homes and vehicles are tied to the price the property would bring in the market.
Under the Missouri Constitution’s Hancock Amendment, when the value of property in a taxing district grows faster than inflation, rates are supposed to be reduced. But when one class of property is increasing faster than others, the effect is a smaller rollback than if the class of property had its own rate.
While the idea of siloing property classes is popular, there is little consensus among the committee’s 20 members on other changes that should be made, Taylor said. 
“If you could get 20 people to all agree on any one thing,” Taylor said, “it would be a miracle.”

Providers and advocates are trying to prepare for potential changes to how insurance may cover gender-affirming care.   
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal moves to block health care for trans youth may complicate access in Vermont.","This is the second story in a two-part series looking at health care available to transgender youth in Vermont. The first story “Vermont positioned to become gender-affirming care haven for New Hampshire families” can be found here. 

Step by step, since the start of his second term, the administration of President Donald Trump has moved to use insurance programs overseen by the federal government as a tool for blocking gender-affirming care for minors nationwide. 
It started with a presidential executive order in January that declared the new policy of the United States would be that the government “will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist or support” youth transitioning “from one sex to another.” Since then, blocking minors from accessing the broad suite of care that falls under the umbrella of gender-affirming care, like hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers, or gender-affirming surgery, has become a focus for both political rhetoric and activity by federal agencies. 
While people look to Vermont as a place buffered from the fallout of federal attacks on healthcare for transgender youth, advocates and providers in the state remain on high alert in order to maintain access to that care. State law does protect health care providers and requires that people not be denied care because of their gender identity. But federal rules, particularly governing insurance coverage, may make that more complicated.
Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate, stressed that although the atmosphere feels more fraught now, people should know that access to gender-affirming care for minors remains available in Vermont. 
“Vermont law is clear on legally protected care,” he said. “At least in today’s legal landscape, the status quo is maintaining.” 
In Vermont, most young people can access this kind of care through UVM Medical Center’s Transgender Youth Program. PlannedParenthood of Northern New England and other providers or therapists also offer some of the services that fall into gender-affirming care’s wide net. At UVMMC, patients can meet with a clinician to receive hormonal interventions, like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy. For surgeries, the hospital refers patients out of state.
Vermont has strong shield laws that protect those who provide and receive gender-affirming care from threats or civil or criminal charges from another state. The shield laws also classify gender-affirming care as an essential part of healthcare that in-state health insurance plans must cover. 
So even as the Trump administration tries to unravel access to gender-affirming care, Vermont’s existing state law requires that this access remain in place. 
Essential healthcare
A major player in the Trump administration’s efforts is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees and funds, entirely or in part, the operations of both federal insurance programs. The agency also sets regulations that govern the private insurance markets and subsidies put in place by the Affordable Care Act. 
Through official communication and rulemaking, leaders at CMS have tried to enact new policy through the leverage of their control over more than $2 trillion in Americans’ health care spending.

This June, CMS finalized a set of rule changes that made it more difficult to access many types of care under plans bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. One of those changes allows private insurers selling plans on the market to not cover gender-affirming care by removing it from the list of “essential health benefits.” Those are the package of benefits that all ACA marketplace plans are required to cover. So insurance companies are not prevented from covering this care, but they are no longer required to do so. 
In July, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined 20 states in a lawsuit challenging the rule.
“The Trump Administration cannot violate the law, and we will fight attempts to roll back coverage for Vermonters, including any attempt to take away coverage for gender-affirming care under the ACA,” Clark said in a July press release at the time. 
Vermont’s anti-discrimination law, though, prohibits insurers from discriminating against covering this care. Functionally, it ensures that in-state insurance companies keep this care protected.

Vermont is one of five states, alongside California, Colorado, New Mexico and Washington, which the federal rule identifies as specifically including coverage for some gender-affirming care as part of the marketplace insurance standard. 
Jason Williams, who leads UVM Medical Center’s external communications, said that the hospital is tracking how private insurance covers hormone replacement therapy — or doesn’t. 
Some private insurers have prematurely ended coverage for this gender-affirming care, Williams said. For employer-sponsored insurance plans, the state has no power to tell a company to cover the drugs, since those plans are managed federally.
For one Washington County family, the uncertainty of coverage for gender-affirming care has already become a reality: When Michelle, whose last name VTDigger is not using to protect her family’s privacy, took her daughter for hormone injections in July, their insurance covered it. On Oct. 6, she was denied coverage by her primary insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. Her secondary insurance, Vermont Medicaid, followed suit because her primary denied it. The insurer has since denied the appeal she filed, Michelle said. She cannot afford the cost of the hormones without insurance, and thus, her daughter is switching to a different type.

Gina Brittain, communications and marketing manager for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont, did not comment on this case specifically, but told VTDigger that “Blue Cross Vermont maintains its longstanding medical policy to support gender affirming care. This support extends to members under the age of 18 who meet the medical necessity and documentation requirements outlined within our Gender Affirming Services Corporate Medical Policy.” 
Medicaid rules
Many providers and advocates also worry about other pathways the Trump administration may take to pull back insurance coverage for gender-affirming care.
In particular, they worry about how CMS is targeting state Medicaid agencies’ coverage of the care for minors. In April, federal regulators sent a letter to the state agencies who operate Medicaid warning that “growing evidence” shows gender-affirming care for minors should not be covered by the insurance program. Yet, Vermont law requires its Medicaid program to do so.

If CMS were to finalize rules that withhold federal Medicaid funds from being used for gender-affirming care, Vermont Medicaid would need to use state funds to cover that care, explained Monica Allard, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Vermont. The costs of covering this care would be relatively small, she added.
“The disruption of funding itself doesn’t disrupt the obligation to provide the care,” Allard said. “A change to the rules around Medicare and Medicaid funding would only mean that the funds would need to come from a new source, not that it would be illegal to provide that care.”
The biggest concern, however, for Williams at UVM Medical Center and others, came in the form of a rule title briefly posted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website in August. 
CMS regularly issues rules called “conditions of participation.” These are standards the federal government says a health care provider must meet in order to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. If a hospital or a clinic doesn’t meet those conditions, it cannot bill or receive funding for any services to Medicare or Medicaid patients. It disqualifies a provider from billing the program for even the most routine of check-ups. 
The proposed rule that CMS posted would disqualify providers from participating in Medicare or Medicaid entirely if they are also providing gender-affirming care to minors. Though just a title was published and the rule has not been officially written, the chill it has left for providers remains.
“At the end of the day, we can expect that this is going to be included [as a proposed rule].” Williams said.
But the hospital’s leaders also predict that there could be a long lag between when the rule is proposed and when it will be actually implemented. Once CMS proposes a rule, the Office of Management and Budget reviews it and a public comment period opens. 
“We can also expect that it’s going to be litigated, and there’s a good chance that there will be judicially-issued pauses,” Williams said. “When something [does] come out, if something comes up, the words are really going to matter.” 
For instance, much of the language the federal government has used to target trans health care has focused on surgical care, which UVM Medical Center already does not provide for minors, though it does for adults. 
Ultimately, if the condition does come to pass, “the implications far exceed gender-affirming care,” Williams said. Nearly two-thirds of the patients the medical center sees receive Medicare and Medicaid. A condition restricting a hospital from receiving CMS reimbursements would force it to choose between providing the entire range of care to that entire population of patients or gender-affirming therapy for minors. 
“If we wouldn’t be able to see [Medicare and Medicaid patients], that would spell the end for any health system,” Williams said.

Keeping care accessible
Even if the change in conditions of participation brought the end of gender-affirming care for minors at the state’s biggest hospital, it would not mean the end of the services in the state, said the ACLU’s Allard. 
“The Trump administration knows it doesn’t have the power to unilaterally ban gender-affirming care, so instead, it is trying to change the rules for receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding to threaten access to health care for everyone unless providers abandon trans youth,” she said. “Vermont’s responsibility to provide access to affordable gender-affirming health care would not change based on new federal Medicare and Medicaid rules,” she said. 
To cover the care, though, a new and separate funding source — and likely a new provider — would need to be set up and set aside, Allard said. That could mean a public-private partnership or a combination of Vermont state funds, private health insurance, philanthropy and patients self paying. Allard noted that Massachusetts, for instance, allocated funds for gender-affirming care in its fiscal year 2026 state budget.
Williams echoed these possibilities. “Is it a new organization that comes out of this? Is it an existing organization that doesn’t care about losing participation in Medicare or Medicaid?” he said. 
“The thing that will ensure care is able to be provided, (and) by what entity, really will be the support of our community,” Williams added. “If you can’t receive reimbursements from Medicare or Medicaid, then private sources of funding, like philanthropy, will have to ensure that whoever’s providing that care is able to continue to provide.”
Jessica Barquist, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of New England, noted that the provider already runs a donor-supported fund to help those who need it access and afford care.
If an institution — be it an insurer or the state itself — were to deny someone care because of their gender identity, it would be a violation of Vermont’s anti-discrimination laws, Allard added. She urged providers to resist pre-emptive or voluntary compliance with these federal impulses.  
“It’s completely likely and possible that a real change like this could be challenged and potentially halted,” she said. “Leaders in state government and health care institutions are, I think, aware, and should continue to be aware of the risks of preemptive compliance with these sort of questionable federal directives.”

Dana Kaplan, the director of LGBTQ+ resource organization Outright Vermont, said that his organization has been closely monitoring the actions coming out of the federal government. He said there has been a degree of confusion about what is legal and what is safe — and what will be accessible if federal actions do restrict access to care. 
“I think we’ve talked more to the Attorney General’s Office in Vermont this year than we have in any other year,” he said. The organization has also been in “deep communication” with leadership at UVM Medical Center to discuss how they can ensure that resources and services continue to reach the young people who need them “if the worst comes to bear,” he said.
Should that come to bear, Kaplan is clear that his community will play a strong role in building out its own alternatives and pathways to access care. “There’s a real question, which I think marginalized communities have held for decades, which is, ‘How do we create our own safety? How do we create our own care?’” he said.
Already queer advocacy groups are facing the reality of these federal changes hitting close to home. Just last week, the Pride Center of Vermont, which primarily supports adults in the LGBTQ+ community,  had to close its doors to service due to a loss of federal and state funding.  
For now, advocates and providers should continue to explore creative pathways and be ready to respond to the specific language of federal directives, Kaplan said. The most important thing, though, will be continuing to ensure that young people continue to receive the care they need, he said.
“I think that part of what we’re all trying to navigate right now is to shore up the practices and policies that we do have in place, or to figure out how to ensure that we’re not moving backwards in places where we have already made strides,” Kaplan said.

All we need to do is cut out the middleman by not renewing our state contracts with insurance corporations like Centene, Blue Cross and United Healthcare.
Over the past decade, the corporations running Medicaid nationally averaged an astronomical overhead rate of 13%. On top of that, Missouri spends untold millions of dollars overseeing these corporations.
All this waste disappears if we switch to an enhanced form of the fee-for-service model that Missouri Medicaid currently uses for our aged, blind and disabled people. Other states, such as Connecticut, have cut out the middleman and run their Medicaid programs with a total overhead of 4-6%. Since 2012, that tiny state has saved $4 billion.
Connecticut did this without a significant increase in state agency staffing by outsourcing much of the work to private commercial businesses called “Administrative Services Organizations” that are paid a flat fee for a defined service, avoiding the conflicts of interest inherent in so-called “managed care” organizations.
States like Missouri that allow insurance corporations to run their Medicaid program have consistently seen higher and more rapidly growing expenses. Between 2004 and 2015, counties that outsourced their Medicaid program to insurance corporations had their costs rise $1,584 per person per year above what was being spent in comparable counties that avoided this trap.
By switching to enhanced fee for service, we would have to absorb some of the administrative functions done by insurers, but we would also stop spending anything on insurance company overhead and oversight. On balance, we could expect a modest increase in administrative expenses but save between 10-17% of total costs.
In total, after accounting for the portion of savings that would go back to the federal government (they fund the majority of Medicaid), our state would save between 152 and 258 million dollars per year, in 2023 dollars.
We’re not the only state in this position. Nationwide deprivatization of Medicaid would annually save all states combined as much as $34 billion and the federal government as much as $43 billion, for a total of $77 billion for the country.
To be clear, that’s not enough to completely mitigate the recent federal cuts to Medicaid funding – but it would go a long way. Without this approach, we face a range of unpalatable alternatives.
We could instead cut the “optional” Medicaid benefits like pharmacy, dentistry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and hospice care. Sadly, many states facing a budget crisis decide to cut long-term home health services, a self-defeating strategy as these are the very services that keep people from being institutionalized at even higher costs to the state.
Or we could cut more people from Medicaid.
Or we could cut back on what we pay doctors, though many people on Medicaid already have difficulty finding a physician who accepts Missouri’s paltry Medicaid fee schedule.
Or we could cut back on what we pay hospitals, but Missouri already has too many hospitals at risk of closure. Cutting their funding would accelerate the crisis, particularly in rural communities.
Or we could reduce state funding for other essential services, like education.
Or we could raise taxes.
None of these choices are acceptable. Removing managed care organizations from Medicaid would protect the entire healthcare system while saving us hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
As striking as those numbers are, it’s not just about money. Removing the insurance industry’s barriers to care has been shown to attract more physicians into Medicaid, increase early diagnosis of cancer, and improve overall health.
I worry about people like my 31 year-old patient with juvenile diabetes who works as a self-employed roofer. Before Missouri expanded Medicaid, he frequently resorted to taking his insulin every other day. No physician wants to see people go back to rationing a life-saving medication.
The politics seem daunting, given the prominence of large insurance corporations in Missouri. But remember, Connecticut found a way to do this in 2012, and that state is often considered “the insurance capital of the world.”

(Photo by Mike Kropf/ via AP/pool)A U.S. district court judge has blocked enforcement of punitive measures against a pro-Palestinian nonprofit under investigation by Attorney General Jason Miyares.
In an Oct. 7 oral ruling and Oct. 17 written opinion, Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia said Miyares’ push to obtain donor lists from American Muslims for Palestine is overly broad and likely violates the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of association. 
The temporary injunction and restraining order blocks Richmond Circuit Court Judge Devika Davis’ Sept. 29 ruling holding the charity in contempt for not handing over its donor lists; Davis had ordered a $1,000 daily fine until AMP turned over the documents to the attorney general’s office.
Miyares vowed to appeal.
“Charitable organizations operating in Virginia have an obligation to follow the law,”  Miyares’ spokesperson Shaun Kenney said in a statement on Monday.

Brinkema’s ruling comes in the midst of a tight election between Miyares and Democrat Jay Jones. It’s not clear if Jones, whose campaign was upended by the revelation of incendiary text messages from 2022, will continue to prosecute the case if he wins; his spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
 The investigation

Miyares publicly announced his investigation into the group on Oct. 29, 2023, weeks after Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people and sparking an ongoing conflict that has left nearly 70,000 Palestinians dead and unleashed a humanitarian crisis.
In legal filings, press releases, and an appearance on Fox Business, Miyares accused AMP of failing to register with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. He also claimed funds raised by the group may have been funneled to “terrorist organizations,” without providing evidence to back the claim.  
In the Fox appearance, Miyares appeared to connect the group to Hamas.
“Hamas is a known terrorist organization, designated by the European Union and our United States government,” Miyares said. “So our job is to get to the truth.”
On its website, AMP says it aims to advance “the movement for justice in Palestine by educating the American public about Palestine.” The group described Miyares’ initial accusations as “defamatory and dangerous smear” and accused him of “attempting to score political points with hateful extremists.” 
Using a legal tool called a civil investigative demand, the attorney general’s office sought a range of documents, including rosters of the group’s employees, meeting minutes, banking documents, and lists of the group’s donors and members of its email lists.
Legal representatives for American Muslims for Palestine acknowledged they’d overlooked Virginia’s registration requirements and registered with the state in November 2023, turning over some of the documents demanded by Miyares’ office the following month.
But the fight over the donor lists has proved to be contentious. In July, the Virginia Court of Appeals rejected AMP’s petition to prevent immediate enforcement of Miyares’ demand, though it has yet to issue a ruling in the case and did not elaborate on its reasoning. In legal filings in September, the attorney general’s office accused AMP of embarking on a “meritless and lengthy campaign to evade, delay and obstruct” the OAG’s investigation and asked Judge Davis to sanction the group. 
AMP filed its federal petition on Sept. 26 asking the court to block enforcement of parts of Miyares’ demand until questions of its constitutionality were fully resolved. Brinkema held a hearing on Oct. 3 and made a ruling from the bench the same day granting their request. She also ordered AMP to post an $8,000 bond.
In her opinion, Brinkema argued that without the injunction, AMP would be forced to either pay hefty fines or turn over sensitive documents.
“Given AMP’s likelihood of succeeding on the merits of its free association claim, choosing this path would likely result in irreparable injury because once the AG has access to the donor lists, AMP cannot un-ring the bell, even if an appellate court later found that the demand for AMP’s donor lists was constitutionally infirm,” Brinkema said.
Christina Jump, AMP’s lead attorney on the case, said Miyares was attempting to force the group to hand over the documents before constitutional questions had been litigated — a move she said sent a chilling message to nonprofits and businesses.
“It’s the top legal officer for Virginia trying to sidestep the law,” Jump said.
 Pro-Israel politics

Miyares has made his support for Israel an important pillar of his political brand.
The Republican traveled to Israel twice in 2023, meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a March visit and, in November, visiting sites of the Oct. 7 attacks and speaking with survivors.
After opening probe of pro-Palestinian group, Virginia AG sends supplies to Israel

The attorney general’s office encouraged local law enforcement to donate surplus gear to Israel, inviting the press to observe helmets, vests and protective plates being loaded into a truck outside his office. He also sent a letter to the state’s higher education leaders encouraging them to “promote public safety and ensure viewpoint diversity” in the midst of student protests against the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
Miyares’ investigation against AMP comes as the group has faced at least five recent federal lawsuits that attempt to hold the group liable for the actions of pro-Palestinian protesters or Hamas. 
Those accusations have yet to be sustained in court. 
One case cited by Miyares, Boim v. American Muslims for Palestine, attempts to hold the group liable for Hamas’ murder of David Boim, claiming the group is an “alter ego” of a defunct nonprofit that a federal judge found liable for Boim’s death. The case has been litigated since 2017 and is in the discovery phase.
In another case, a group of survivors of the Oct. 7 attack as well as family and friends of the victims sued the group for allegedly violating U.S. terrorism laws and providing material support to Hamas. But Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. of the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the case, writing in an Aug. 15 opinion that the plaintiffs had failed to prove any connection between AMP and the attacks.
“Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege even prior knowledge of the October 7, 2023 attack, much less intentional aid that substantially furthered the tort,” Alston wrote.

Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, speaks during a news conference on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025, in Indianapolis. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus on Monday decried the likely harms of early redistricting on the state’s Black and other non-white voters.
“Mid-decade redistricting is unprecedented in Indiana,” Rep. Earl Harris Jr., the IBLC’s chair, told reporters. “It undermines the democratic process and threatens to silence voters, especially in communities of color.”
The news conference came as Indiana Republicans — and President Donald Trump — build support for redrawing the state’s blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Statehouse’s GOP supermajorities drew the current maps in 2021, using 2020 census data. District boundaries aren’t due for updates until after the 2030 census.
Republicans hold seven of the seats. Democrats have two.
“Both of these congressmen, not only were they elected, but they have been reelected, which tells you what the voters want,” Harris said of U.S. Reps. Frank Mrvan and André Carson. “Communities of color in Gary, Indianapolis and Fort Wayne make up more than half of Indiana’s Black population. Their voices are not optional.”

“Redistricting isn’t just a map-making exercise — it’s a power-shaping decision,” Harris, D-East Chicago, continued. “And when that power is manipulated, it’s communities of color (that) will pay the price in representation, in resources and in respect.”
Mrvan’s northwest district is the most competitive in Indiana.
But Carson’s Indianapolis-area seat is the state’s safest, according to the latest edition of the Cook Partisan Voting Index.
“Redrawing this district risks diluting Black voting power through tactics like ‘cracking,’ which splits communities across districts, and ‘packing,’ which concentrates minority voters to minimize their influence,” Harris said.
Although Indiana leans Republican, caucus members argued that Hoosier Democrats should still be represented in Congress.
“Indiana may get called red on election night, (but) there are a significant number of Democrats in the state of Indiana, and we need to make sure our congressional representation is proportional to the vote,” Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, said.
Almost 59% of Indiana voters went for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, according to the state’s results webpage. About 40% chose Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Two percent cast ballots for write-in, Libertarian or other minor party candidates.
IBLC members said they’re already preparing to take action if early redistricting goes forward — but declined to share details since “we’re still working out things,” according to Harris.
But mobilizing voters will be part of the response, said Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, who hoped high turnout could surmount new lines.
The caucus consists of more than a dozen Black lawmakers, most from the state House but some from the Senate. All are Democrats.

Anecdotal observations of whitetails using established elk and mule deer migration routes through the Absaroka Range are both interesting and concerning, biologist says.
The post Whitetail deer, not known for migration, spotted traversing Yellowstone region high country appeared first on WyoFile .","A state biologist who maintains a network of remote trail cameras along known ungulate migration routes in the Absaroka Mountains has been detecting a new cervid species that isn’t exactly known for making long-distance seasonal journeys.
It’s the whitetail deer.  
Images of whitetail have been collected well into the Washakie Wilderness backcountry, a ways from the nearest trailhead in the South Fork of the Shoshone River drainage. One of the cameras is even trained on an open ridge around 8,000 feet in elevation, where seeing a whitetail is especially perplexing. 
“These are on what we would consider true migration routes for mule deer and elk,” said Tony Mong, a Cody-based wildlife biologist for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “It’s the migration route that mule deer use to get into the Thorofare backcountry — it’s that route.”
Detections include adult whitetail, but also a spotted fawn — a sighting that infers reproduction in higher-elevation areas where the species hasn’t historically occurred.

Mong didn’t pick up any whitetail the first five years he maintained a trail camera network along the migration paths leading toward Yellowstone National Park and the Thorofare region. But in 2023, they began appearing —  during both the spring and fall migration seasons. The biologist emphasized that the detections have been sporadic and a tiny fraction of the overall number of animals using the routes. Nevertheless, he called their appearance “interesting and concerning.” 
“If we see it continue or see those numbers start to increase, it’s something that I would be concerned about,” Mong said. “But it’s kind of a weird anomaly right now.” 
The “interesting” element, he said, is how whitetail learned to do it. Migration in cervids like mule deer is a learned behavior passed from one generation to the next. 
Whitetail deer, in general, have been fanning out into the Bighorn Basin and other mountainous reaches of western Wyoming concurrent with a long-term decline in mule deer. While the species is considered native to parts of the state, like the whitetail-thick Black Hills, that’s not necessarily the case along the Yellowstone ecosystem’s eastern front.
“There are documents from Wyoming Game and Fish talking about moving whitetails into this portion of the state in the late ‘30s and into the ‘40s and ‘50s,” Mong said. “They were trying to create more hunting opportunities for guys when they were coming back from [World War II], because they’d have a big influx of hunters.” 
That history shapes how Mong sees and manages whitetail deer. Hunting seasons have been established to knock back the weedy newcomers. 
“I don’t hold [whitetail] in the same arena as mule deer here in the Yellowstone ecosystem,” Mong said. “We have very liberal doe harvest on whitetails within both the Upper Shoshone and the Clarks Fork herds — our main migratory Yellowstone mule deer herds.”

Wyoming biologists have also documented whitetail deer expanding into other high-elevation nooks of the Bighorn Basin. 
“They’re heading into the mountains almost everywhere you could think of,” said Corey Class, the wildlife management coordinator for Game and Fish’s Cody Region. “It’s pretty impressive, really.” 
As an example, Class cited Spruce Meadows, which is at almost 8,500 feet in elevation in the Ishawooa Creek drainage. Whitetails have also been seen near the top of Sunlight Basin, another Absaroka Range feature north of Cody.

Even in the higher-elevation mountains, whitetails still tend to be confined to creek bottoms and other riparian zones — the habitats where they’re typically found along valley floors. 
Although migratory whitetail that head into the Absarokas is a newer phenomenon for state biologists, it’s a behavior that the species is capable of. Minnesota whitetails sometimes travel long distances to “winter yards,” Class said. Research in the Superior National Forest has detected seasonal migrations of nearly 25 miles. 
A GPS-collared whitetail deer in Missouri was also once documented making a nearly 200-mile journey that crossed major rivers and interstate highways.
Mong has plenty of curiosity to learn more about what’s going on with whitetails that migrate into the Absarokas: “As a biologist,” he said, “it makes my head spin and want to try to figure it out.”
But the task of learning more would be “difficult,” Mong added.  
There are just a few migratory animals they’re aware of, and the known points they pass by are well into the wilderness.

Instead of fixing Wyoming’s real maternity problems, the far right maintains its anti-abortion campaign, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Freedom Caucus concocts phony pregnancy center crisis appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is facing a maternal care crisis. But instead of figuring out how to support women who actually want to have babies by increasing their access to OB-GYN care, the supposedly pro-family Freedom Caucus is more worried about protecting anti-abortion pregnancy centers. 

Opinion

The Freedom Caucus-backed Wyoming pregnancy center autonomy and rights of expression bill is a textbook case of “a solution seeking a problem.” 
Why does this bill stand out in comparison to the countless others that never should have seen the light of day? Because there isn’t a single instance of harm to these unregulated pregnancy centers committed by a person or entity in Wyoming that any of the bill’s backers can cite as a reason why they need special protection.
On the flip side, Wellspring Health Access in Casper, the state’s only abortion clinic, was set on fire in May 2022, delaying its opening by nearly a year and causing nearly $300,000 in damages. I don’t recall any state lawmakers rushing to provide more protections for pro-choice clinics.
But supporters of this bill, who want you to call it the CARE Act, also want you to believe that the state and its political subdivisions, including cities and counties, pose a real threat to pregnancy centers. The bill would prohibit governmental entities from enacting laws, ordinances or policies that would interfere with a pregnancy center’s mission.
The current bill, which was approved 12-2 by the Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee, was resurrected by Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, co-chair of that panel and chair of the far-right Freedom Caucus. The version she sponsored earlier this year was passed by the House 46-14, but died when the Senate didn’t consider it.
Wyoming has 11 pregnancy centers. The bill says the nonprofit organizations “encourage women to make positive life choices by equipping them with complete and accurate information regarding their pregnancy options and the development of their unborn children.”
Several people challenged those false claims, including Emma Laurent of Sheridan, who dismissed the centers as “fake clinics.”
“Because the ideology of these centers is allowed to take priority over evidence-based medicine, women are not guaranteed accurate information about all of their options, which they deserve,” Laurent said. “Instead, they’re met with misinformation, shame, and pressure to continue pregnancies, even in cases where that may endanger their health, safety and dignity. 


“That’s not free speech, it’s medical deception,” she added. “And this Legislature should in no way be in the business of protecting it.”
The bill contains a ludicrous laundry list of things state and local governments cannot require pregnancy centers to do, like offer or perform abortions; provide or distribute abortion-inducing drugs or contraception; or “interview, hire or continue to employ any person who does not affirm the center’s mission statement or agree to comply with the center’s pro-life ethic and operating procedure.”
In another shocking provision, authorities cannot keep a pregnancy center from providing diapers, baby clothes, baby furniture, formula or similar items because it doesn’t perform, refer or counsel in favor of contraception. 
Does the Freedom Caucus really believe we have to worry about living in an Orwellian nightmare where police use battering rams on a pregnancy center’s front door and tell startled workers, “Start giving out these condoms, I’m confiscating those diapers!”
Here’s my favorite exchange from the meeting:
“It’s always interesting to me how worried we are about the next generation, and yet we’re killing the next generation,” Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, said to Laurent. “So what do you have to say about that?”
Laurent explained that she’s Jewish, and in her religion, it’s considered a fetus, and not a baby, until birth.
“There’s no such thing as an unborn child, and certainly not in science. And so that isn’t the next generation,” Laurent said. “I’m the next generation; I’m sitting here in front of you. And what I’m asking you guys to do is protect us while we’re here.”
Linda Burt, a Cheyenne attorney and former head of the Wyoming ACLU, said a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling protecting nonprofits’ free speech rights against being forced to provide abortion information makes the bill unnecessary.
“Exempting any kind of nonprofit corporation — which is what this is — is providing special legislation for one kind of nonprofit corporation,” Burt said. “It opens the door for everybody to ask for special protections.”
You know who could use some more protection from actual acts of violence? Abortion clinics.
In January, President Donald Trump limited enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a federal law created to safeguard abortion clinics, patients and providers. He dismissed a handful of current ongoing FACE Act investigations and instructed prosecutors to apply the law only in “extraordinary circumstances” such as death, extreme bodily harm or significant property damage.
Incredibly, Trump pardoned 23 people for FACE convictions ranging from harassing pregnant patients to breaking into clinics and stealing fetal tissue. Several have said they plan to return to targeting and invading abortion clinics.
Joan Brust of Casper testified that for over a year she was a patient escort for the Wellspring abortion clinic, which is located near a pregnancy center. 
“What I saw coming from the pregnancy centers was not all ‘Kumbayah,’’’ she related. “They had volunteers and employees harassing the patients who were trying to go to the abortion clinic. They would offer them flowers and prayers and sweet and kind words, but they would also block their cars and try to get them to come down to their clinic.”
The Freedom Caucus steamrolled two more anti-abortion bills through the Legislature during the most recent session, one designed to regulate abortion clinics out of business by requiring them to operate as surgical centers, and another to require ultrasounds.
The two new laws were blocked by a state judge. A near-total ban and one targeting medications, meanwhile, were both ruled unconstitutional by a state district court judge in Teton County, which the state of Wyoming appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Its final decision hasn’t been rendered. 
But lawmakers like Rodriguez-Williams are using the time her committee has been tasked to find solutions to Wyoming’s “maternity deserts” — areas without a hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and without any obstetric physicians — to keep beating the anti-abortion drum.
It’s typical of the Freedom Caucus’ preferred method of lawmaking: Manufacture a crisis where none exists to gain an ideological edge that can be used during political campaigns to motivate their base and get elected.

(Angela Major / WPR)This article originally appeared in Wisconsin Watch.
A new Republican bill that would exempt certain life-saving medical procedures from falling under the definition of “abortion” is drawing criticism from medical professionals despite being described by its authors as an attempt to protect reproductive health care.
Under the bill, introduced on Friday, medical procedures “designed or intended to prevent the death of a pregnant woman and not designed or intended to kill the unborn child” would not fall under Wisconsin’s abortion definition. They would also not be subject to state laws prohibiting funding for “abortion-related activities” and Wisconsin’s ban on abortion past 20 weeks.
The bill, authored by Rep. Joy Goeben, R-Hobart, and Sen. Romaine Quinn, R-Birchwood, specifically exempts early inductions or cesarean sections performed in cases of ectopic, anembryonic or molar pregnancies from being considered abortion so long as the physician conducting them makes “reasonable medical efforts” to save both parent and unborn child from harm.
Moreover, the bill would change the definition of “unborn child” in Wisconsin statute from “a human being from the time of conception until it is born alive” to “a human being from the time of fertilization until birth.”
OBGYN Carley Zeal, a representative for the Wisconsin Medical Society and fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, said “unborn child” is not a medically recognized term because doctors don’t confer personhood to a fertilized egg or fetus. Legal expert Howard Schweber told Wisconsin Watch he doesn’t expect changing the definition of “unborn child” to begin at fertilization will have a meaningful impact.
Abortion as a political issue hits deep in the heart of Wisconsin, where Marquette Law School polls since 2020 show 64% of all voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Democrats have campaigned in support of eliminating restrictions on abortion, while Republicans, who in 2015 passed the state’s current ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, have sought to increase restrictions on, penalize or ban abortion completely.
The bill follows multiple successive changes to Wisconsin’s abortion law since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and returned the issue of abortion to individual states — leaving Wisconsin scrambling to put together a consistent abortion policy.
The new GOP bill also seems to nod toward several high-profile national incidents of patients dying from being denied reproductive care in states with restrictive abortion bans, even when the bans include exceptions for abortion care if a patient’s life is in danger.
One  National Institutes of Health study found that after Texas’s abortion ban was passed, maternal morbidity during the gestational period doubled from the time before the law despite it having a medical emergency clause.
Goeben and Quinn stated in a memorandum that their bill seeks to “counter misinformation spread by bad actors” about doctors not performing needed medical care for fear of being criminalized under abortion statutes. Goeben told Wisconsin Watch she consulted with physicians about the bill and believes it will reassure them of their ability to provide this care.
“A doctor may at all times, no matter where the state is at on the abortion issue, feel very confident in providing the health care that women need in these very challenging situations that women face,” Goeben said.
 Medical and legal experts weigh in

Both Zeal and Sheboygan OBGYN Leslie Abitz, a member of both the state medical society, the Committee to Protect Healthcare and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said they oppose the bill.
They argue it is an attempt by the Wisconsin Legislature to use “emotionally charged, ideologically driven, non-medical terms” to “interfere with the patient-physician relationship” in medical care.
“The stated goal of the bill — to distinguish between medical procedures from abortion — is misleading because it suggests that abortion care is not an essential part of comprehensive health care,” Abitz said.
“A woman is putting her health and her life at risk every time she chooses to carry a pregnancy, and so she shouldn’t be mandated to put her life at risk.”
Schweber views the bill differently. While a clause in Wisconsin’s 20-week abortion ban statutes already exempts abortions performed for the “life or health of the mother,” he believes Goeben and Quinn’s bill could make hospitals and insurance companies more comfortable with authorizing lifesaving reproductive health care procedures.
“Insurance companies and hospitals or doctors, in order to err on the side of safety, will tell the doctors not to perform a procedure that is medically needed and, in fact, properly legal,” Schweber said. “(This) law is trying to prevent a chilling effect on legal medical procedures.”
Though the bill is not yet formally introduced, the Society of Family Planning, an international nonprofit composed of physicians, nurses and public health practitioners specializing in abortion and contraception science, opposes it.
“The narrative that exceptions to an abortion ban — or redefining what abortion care is — can mitigate the harm of restrictive policies is based in ideology, not evidence,” Executive Director Amanda Dennis said in a statement.
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has not yet taken a position on the bill, but told Wisconsin Watch that state medical emergency clauses “do not offer adequate protection for the myriad (of) pregnancy complications people experience, resulting in substantial harm to patients” in the case of an abortion ban.
 Political reaction to the bill

Prominent Democratic lawmakers, such as gubernatorial candidate Sen. Kelda Roys, D-Madison, have criticized the proposed bill as part of a series of moves by anti-abortion politicians to distance themselves from the “deadly” consequences of abortion bans.
“The way that you protect people from legal jeopardy is by not criminalizing health care,” Roys said. “Goeben’s bill just shows how deadly and dangerous criminalizing abortion bans are. It’s an acknowledgement of the truth, which is that abortion bans kill women.”
Goeben said she is surprised by the opposition because her bill on its own does not introduce any additional penalties to abortion.
“These are the issues that the other side of the aisle has talked about, saying, ‘oh, the poor women that can’t get health care!’” Goeben said. “So I thought honestly that this would be supported by everybody, if we are really concerned about the health care of women.”
She said she would also be open to discussing amendments to the bill, which would include exemptions for abortions performed because of other medical complications such as preeclampsia or maternal sepsis.
Anti-abortion organizations Wisconsin Right to Life, Pro-Life Wisconsin, Wisconsin Catholic Conference and Wisconsin Family Action have endorsed the proposal.
A similar bill by Quinn prior to the Wisconsin Supreme Court invalidating Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban in July died in the Senate last year. Even if the new bill is to pass through the Legislature, Gov. Tony Evers plans to veto it, spokesperson Britt Cudaback told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Looming gubernatorial, attorney general and legislative races in 2026 could decide the future of abortion laws and enforcement in the state. New legislative maps and a national midterm environment that historically has favored the party out of power in the White House gives Democrats their best chance to win control of the Legislature since 2010.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the GOP frontrunner for governor, previously supported a bill planning to ban abortion after six weeks, though he has rolled back that position in recent media appearances and deleted all mention of abortion from his website.
Schweber said Wisconsin’s newly liberal majority Supreme Court will decide the future of abortion in the state. The justices must answer the cases being brought to them on whether the  state constitution guarantees a right to an abortion.
“Just because the U.S. Constitution does not secure a right to abortion does not mean that Wisconsin or Ohio or Texas constitutionally doesn’t have that right,” he said. “Each state supreme court now has to decide this profound question.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Memphis Safe Task Force won’t release the names of more than 1,000 individuals it has arrested or provide details about the charges they face.
Arrest details and charges are routinely made available to the media and public to provide information about crimes taking place in communities and ensure transparency in the work of taxpayer-funded law enforcement.
But multiple law enforcement agencies that comprise the task force have either declined to release detailed arrest information or ignored requests seeking it. 
A Department of Justice spokesperson last week provided a count of task force arrests by categories that include homicides, sex offenses, narcotics, firearms, probation/parole violations, ICE administrative warrants, “other,” and “warrants.” Arrests for outstanding warrants can range from misdemeanors to felony charges. ICE administrative warrants are not criminal warrants, and indicate only that an ICE official determined a person is “removable from the United States.”
But the DOJ spokesperson cited “operational security” in declining to release the names and specific charges for each individual arrested.
Asked to clarify what operational security meant in the context of releasing arrestee information, the spokesperson declined to provide an on-the-record explanation.
Gov. Lee says task force arrest are of violent criminals, gang members; data show that’s not true

The Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to multiple requests for information about arrestee names and charges.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service, the task force’s lead agency, likewise declined to provide the names of those arrested, instead providing arrest numbers under broad categories of crime.  
As of Friday, task force members had made 1,044 arrests, spokesperson Brady McCarron said. But the numbers the Marshals Service listed, broken down into five categories –  “homicides,” “narcotics,” “firearm,” “warrants,” and “sex offenses” – did not add up to 1,044. 
“They do not add up as we are not releasing all numbers,” McCarron said Friday in response to a request to clarify arrest numbers.
McCarron subsequently provided numbers of additional arrests: 187 “administrative” and 155 “others.” He said the task force had also made an unspecified number of arrests on probation or parole offenses, noting that the agency has focused on releasing only the “numbers that are the most in demand – serious crimes.”
“I am not at liberty to answer the questions that were not answered above,” he said in closing his emailed response to questions from the Lookout.
The Memphis Police Department, which has access to booking information, referred questions about task force arrests back to the Department of Justice. 
The Lookout last week also sought this information via public records requests from the mayors of Shelby County and Memphis, and through a Freedom of Information Act request to the U.S. Marshals Service but has not yet heard back.
Yet, one or more members of the task force appear to be compiling and sharing the names of those who have been arrested internally.  
MLK 50: Justice Through Journalism obtained a task force document that lists the names, dates of birth and charges for each individual placed under arrest on a single day in Memphis.
On Oct. 13, the task force arrested 51 people, including seven for immigration-related offenses, MLK50 reported. 
Thirty of the 44 were arrested on warrants for misdemeanors such as failure to appear in court, trespassing and misdemeanor theft of property. Seven individuals were charged with the civil crime of being “unlawfully present in the United States,” not on criminal charges, the news organization, which did not publish individual names, reported.
‘No dependable mechanism to flag task force cases’
State Rep. John Gillespie, a Memphis Republican supportive of the task force’s presence to quell crime in the city, noted all arrest records continue to be public information and said journalists and others have “just got to dig them up.”
Court records in Shelby County are accessible online and in person listing the names of arrestees and crimes for which they have been charged. 
But when asked how one would differentiate the task force arrests, Gillespie said, “I don’t think it matters. I think an arrest is an arrest. I don’t care who’s getting the credit, who’s doing what. 
“I’m grateful … my family’s grateful, my neighbors are grateful,” he said. “The peace of mind and my stress level while driving has gone down astronomically. I don’t know why it matters if the FBI is arresting someone versus the state troopers.”
Traffic citations outnumber federal task force’s arrests in Memphis; sparse data leaves impact murky

Just City, a criminal justice reform advocacy group in Memphis, has been manually combing through court and jail records and observing criminal court proceedings to try to determine the names of individuals detained as part of task force activities, with little success.
“There’s no dependable mechanism to flag task force cases,” Josh Spickler, executive director, said. 
Hundreds of cases filed on court dockets sometimes include affidavits mentioning the involvement of Homeland Security or other federal officials in charges, but many contain such sparse detail it’s impossible to know if federal law enforcement was involved in an arrest, he said.
“It’s being either intentionally, or incompetently, vague and difficult to parse and understand,” he said. 
“We need help, according to President Trump, according to Gov. Lee, so 1,500 law enforcement agents have been sent to a community that has less than 300 police officers and to measure that impact we need to know what they’re involved in and if it’s having an impact on violent crime,” he said. 
Absent public reporting of those arrested and detained, family members are also having a difficult time finding loved ones, one local advocate said. 
A majority of phone calls coming into a community hotline set up to respond to the federal presence are asking for help finding individuals whom family members suspect have been detained by ICE, said Maria Oceja of Vecindarios 901 and Free the 901, community groups monitoring federal activity in Memphis.

‘Accounting and transparency’
The lack of arrest details follows a pattern in which task force officials have so far refused to answer questions submitted by Lookout reporters. 
Gov. Bill Lee’s office and Tennessee Highway Patrol have not acknowledged questions about the daily costs of the operations or the number of THP officers and Tennessee National Guard members involved. Lookout reporters sent questions to Lee’s office on Oct. 14 and the highway patrol on Oct. 16.
“They need to be very transparent on what that money’s spent on and how it goes out,” said state Rep. Jesse Chism, a Memphis Democrat. “I think there needs to be… accounting and transparency.”
President Donald Trump and Lee launched the task force – made up of hundreds of officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, the ATF, U.S. Marshals Service and Tennessee Highway Patrol – at the end of September to “restore law and order” in Memphis.
The task force is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to move federal and military personnel into U.S. cities. Trump brought National Guard troops into Washington D.C. in August and has recently increased ICE raids in Chicago, drawing pushback from locals. 
The Memphis task force began operations on Sept. 29 and Tennessee National Guard members were spotted in Memphis over a week later. Lee told reporters in a news conference that the operation has no end date and the number of task force members in the city would fluctuate.
Shelby County Mayor declares state of emergency in response to Memphis Safe Task Force arrests

U.S. Marshals Service Director Gadyaces Serralta commands the operation. The task force holds “regular meetings throughout the day, and week, that plans, organizes and executes the given operations of the day,” an agency spokesperson said. “These are joint meetings with all partners and participants.”
Last week, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris declared a state of emergency due to the strain of arrests on the county’s detention centers by the task force. Memphis is the largest city in Shelby County. On Friday, Harris and other state and local elected officials filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the National Guard deployment in Memphis. The lawsuit alleges the deployment violates the Tennessee constitution and state law.  
How much is this costing taxpayers?
Shortly before forming the task force, Lee said he was designating $100 million in Violent Crime Intervention and Downtown Public Safety Grants for it. The legislature approved these two programs as part of its budget earlier this year, before the task force was created.
State Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Memphis Democrat, said at an initial meeting before the task force launched that Lee told him it would cost $1 million a day. But it was unclear whether this referred to costs to the state, federal or a combination of both. Parkinson said he had no idea how much the state is spending.
Lee’s office has not answered any questions submitted by the Lookout related to the budget of the task force operation.
The governor has some latitude to move Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers around the state at his discretion.
The Tennessee Highway Patrol has a budget of around $300 million, and roughly $72 million covers operations expenses, such as paying for troopers’ hotel lodging and other non-salary expenses incurred as part of the task force.

Steve Cohen, a Democrat of Tennessee's Memphis-based 9th Congressional District supports the deployment of agents from several federal agencies to Memphis. (Photo by Patrick Semansky-Pool/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said Monday he backs the buildup of some federal law enforcement agencies in a Memphis crime-fighting effort but opposes deployment of the National Guard and stepped-up immigration enforcement.
Cohen, who has represented Memphis in Congress since 2007, said the surge’s purpose should be “law enforcement” for criminal violations such as murder, rape and assault, not mobilization of the military and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for immigration violations, which are civil cases.
“My concern is the National Guard gives the impression that the city may not be hospitable to visitors and may make people feel uncomfortable,” Cohen said. “I’m afraid it may be the National Guard usually comes with ICE, and the rest of this may be somewhat of a red herring, really here to deport people.”
President Donald Trump launched the Memphis crime task force with Gov. Bill Lee’s cooperation more than two weeks ago.
The U.S. Marshals Service, which is coordinating the operation, reported last week that 187 people were arrested on administrative ICE warrants, meaning they could be deported, while more than 400 people were arrested on “warrants,” with no explanation given, and 155 for “other” reasons. The biggest numbers were for traffic citations, 4,600, outpacing 1,044 total arrests, including eight for homicide, 48 for sex offenses, 100 for firearms violations and 116 for drug violations.










My concern is the National Guard gives the impression that the city may not be hospitable to visitors and may make people feel uncomfortable.


– U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen


Cohen could not speak to the wide gap between arrests and the more than 4,000 traffic citations issued to Memphis motorists but said those could be used as a reason to stop people. He pointed out Memphis has had “terrible incidents” on its highways stemming from drag racing and noted that two police officers were charged with drag racing recently. 
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said last week his office had heard reports of “racial profiling” by the task force as the county filed suit against the state to halt deployment of the National Guard.
State Rep. Justin Pearson, who recently announced he is challenging Cohen in the 2026 Democratic primary for Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District, opposes the buildup, calling the National Guard mobilization a “military occupation” designed to control Black communities rather than reduce crime.
Pearson said Monday the governor’s deployment of Guard troops in Memphis violates the Tennessee Constitution.
Rep. Justin J. Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, said deployment of National Guard troops violates the Tennessee Constitution: “No one is above the law,” he said. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“No one is above the law, nor should anyone be allowed to abuse our state Constitution to advance the policies of the Trump administration,” Pearson said in a text message.
While Cohen did not address Harris’s comments about profiling, Pearson said he is “deeply concerned” about ICE and immigration detentions as well as the targeting of Black and brown motorists instead of violent criminals.
Rather than an “illegally” mobilized military sent to “criminalize” groups of residents, Pearson said his Memphis district needs federal investment to eradicate poverty and curb gun violence. Firearms are the leading cause of death for children in Tennessee, said Pearson, who blamed the Republican-controlled legislature, governor and gun lobby for the escalation.
Cohen said the FBI has been in Memphis for years, with either a headquarters or branch, and worked on an operation earlier this summer with local and state law enforcement agencies to cut crime. Memphis Mayor Paul Young and Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis both said they received support from the federal agency, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
“I have no problem with that if they’re helping our crime situation,” Cohen said. “And our crime situation is hurtful to the victims of the crime, but it’s certainly hurtful to Memphis in addition because it makes people question whether they want to visit and whether they want to have a convention here.”

When the Republican megabill is fully in […]","Gov. Patrick Morrisey announces on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025, that he is asking for West Virginians’ input on the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)West Virginia may receive at least $100 million a year from a five-year federal program aimed at “transforming the health care delivery ecosystem,” but that money won’t make up for the Medicaid funding state hospitals stand to lose when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is fully implemented.
When the Republican megabill is fully in effect, West Virginia hospitals will lose more than $1 billion per year, Jim Kaufman, president and CEO of the West Virginia Hospital Association, told West Virginia Watch. 
“That will have an impact, and hospitals will have to figure out what they do to ensure access with fewer resources,” Kaufman said. “And that may radically change what they can offer in certain communities.”
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or HR 1. Congress included the $50 billion rural health fund in the bill in response to the threat of rural hospitals closing because of historic Medicaid cuts in the bill. 
The legislation cuts states’ directed payment programs for Medicaid. West Virginia currently levies a 6% provider tax — the maximum allowable — on hospitals that care for Medicaid recipients. The money collected goes toward Medicaid and the state draws a 3-to-1 federal match for that money. The money is distributed to state hospitals based on the number of Medicaid beneficiaries it serves, Kaufman said. 
Beginning in 2028, the law requires states to lower their provider taxes to a maximum of 3.5%. The legislation also lowers the Medicaid payment rates to those of Medicare, which don’t cover the full costs of services, he said.
The bill also includes work requirements and more frequent redeterminations for Medicaid, which are also expected to decrease the number of recipients. 
And while hospitals will feel the brunt of the Medicaid cuts, Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Association, said that very little of the Rural Health Transformation Program money is slated to go directly to hospitals.
“You can’t do capital expenditures beyond minor alterations to a facility,” Sutphin said. “You can’t use it to replace any provider revenue that is already being paid for. So you can’t add enhanced reimbursement for certain services.”
The money also can’t be used to replace Medicaid funding, Sutphin said. 
“[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’] guidance has made clear that the Rural Health Transformation Program is not meant to backfill deep Medicaid cuts or otherwise shore up the rural health hospitals and providers that will be most impacted by them,” said Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. “In their notice of funding, they specify that no more than 15% of the funding can go to provider payments that would help fill in the gaps of the deepest cuts to Medicaid in our nation’s history.”
If hospitals have to cut services, that will affect entire communities, not just Medicaid recipients, Kaufman said. 
“I’ve actually had somebody say to me, ‘Well, I’m not on Medicaid, I don’t care about those cuts,’” Kaufman said. “Hospitals do not recruit a provider or run a service only for Medicaid. They provide that service for a community. So when you talk about those cuts, that is resources going out of a community.”
Program aims to ‘transform’ health care delivery
According to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Rural Health Transformation Program aims to “strengthen rural communities across America by improving health care access, quality and outcomes by transforming the health care delivery ecosystem.” 
The $50 billion fund will be distributed to approved states over the next five years, with $10 billion will be distributed each year starting in fiscal year 2026. 
Half of the money will be distributed evenly to states with approved applications. The other half will be distributed based on states’ individual metrics and applications that “reflect the greatest potential for and scale of impact on the health of rural communities.
The program has five strategic goals: Make rural America healthy again, sustainable access, workforce development, innovative care and tech innovation, according to CMS. 
Sutphin and Kaufman said the program poses opportunities for the state. 
“This is really, how do we start to transform and modify rural health care delivery,” Kaufman said. 
“We are confident that Gov. Morrisey’s team is going to put forth an application that will benefit West Virginians and will be eligible for funding through CMS,” Sutphin said.
Public submits ideas for money
The federal government opened the application period for the funding Sept. 15, giving states a deadline of Nov. 5 to submit their applications. 
During a new conference Sept. 18, Gov. Patrick Morrisey asked for public input about what the state should include in its application. The governor asked that ideas be submitted by Sept. 29 in order for his administration to meet the tight deadline. 
“We have a chance to help our citizens live longer, healthier lives… We have an opportunity to reverse some of the terrible health trends that we’ve seen that have plagued our state for a long time,” Morrisey said at the time. “I think the key to our application is to really go in and focus on things that we can meaningfully improve.”
Speaking to state lawmakers earlier this month, Curtis Capehart, Morrisey’s director of policy, said the office had received approximately 2,000 pages of responses from more than 221 citizens and organizations. The state hired McKinsey and Company to help with the application process, he said. 
The Rural Health Association submitted ideas focusing on three areas: a rural health pipeline to give health profession students opportunities to have rotations in rural communities, a mechanism to train and recruit health care providers by offering enhanced benefits, and encouraging automation of certain parts of the health care system.
The Hospital Association submitted the ideas of a wellness initiative, expanding access to technology including telemedicine and expanding residency programs to attract and keep physicians in rural areas and another to use artificial intelligenceIto support clinicians, Kaufman said. 
Capehart said the governor’s office had been meeting with large health care networks, academic institutions, associations and researchers on the application. 
He said the administration’s three strategic priorities for the program application include identifying health care barriers to workforce participation, establishing the state as a center for rural health innovation and partnership, and improving access to care and sustainability of the healthcare system.
Kaufman said the program can improve health outcomes and access if the money is used correctly. The state also has to understand that it’s one-time money, he said. 
“The biggest thing is, how do you support the sustainability in year six, when the dollars dry up?” Kaufman said.

In 2016, former state Rep. David Lewis (a man later convicted of multiple felonies) proclaimed on the House floor during a redistricting debate that he and his colleagues had intentionally rigged a new U.S. House map to guarantee a 10-3 Republican majority in a deeply purple state in which Democratic candidates frequently win the most votes – only because, Lewis said, he couldn’t figure out a way to make the map 11-2.
Ever since then, GOP leaders have made it plain that winning and accumulating power are all that matters. Any subsequent statements about fair and honest elections were merely a smokescreen designed to provide a crutch for friendly judges overseeing inevitable post-election court cases and/or to con a distracted public.
That said, professions of pure motives have remained a regular feature of the Republicans’ public approach to election law. Common sense – and ultimately, a Trump-appointed federal judge – confirmed that it was baloney, but even GOP state Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin went to extreme lengths earlier this year to at least pay lip service to the notion that his effort to overturn Justice Allison Riggs’ narrow victory in the November election by tossing thousands of legally cast votes was somehow motivated by a commitment to justice.
As has been made clear in recent days, however, this disingenuous game-playing has finally been officially abandoned. As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported, both state Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) made this remarkable fact crystal clear last week when they took to social media to admit that the new U.S. House map GOP legislators intend to pass into law this week is motivated by but one factor: doing the bidding of President Trump.
This is from Hall:
“President Trump earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,”
And this was from Berger (a man who, two decades ago, sponsored bipartisan legislation to turn the state’s redistricting process over to an independent commission):
“The #NCGA is ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump’s agenda forward!” Berger wrote in a statement on social media after the map’s release Thursday.
It’s important that North Carolinians grasp the substance and significance of these statements and the dramatic and deeply troubling sea change they represent in how laws are being made in our state.
Two of the most important elected leaders in North Carolina have now publicly admitted that they are willfully and quite cheerfully trashing one of the most fundamental premises of representative government – the idea that the composition of a legislative body should at least do a reasonable job of representing the voters who elected it – in favor of a crude and blatant power grab.
This represents a stunning new low in the Republican-led march toward autocracy.
Sure, there’s nothing new about gerrymandering. Both parties have engaged in it regularly down through the years – often disguised in hypocritical pretenses — but never in such a blatant, crude and overtly anti-democratic way.
GOP defenders may try to claim that Berger and Hall’s overt bragging about their actions and motives is somehow refreshingly honest, but that ignores the way it degrades our democracy. When our leaders stop even pretending that they are motivated by anything other than raw power, longstanding fundamental premises of democratic government and fair play are relegated to very thin ice indeed.
And of course, the statements themselves represent an outrageous perversion of how representative government is supposed to work.
Earth to Sen. Berger and Rep. Hall: the composition of Congress has nothing at all to do with who happens to sit in the White House. And even if it somehow did, the fact that Donald Trump eked out 50.8% of the vote in last year’s North Carolina presidential contest hardly represents a “clear mandate.”
To the contrary, last year’s election represents but the latest in a long line of races in which North Carolinians have repeatedly shown themselves to be a closely divided lot that leans toward a desire for political dialogue and compromise, not Trump’s ongoing radical assault on the national social contract.
Tragically, at this point, there’s little if anything North Carolinians can do to resist this latest assault on their democracy. State law gives the General Assembly virtual carte blanche to rig electoral maps without the Governor’s approval, and Republican judges have repeatedly rubberstamped such schemes.
As noted in this space a couple months’ back, the best hope for both our state and nation is that those who reject this latest perversion will eventually win enough elections so that they’re able to overturn it and, at last, usher in a system of independent and lawful redistricting. One prays that the decision of Republicans to stop pretending about who they are and what they’re up to will ultimately help abet the process.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/redistricting-cartoon430.jpg,,,2025-10-21 06:17:19.073952

Last week U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson dubbed “No Kings” a “Hate America” event. He was wrong. The protest was more of a love fest for America and for American democracy. The protesters were angry about President Donald Trump’s anti-democratic power grab, but they were joyously celebrating America and its Constitution. 
When the crowd sang the national anthem, it was a reverent homage to our great country, sang in a heartful way. When the anthem reached the inspiring “land of the free,” the crowd erupted in celebration, with American flags waving against the blue autumn sky. 
Conservative columnist David Brooks lamented in a recent article in The Atlantic magazine that Americans seem apathetic about Trump’s authoritarian tendencies and the cowardice of his acolytes in Congress. “Why hasn’t a resistance movement materialized here?” Brooks asked. He wrote that the Trump administration operates “as a national extortion racket, using federal power to control the inner workings of universities, law firms, and corporations. It has thoroughly politicized the Justice Department, launching a series of partisan investigations against political foes. It has turned ICE into a massive paramilitary organization with apparently unconstitutional powers.” 
I wonder what Brooks thinks now that an estimated seven million Americans showed up in large cities and small towns across America to declare that they do not want a king, a dictator, a tyrant. Protesters even showed up in Lexington where American democracy was born with flintlock muskets. This time, democracy is being defended by Americans taking peacefully to the streets, by brave federal judges, and, most importantly, by voters. 
Donald Trump’s reaction to the “No Kings” rallies was predictable: “Who cares?” He should care and so should members of Congress. They disregard the message that Americans sent on Saturday at the risk of their own political careers. 
Speaker Johnson said the No Kings crowd would be filled with “Marxists” and people who are “against capitalism.” Instead, I saw grandfathers and grandmothers. I saw young couples with small children. I saw Republicans, yes Republicans. I saw business leaders. I saw veterans. I saw cowboys. I saw a woman with a box filled with copies of the U.S. Constitution which she bought with her own money and passed out for free. I even saw tall yellow chickens, green frogs, a unicorn, and a dinosaur. And I saw dogs, lots of dogs. I saw elderly people sitting in camp chairs because they were too frail to stand for hours. Still, they wanted to stand up for democracy by sitting down. 
Everyone carried posters that reflected a diversity of messages, but one theme: We do not want a king or a dictator, we want a constitutional democracy. 
Donald Trump might dismiss protesters as “fools” as he did those who died on Normandy beaches in the defense of democracy and against authoritarianism. But the Idahoans I saw on Saturday are not fools, and they aren’t fooling around. They represent the heart and soul of America. 
An Iraq Marine veteran attending the No Kings protest in Washington, D.C., told the Associated Press: “I fought for freedom and against this kind of extremism abroad. And now I see a moment in America where we have extremists everywhere who are, in my opinion, pushing us to some kind of civil conflict.”
Historian David McCullough believed that George Washington was the greatest American who ever lived. Washington was so beloved by the American people he could have become a king. Instead, after two terms as our first president, Washington returned to Mount Vernon because he loved his country and democracy more than he loved power.
McCullough wrote of Washington: “Our gratitude to George Washington should be beyond measure and to have had that particular man with his integrity, his courage, his decency, his stability, his sense of duty to the common good, as our first president is almost miraculous.” 
In contrast to Washington, today we have a president positioning himself to run for an unconstitutional third term in office and we have members of Congress so afraid of losing their power they are remaining silent in the face of tyranny. 
History – if our democracy survives so we have one – will judge Donald Trump, members of Congress, including Idaho’s silent four, and the complicit U.S. Supreme Court very harshly. Compared to Washington and the millions of patriots who took to the streets on Saturday to defend the Constitution, they are very small indeed.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Landowners forced to participate in Summit Carbon Solutions’ planned carbon dioxide storage project in North Dakota are claiming the state received more favorable contract terms than private property owners were offered. 
The state’s contract with Summit grants the company permission to store carbon dioxide under public lands and includes provisions for additional insurance and legal and environmental protections that were not granted to private landowners. 
Some of these protections are similar to what private landowners asked for in a lease, but Summit wouldn’t negotiate their inclusion, attorney Derrick Braaten said. 
“It’s sort of like salt in the wound, because we tried really hard to negotiate with them. They absolutely stonewalled us,” Braaten said. “These are very real and significant protections that were, to some extent, at the crux of what we were trying to negotiate.”
The protections in the state’s agreement but not contained in the lease for private landowners the company submitted to state regulators include: 

Requiring Summit to maintain a $5 million pollution insurance policy. 
A general liability insurance policy of $2 million, twice what private landowners are covered by. 
Guaranteeing Summit will defend the state from any legal action “arising out of or in any way related” to Summit’s activities, called “indemnification.” Private owners received more limited legal protections. 
Summit promises to operate in a way that “avoids the degradation of air, land and water quality and that protects the property’s visual resources” for state lands. 
The company pledges to avoid pollution, nuisances, waste and litter on or from the state property. 

Summit denies these represent significant differences. The state received the same royalty rate as private landowners.

Summit is proposing to inject 18 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, gathered from ethanol plants in five states through a 2,000-mile pipeline, into underground cavities called pore space in central North Dakota. 
The future of the pipeline and storage site was called into doubt earlier this month when Summit requested its pipeline route permit in Iowa be modified to remove North Dakota as the endpoint, allowing the company to consider carbon storage sites in other states. 
The storage project encompasses 90,000 acres in Mercer, Morton and Oliver counties and includes both state-owned and privately-held land. The company has obtained leases for 93% of the property, including the state’s 480 acres.
The other 7% of the pore space, accounting for 6,300 acres, will be included in the project even though its owners have not signed a lease with Summit. Carbon dioxide injected underground will not stop at property lines on the surface and so specific property owners cannot be excluded from the project. 
“Summit took a fair, consistent approach to pore space leases,” said Sabrina Zenor, a Summit spokesperson, in an emailed statement. 
North Dakota approves CO2 storage for Summit pipeline

State law allows the North Dakota Industrial Commission, a three-person regulatory board led by the governor, to force pore space owners to participate in a storage project if a company has obtained permission from the owners of at least 60% of the pore space. The Industrial Commission did so in December 2024. The process, called amalgamation, is being challenged in the courts. 
But the agreement Summit reached with the state contains several small differences from the lease the Industrial Commission has ordered applies to nonconsenting landowners, which Braaten said could potentially have a significant impact.
“They claimed during the hearing, ‘well, we treat everyone equally and that’s why we wouldn’t negotiate,’” Braaten said. “They don’t treat everyone equally. They treat the state with more respect, because they need something from the state.”
Trust lands
The easement Summit negotiated with the state is different, in part, because it was based on a different initial document. 
Land Commissioner Joseph Heringer said his staff used an existing pore space easement as a starting point in the negotiations. The original easement was based on the thousands of similar agreements the department has negotiated for public lands over the years, he said. 
“When we go into these things, we’re trying to do the best we can to protect the lands that we have, the trusts that we have, and the beneficiaries that those lands are supposed to benefit,” Heringer said.
Some of the standard provisions include the requirement for $5 million in pollution insurance coverage, which is required by the Office of Management and Budget for state contracts. 
Private landowner negotiations
While Heringer said he was grateful his staff had the opportunity to engage in a meaningful negotiation with Summit, some private landowners say they did not have that chance. 
“At this point we have not received this opportunity,” said Michael Haupt, a landowner in Mercer County whose pore space is being used by the project against his wishes, in an email. “If it is important for the (Department of Trust Lands) to have this opportunity, hopefully you will understand our request as private landowners for the same opportunity.”
Kurt Swenson, one of the most vocal landowners objecting to the amalgamation of his land in Oliver and Mercer counties and a plaintiff in a lawsuit appealing the Industrial Commission’s decision, said he tried to negotiate language protecting his land from certain levels of noise and light nuisances but Summit declined. 
North Dakota Supreme Court allows landowner challenge to CO2 storage law to proceed

“They refused to put that type of stuff in the contract to us, but they gave it to the state,” Swenson said. 
Swenson and Braaten don’t begrudge the Department of Trust Lands staff’s attempt to negotiate the best deal they could for public lands they’re charged with protecting. Nor do they oppose the principle of the carbon storage project Summit is proposing. But Swenson wants the same opportunity to negotiate.
“The state forcing us to be subject to terms and conditions on an agreement we haven’t signed, and then extending more favorable terms to themselves, is just wrong,” Swenson said. 
Tara Righetti, a University of Wyoming College of Law professor, has spent years researching carbon capture projects. She said it’s not unusual for a company to seek similar agreements with a large group of landowners. 
Reaching a uniform agreement carries several advantages for the company including cutting down on the administrative burden of complying with thousands of leases with different terms and compensation levels, Righetti said.  
Landowners in southeastern Wyoming flipped that approach on its head. Righetti said a large group of landowners representing hundreds of thousands of acres in a proposed carbon storage project formed a coalition and presented the company with its own contract to use as a starting point in a collective negotiation. The company, unlike Summit, agreed. 
“The developer who was developing this project basically said anyone else who wants the same terms negotiated as the landowner group, we’ll give the same terms to anyone else who wants them,” she said. 
Braaten has observed a growing trend of companies seeking to limit landowners to a uniform compensation amount during lease negotiations for big projects. In some industries, certain provisions are off the table for negotiating because they contain language that is well established to have a specific legal definition. But Braaten, who represents a lot of landowners, said he’s never seen a company reject negotiations altogether like his clients experienced with Summit. 
“I’ve been doing this since the oil boom started here,” the attorney said. “I have never seen someone act the way Summit acted here, where they were just literally not willing to negotiate on anything on an individual basis, regardless of circumstances.”
Pollution risks
Carbon dioxide pipelines and underground storage are regulated by federal and, in places like North Dakota, state agencies. But even the best equipment can fail and the best personnel can make mistakes, Braaten said. 
“Stuff goes wrong sometimes and these provisions that the state’s getting are additional protection that the landowners were specifically asking for,” Braaten said.
Accidental releases have occurred from CO2 pipelines 76 times between 2010 and 2024, according to Verite News. A 2020 leak in Mississippi resulted in the hospitalization of 45 people. 
Iowa court to decide if proposed Summit permit change affects pipeline opponents’ lawsuit

Last year, the first carbon sequestration facility in the country, ADM in Illinois, reported CO2 that had been injected underground was leaking from the boundaries of the rock formation serving as a storage facility. The storage facility is near an aquifer used by 800,000 people as drinking water, prompting a state law prohibiting CO2 storage below the aquifer, which was unaffected by this leak.
North Dakota landowners are covered by an insurance policy the Industrial Commission has ordered Summit to secure. The pore space lease, however, does not include a contractual requirement for pollution insurance like the state’s agreement does. 
That difference could have important consequences if carbon dioxide were to leak from Summit’s storage facility in North Dakota. While the state could appeal directly to Summit or take action through the courts if state land is affected by a leak, Braaten worries private landowners, with no signed contract to fall back on, would have to appeal for recourse through the Industrial Commission.
Project status
The future of Summit’s carbon storage project in North Dakota is uncertain. Recent reports suggest the company is exploring the possibility of alternative storage sites outside of North Dakota, such as Wyoming. 
The company has faced legal headwinds in North Dakota and popular opposition to its approach with landowners in South Dakota. Property owners have initiated multiple legal challenges against the project, and the Industrial Commission’s amalgamation powers, in North Dakota. Two remain unresolved. South Dakota earlier this year approved a new law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines and Summit also still needs a permit from South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission for the project to move forward.

The bill, introduced by Sen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne) with a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, cleared the state Senate unanimously shortly after its unopposed approval by the Appropriations committee. Committee chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) noted the proposal wouldn’t have associated costs borne by the commonwealth.
It now goes to the House.
Baker said she developed the measure after an acquaintance won a $100,000 scratch-off jackpot, and was soon targeted by scammers and strangers requesting money. She attributed the problem to technological developments that have made scam calls and outreach easier since the commonwealth’s lottery program started .
“In addition to numerous requests from strangers asking for help with everything from buying a car and paying health care bills, scammers actually called and harassed her grandparents and her mother,” Baker said.  “I believe we owe more protection to certain lottery winners, and Senate Bill 73 works toward fulfilling that goal.”
The identities of large lottery prize winners would not be considered public records under the proposed change to the state lottery laws. However, winners’ towns, boroughs and counties of residence, as well as the amount of the prize, would remain public.
Lottery winners would be allowed to voluntarily waive their confidentiality.
Baker introduced a similar bill in 2023. It passed the Senate, but was never taken up by the House.
The lottery has generated more than $1 billion annually for programs benefitting the state’s senior citizens for the past 13 years, according to Baker.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6495-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-21 05:56:31.505165

His bestselling “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis” was sold as an insider’s confession, but it reads like an obituary written by someone anxious to prove he’d escaped the body. He turned hardship into a brand, pain into a sales pitch, while ignoring the systems that keep both alive. Standing beside Donald Trump, he’s doubled down on the claim that Appalachia’s biggest problem is its own reflection.
But this region isn’t a tragedy. It’s breathing, building, and still creating its own kind of beauty. The people who raised barns, fixed trucks, and now rebuild lives through recovery and community are not elegies; they’re evidence of a revival. 
At Healing Appalachia 2025 in Ashland, more than 25,000 people gathered to celebrate recovery through music and shared effort. No political machine built that stage. It rose from volunteer grit and faith, the kind Vance once claimed to respect, before grievance politics offered him easier applause. Kentuckians Tyler Childers and Chris Stapleton, along with a long list of other musicians, again donated their time and talent to raise money to support recovery organizations.
I wasn’t raised in the deep mountains. I’m from Kirksville, in the foothills in Madison County, where I had more chances than most, a professional father, a mother with a psychology degree, and the means to leave. Yet when my life collapsed from alcoholism, it was Eastern Kentucky that helped me stand again. People written off by the same system that crowned Vance a success story taught me what redemption really looks like: quiet endurance, shared strength, and an open door for anyone willing to walk through it.
That’s the real Appalachia, where recovery meetings feel like family reunions, where small businesses grow out of garages, and where neighbors check on each other even when no one’s watching. It doesn’t need pity; it needs partnership. It doesn’t need elegies; it needs investment, infrastructure and respect.
Vance sold the myth that Appalachia’s wounds are self-inflicted, that culture, not capitalism, is to blame. Those of us who live and work here know better. We see every day how treatment centers, nonprofits and peer-support groups do more for our communities than any press conference in Washington.
The real Appalachia isn’t trapped between the covers of a memoir or the sound bites of a campaign. It lives in every person who chooses hope over humiliation, connection over contempt. From Ashland to Pikeville, from the foothills to the hollers, this region isn’t dying; it’s rebuilding itself, one act of stubborn love at a time.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1969062597-1024x688.jpg,,,2025-10-21 05:56:31.505165

Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace, spent $5.8 million in the 2024 fiscal year on marketing and outreach and to sponsor events and organizations that educate the public about the organization’s services. The audit found Connect for Health did not consistently follow its own process for selecting events or organizations to sponsor, and it did not properly document sponsorship decisions. 
About 30% of the sponsorships Connect for Health undertook between July 2023 and December 2024 did not focus on a Connect for Health target audience. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Without improvements, there’s an ongoing risk that sponsorships may not follow Connect for Health’s processes or align with its mission,” audit manager Kate Shiroff said in a statement. 
Colorado state legislators requested the audit after some expressed concerns about Connect for Health sponsoring a 2023 fundraiser for ProgressNow, a progressive political advocacy organization. The audit’s review of a sample of other sponsorships did not find “any instances in which Connect for Health sponsored an event for or donated money to a political fundraiser or political fundraising organization.”
About 300,000 Coloradans pay for health insurance through the individual market.
Extension of enhanced premium tax credits that support people who purchase health insurance through the state marketplace has been the primary item Democrats in Congress want included in a funding measure that could end the federal government shutdown. Members of Congress failed to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure, and many federal government operations have been shut down since the new fiscal year started Oct. 1.
Republicans in the Senate need some Democratic support to pass a funding measure, but Democrats have refused to support the measure that passed the House without changes to Affordable Care Act tax credits. Insurance premiums are expected to skyrocket with the expiration of the tax credits at the end of this year.  
Corrective measures
Connect for Health should revise and expand its policies around sponsorship vetting procedures to ensure sponsorships align with the organization’s mission, auditors recommended. It also needs to better meet reporting requirements from a 2022 Colorado law related to its spending on its public awareness and outreach campaign. 
Auditors also found that Connect for Health has made some changes to its financial management since the state’s 2017 audit of the organization, but there is still room for improvement, they said. Connect for Health did not consistently document approval and receipts for credit card purchases, and its board has not overseen credit card purchases made by senior managers. 
The organization should clarify its financial management policies with specific guidance around documentation for transaction approvals and business reasons for those transactions. Its policies should also clearly address key activities within the organization and staff should be trained on those policies, auditors recommended. 
Connect for Health agreed to all of the audit recommendations and will implement them over the next year. CEO Kevin Patterson said Connect for Health is committed to transparency and accountability and ensuring the organization’s spending “serves the people of Colorado.” The audit committee also recognized improvements in Connect for Health’s contract management and staff spending oversight following the 2017 audit, Patterson said. 
“The audit found no evidence of politically motivated spending in our sponsorships, a key area of focus. Additionally, the audit confirmed that no funds were misused or used for personal gain,” Patterson said in a statement. “We take its findings seriously and have already begun implementing specific corrective measures to strengthen our fiscal practices.”

Labor shortages, soaring equipment costs and unpredictable weather have also taken their toll.","Mike Reskovac on his soybean farm in Uniontown, PA (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)UNIONTOWN — Mike Reskovac was starting the harvest at his family farm in Uniontown, Fayette County, later than he’d hoped.
Late-season rain meant he had to delay it about a week, since soybeans need to be dry when they’re harvested. Then, Thursday morning, Reskovac discovered two bearings that needed replacing in his combine. That meant calling dealers and suppliers, driving four hours round-trip to pick them up, shelling out $200 and installing them himself. He’d get to the field in the afternoon, and be at the harvest until after the sun went down.
“They always say farmers wear many hats because we’re an agronomist, a mechanic, a weatherman, an equipment operator or whatever,” Reskovac said.
Despite the headaches, there’s still no job he’d rather do. Reskovac, 45, a first generation farmer, learned the trade working on a neighbor’s dairy farm when he was young. When that owner retired, he took over a chunk of the land, and now runs a family farm business with his wife, Sheilah.
Reskovac, a recently appointed member of Pennsylvania’s Soybean Board, hopes it’s a business — and passion — he can hand down to his two sons. He’s already teaching his oldest, 9, how to operate the combine.
“If it’s what they’re passionate about, I want them to do it no matter how hard it is,” Reskovac said. 
But the future of the industry has grown murky, especially when it comes to soybeans, one of Reskovac’s primary crops.
After President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on China, the country retaliated with a boycott of U.S. soybeans. In 2024, China purchased about half of America’s soybean exports.
The reduction in demand has caused the price of soybeans in the U.S. to drop.
But Reskovac said the boycott is only the latest blow to American soybean farmers. While soybean prices spiked around 2020, reaching a high of more than $17 a bushel, they have since returned to near pre-pandemic levels, around $10.
Meanwhile, the cost of machinery has soared over the last decade, labor has grown more costly and hard to find, and unpredictable weather has begun to affect crop yields more regularly.

Last season, Reskovac said droughts in western Pennsylvania cut his yield by about 40%. And dry spells hit especially hard because, when other foliage stops growing, deer turn to soybean fields for food.
“If they were starting out from scratch it would definitely be hard,” Reskovac said. “I don’t know how I’d start from scratch if I had to do it over again.”
 Trade war pressure points

During the first Trump administration, a similar issue arose when steep tariffs were imposed on China. The libertarian and pro-free market think tank, the CATO institute, said more than $23 billion were spent to bail out affected farmers.
Now, the Trump administration is considering a similar move, reportedly preparing a bailout of at least $10 billion. 
While he’d welcome subsidies to offset the losses, what Reskovac really wants is for the state of the industry to improve so he doesn’t need them.
“There’s a lot of negativity about subsidies, and I’m not a huge fan of them, but I’m gonna take something if I’m eligible for it,” he said. “I don’t think people truly understand what it takes to run a family farm. The amount of hours, the amount of time, the amount of dedication, the amount of capital, the amount of investment. We probably borrow enough money a year that a normal person could buy a very nice house.”
But for Reskovac, it’s hard to know whether the current administration has farmers’ backs.
As the trade war with China heats up, the Trump administration is preparing to send $20 billion bailout to Argentina, a nation run by a Trump-friendly President Javier Milei, which is facing an economic crisis.
The move has particularly rankled soybean farmers, since China has turned to Argentina and other South American countries for exports during the American boycott.
Though, Reskovac hopes there’s an upshot.
“Is that going to be our segue to get some of our soybean market into China, through Argentina?” he said. “I’d like to maybe think that.”
But Reskovac isn’t sure any politicians are looking out for American farmers.
He noted that Gov. Josh Shapiro and Pennsylvania Secretary of Agriculture Russell Redding have both talked a good game when it comes to the state’s agriculture industry, but he’s aware that most direct help for farmers comes through the federal government.
Justin Jones, the chair of the Pennsylvania Soybean Board, said one bright side is that farmers in the commonwealth are less reliant on soybeans than many other states. 
“I don’t think there’s anybody that is strictly a soybean farmer,” Jones said. “They’re gonna have grain. They’re gonna have livestock. Something like that.”
And dairy and cattle markets, at least, are faring much better.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 2024, around 620,000 acres of soybeans were harvested in Pennsylvania. That’s compared to 1.3 million acres of hay and haylage, and just over 1 million acres of corn.
Still, for Reskovac, soybeans are a crop that rotate well with corn, his other major crop. They grow well on his western Pennsylvania farmland, and require less labor than some other crops. Reskovac and his wife run their business almost entirely on their own, with some help from friends and family.

However, Reskovac’s business has diversified over the last few years.
Sheilah, a part-time nurse who helps out with the farm business, is heading a corn maze and sunflower field near their home in Uniontown, where locals and tourists can come to pick the flowers themselves. 
The attractions bring money directly into the business, and have become destinations for school field trips.
 ‘All we want to do is survive on our own’

Even more than the export market, Reskovac worries about how the costs of equipment and operations have soared. While crop prices have largely stagnated, the costs of farm machinery, parts, fertilizer, seed and land have all gone up, Reskovac said.
Reskovac’s other major crop, corn, has seen a similar trend to soybeans. Its cost rose sharply around 2020, but has since returned to near pre-pandemic levels.
Between 2021 and 2023, new agriculture equipment prices went up 20%, according to a report from the University of Illinois. That’s compared to an increase of just 14% over the nine year period from 2011 to 2020.
According to Reskovac, a new tractor that would have cost $89,000 in 2013 runs $189,000 today.
“Equipment costs are just going through the roof,” Jones said. “Labor has doubled for us on a per-person basis. Land prices and rents, those have doubled or tripled in the last five to 10 years … Those prices aren’t coming down.”
Until something changes, there’s not much Reskovac can do but hold on and keep trying to find other sources of income, such as growing pumpkins and raising a handful of cattle.
Reskovac said he’s expecting this year to be his third in the red. Last year, he refinanced some of his debt, but doesn’t want to turn to that option too often.
“How do we make more money to keep going? I don’t have a 100% sure, solid answer for that,” Reskovac said. “Farmers are the most optimistic people in the world, or we would never dump that seed in the planter and put it in the ground.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6315-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-21 05:56:31.505165

House District 21, largely anchored in Prince William County, is currently held by incumbent Democratic Del. Josh Thomas, who faces a challenge from Republican Gregory Lee Gorham. Both candidates have made data center reforms a key campaign issue alongside other local priorities.
The district leans Democratic: most voters backed Kamala Harris in 2024 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin carried the district with 51.4% in 2021, and the Virginia Public Access Project rates it as competitive. Thomas has a commanding fundraising advantage, raising more than $740,000 compared to Gorham’s $20,000.

• In House District 22, candidates tackle data centers, rising costs in race for legislature’s future
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75

• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates

Thomas, a veteran and commercial real estate attorney focused on housing issues, said he first ran for the House of Delegates to make housing more accessible and affordable in his community. He was first elected in 2023 and was drawn to run after seeing friends lose their homes due to economic challenges.
“I thought, well, during the last economic calamity I was in the Marine Corps and couldn’t really do anything about it,” Thomas said. “I’m a commercial real estate attorney in a position to do more, and so I said, ‘Yes, I will rise.’”
Gorham, also a veteran and a retired IT professional, has been an active member of the Prince William County GOP. He’s lived in the area for 25 years and is passionate about the history of the area and representing his community family in the area. He told the Prince William Reporter that he decided to ensure the district’s priorities are better represented in the General Assembly. Gorham did not respond to multiple requests from the Virginia Mercury for a one-on-one interview about his campaign.
“I think my constituents want to see accomplishments, not party-line platitudes,” Gorham said.
 Data Centers

House District 21 is home to dozens of data centers. While the county benefits from the tax revenue the industry brings, residents have raised concerns about water use, high-voltage transmission lines, and facilities being built near homes and businesses.
During the regular 2025 session, Thomas sponsored House Bill 1601, which would have required data center applicants to complete a site assessment detailing expected sound pollution and projected water and energy demands for the high load facilities. Youngkin ultimately vetoed that bill. Thomas said his goal wasn’t to hinder the  industry but to set clearer guardrails for local communities.
“Other bills that I’ve had were trying to be more transparent about whether we’ll have the energy for data centers,” Thomas said. “Clean energy for data centers was not going to kill the industry at all. It was just going to make sure we’re doing something about the energy draw that data centers represent to our energy needs, no matter where you build in the state.”
Gorham said controlling data center sprawl is one of his top priorities. He argued that Thomas’ bill did not go far enough to make a real difference. 
“There are many other ways to force data center developers to make better proposals by making it more expensive not to make smarter proposals,” Gorham told a reporter. “Smarter tax laws, target industry tax overlay districts, choice of residential power suppliers, better environmental ordinance tools for localities to choose from, taking control from Richmond, need to be implemented.”
Thomas said he is in favor of changing the rate payer distribution system for data centers to ensure they are covering some of the infrastructure costs when it comes to transmission lines and the debate over if they should remain above ground or buried, which is a much more expensive option. 
 Virginia Clean Economy Act

How to address Virginia’s energy demands — largely driven by the rapid expansion  of data centers — is expected to be a central topic in the next legislative session. Democratic lawmakers are seeking to strengthen the VCEA with additional support for wind, solar, nuclear, and battery storage. 
Thomas said that instead of changing the VCEA to ease constraints for certain industries, the focus should be on energy consumption to prevent strain on the grid.
“I don’t think the conversation around the VCEA is really that pertinent, because it’s the load that is the problem, and we need to start tackling the load so we can then figure out how we want to structure … constraining the load from the government perspective,” Thomas said.
Like many other states, Virginia faces challenges in accurately projecting energy demand for proposed data centers. Projects often enter the interconnection queue before financing or other requirements are finalized — and some never materialize — making long-term load forecasting more difficult.
 Housing

Thomas said he wants to accelerate housing development across  the commonwealth to help ease Virginia’s housing shortage. He acknowledged that increasing housing density in some areas has raised concerns among some of his legislative colleagues, as has finding reliable funding amid federal cutbacks. 
“Some of these programs do cost state money to fund, whether that’s the housing opportunity tax credit, or whether that’s certain abatement programs that localities and the state could step in and help pay for that for housing construction,” Thomas said. 
“But I think that’s another place where, over time, has maybe contributed to this not being where it could be in the form of public private partnerships to create more houses.”
Election day is Nov. 4.

Lee County Community Hospital, a once-shuttered facility enveloped by mountains on the far western edge of Pennington Gap deep in Southwest Virginia, was resuscitated by Ballad Health in 2021. Now, it is one of six Virginia hospitals considered vulnerable amid big federal changes to Medicaid and hospitals.
In the years since its reopening, it has incrementally added new services, like an MRI machine to bolster cancer screenings, additional hospital beds, and a helicopter pad. Despite not having an obstetrics unit, administrator Cindy Elkins said its emergency room has still delivered 14 babies since it opened.
How the Virginia Department of Health is healing internal issues amid federal funding cuts

“I’ve had a couple of our (emergency department) providers actually tell me that it’s sometimes more challenging to work here than a level one trauma center, because they don’t know what’s coming in the door, and it can be anything,” Elkins said. 
She said “anything” includes women in labor, farm equipment injuries, and impoverished people coming in for help wearing shoes that “were falling apart” and sifting through the hospital’s donation pile for clothing. The area had spent nearly a decade without a local hospital.
Although the shifting federal rules pose a risk to services and funding for the facility, Elkins said  there’s good news. Lee County Community Hospital is designated as a Critical Access Hospital, the type of facility where Medicare reimbursement fares a little better. Still, the reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer could cause thousands of Virginians and millions nationwide to lose health coverage. 
“Obviously it’s a huge concern for us,” Elkins said. 
 What the changes mean for patients, hospitals

Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes changes to provider assessment rates and state-directed payment programs. The two funding mechanisms are critical to hospital operation in Virginia and determine how hospitals chip in to the state’s expanded Medicaid coverage. The state’s hospitals are bracing for a $2 billion hit as the changes are fully implemented.
Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million people on Medicaid, roughly 600,000 who became eligible when the state expanded its program in 2018 would be most affected.That year, Virginia became the 33rd state to expand its program to reach others who may otherwise struggle to access health insurance. 
That population will become subject to work requirements and twice-yearly verification for coverage, once the federal changes take hold. State agencies and local governments are preparing for strains in implementing these requirements and advocates say they will be challenging for enrollees to navigate. 
For Lee County’s hospital, administrator Elkins shared that about 75% of its patients have either Medicaid or Medicare coverage. Meanwhile, 21% percent of patients have private insurance they’ve purchased on their own or that is provided by their employers. 
Ballad Health’s chief operations officer Eric Deaton characterized the forthcoming challenges as “pretty scary.” 
He predicts Ballad could lose around $25 million in the first year the reconciliation bill’s hospital funding changes take effect. Ballad is one of the few hospital chains to have a footprint in rural areas. This can mean less profits and smaller operating margins than more urban, suburban or affluent areas, but Deaton called rural communities “a calling” for some physicians and hospital systems. 
“We’re very concerned and we’re really focused on ‘what can we do to work with our legislators in the future?’” he said. 
With uninsured people less likely to seek preventative care, they are more apt to wait for emergencies to get help. That care becomes costlier; hospitals may absorb it for a time but will likely have to find ways to offset costs. 
The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, which represents Ballad and other chains, has noted the potential for staff or service reductions or facility closures. 
The newly created federal Rural Health Transformation Fund stands to make matters a little better, but Ballad government affairs manager Stacey Ely said it’s inadequate to offset the damage done by Congress’ reconciliation bill. 
With $50 billion earmarked over the next five years, states can apply for a piece of the annual $10 billion-per-year pie. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz emphasized in a recent press call how the awarded funds may go towards workforce investments or information technology upgrades. 
“I think it’s a little bit misleading to say that this is going to save rural hospitals,” Ely said. “It’s a $50 billion plug for a $300 billion hole.”
 Speaking out

Southampton Memorial Hospital in Franklin, a seven-hour drive east of Lee County’s hospital, is another vulnerable health care facility in Virginia. During a roundtable discussion with local community members in Franklin, Virginia’s federal and state lawmakers emphasized how the reconciliation bill’s health care impacts stand to affect more than those who’ve relied on Medicaid, echoing concerns hospitals relayed all summer.
When emergency rooms fill with urgent care needs from uninsured patients, hospitals’ negotiations with private insurers could raise rates to offset those costs, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., warned. 
“They’re going to drive up all of our rates,” Warner said. “This will drive up healthcare costs for all of us — rich, poor, middle class and anywhere in between.”
He also issued a call to action for more hospitals to “be transparent” with the local communities. The roundtable event had been hosted at a nearby community center, though Warner said he’d originally sought to host it at the hospital. 
While Bon Secours, the health system that operates Southampton, has not spoken about imminent changes publicly, it is part of the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association — the entity that sent the group letter to Congress this summer. 
Ballad cranked the transparency up a notch — with CEO Alan Levine frequently commenting on social media and Ballad granting The Mercury multiple interviews along with a Lee County Community Hospital tour. 
The process of passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, led by Republicans, experienced some inter-party disagreements over the health care changes, which factored into the creation of the Rural Health Transformation Fund. Virginia U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virignia Beach, had joined a letter in opposition to versions of the bill before ultimately voting for it. 
The pair framed  the bill as a way to protect the longevity of Medicaid in the long term, with the health care changes not poised to take effect until 2027 and 2028 — after each  incumbent’s 2026 midterm elections. 
 Safety nets feel a growing strain

While hospitals brace for patient strain, free clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers have already been triaging matters. 
Both entities have long considered themselves the “safety net to the safety net” and their struggles pre-date federal funding fallouts of the past year and forthcoming years. 
Virginia’s free clinics, for instance, have asked state lawmakers to give them a funding boost as they’ve experienced surges in patients but stagnant funding from the state. This year, the facilities had collectively hoped for $4 million more than typically budgeted for to keep up with its growing demand pre-OBBBA, but received $500,000 more to be used among the state’s 70 free clinics. 
Meanwhile, federal grants administered through the state health department were stalled this year amid federal funding changes and the department’s own preexisting issues — causing a Richmond clinic to take out a line of credit and hope for the best. 
Health Brigade executive director Karen Legato shared this summer that the Richmond-based clinic has lost $1.8 million in state and federal funding over the past year. To continue as many services as possible, Health Brigade is putting its building up for sale.
Likewise, about three hours west in Roanoke, the Council of Community Services has also experienced real estate downsizing, moving all of its operations into the building that has long served as its drop-in clinic. 
While both the Council and Health Brigade have worked to diversify their funding sources, Legato noted “damaged trust” with state and federal entities. 
Still, the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, which represents the state’s clinics, will continue to advocate for state funding. CEO Rufus Phillips has been in touch with hospitals, federally qualified health centers and VDH throughout the year. 
“We’re all in this together as the safety net,” he said. “Hospitals certainly want to lean on the free clinics to meet people at the primary care level to reduce emergency room care. Our clinics are happy to help where they can but they’re strapped as it is.”
 Lawmakers look ahead

As the U.S. Congress has grappled with a government shutdown this fall and Virginia is about to elect a new House of Delegates, governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, it is the state government that may have to carry health care financial burdens at least in the next year. 
Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, a member of the Senate finance committee who has a background as a volunteer firefighter and EMT, emphasized that both state chambers’ money committees will have a retreat later this year where the emerging health care changes will be on the agenda. 
“That’s going to be a key point to receive the outgoing governor’s budget and start to pick apart what the real revenue predictions are, what kind of resources we will have or not have, and be able to tackle some of the major issues that are coming Virginia’s way,” McPike said. 
While term-limited Gov. Glenn Youngkin can present a draft of a state budget that the next governor can work with, all 140 state lawmakers will have some hand in further crafting it. 
As federal workforce cuts continue — with Virginia, Texas and Maryland having the most federal workers among states — trimming  public health funding and plugging competing federal funding holes stand to dominate portions of next year’s budget negotiations. 
“I think that’s where we are right now,” McPike said. “It’s just the macro until we get into more details here in the coming months.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Kelly Ruh resigned from her position as treasurer of the Republican Party of Wisconsin over the weekend, saying that she can “no longer meaningfully contribute” to the party’s leadership given current circumstances.
Ruh, who worked for the party for about a decade, said there is an “absence of a strategic plan, defined objectives, measurable outcomes” alongside budgetary issues. 
“As the saying goes ‘what gets measured gets done.’ Unfortunately, without metrics or accountability, it is unclear what we are working toward or what our capacity is to achieve our objective,” Ruh wrote. “Moreover, the internal dynamics of RPW, particularly the dysfunctional leadership, have made attempts at collaboration increasingly difficult, unproductive and discouraging. The lack of transparency, direction and respect for differing opinions — or even basic board oversight — has fostered a culture that is not only ineffective but also absurd.”
Ruh’s departure comes in a year when the state party has faced calls for changes after tough statewide losses, including in the race for state superintendent and the spring state Supreme Court race where the party’s endorsed candidate lost by 10 percentage points — a result that locked in a liberal majority at least through 2028.
Following the April losses, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming launched an effort to examine what went wrong led by state Treasurer John Leiber, who is the only Republican to hold a statewide office in Wisconsin. 
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the results of the effort included recommended  goals for the party including expanding the out-of-state donor network, encouraging direct donations to candidates and the party, ensuring that third-party groups reinforce candidate and party messaging, hiring an in-house opposition researcher and supplying county parties with talking points. 
“It pains me that the Republican Party of Wisconsin continues to repeat the same mistakes time and again,” Ruh wrote in her resignation letter dated Oct. 19. “Recent election results in Wisconsin are clear — if RPW does not drastically change its approach to everything (leadership, fundraising, messaging, organizing, addressing issues that Wisconsinites care about) then it will play no role in deciding our future.” 
Wisconsin has another slate of crucial elections on deck for 2026 including an open race for governor and lieutenant governor, another state Supreme Court race and elections for the state Senate and Assembly where control will be up for grabs.  
“My sincere hope is that those who remain in positions of authority will institute the critical changes that must be made to our party,” Ruh said. 
Schimming, who was first elected to serve as the state party’s chair in 2022 and won another term in December, thanked Ruh for her service in a statement to WisPolitics without addressing the charges in her letter. He said the party wishes her “the best of luck in her future endeavors.” 
Ruh’s letter was posted to social media Monday by Brett Galaszewski, who serves as fifth Congressional district vice chairman for the state party as well as the vice chair for the Republican Party of Milwaukee County and the national enterprise director for Turning Point Action. He called for the party to heed Ruh’s warnings. 
“Ideologically, Kelly and I didn’t always align. I’m further to the right and we both knew it. But we had real conversations about reforming the movement,” Galaszewski said. “When even voices from the old guard start saying the quiet part out loud, it should be a wake up call for everyone.”

In a 4-3 vote, the House Finance Division II committee voted last week to recommend an amended version of House Bill 675, moving the bill a step closer to a House vote in January. 
The bill would block school boards from bringing forward a budget that is bigger than the budget passed the year before, except for any increase in inflation. Under the bill, in order to bypass that block, school district voters would need to vote by a two-thirds majority to spend above the cap.
Voters in school districts are currently allowed to adopt budget caps voluntarily, but HB 675 would make them the default across the state. 
The idea comes as New Hampshire public school budgets have increased, straining local taxpayers. But critics have said it would unfairly weaken voters’ input over their district’s spending, hurting local control.
New Hampshire, which provides the lowest proportion of state funding to its public schools in the country, relies on communities to support their own schools through property taxes, which make up about three-quarters of the per pupil expenses. Each year, voters meet to approve that spending.
Introducing the proposal back in March, Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican, said the measure is his attempt to address property taxes, which provide the majority of funding for New Hampshire public schools.
“One of the biggest complaints by my constituents, and I’m assuming yours as well, is the accelerating rate of property taxes, most of which is the result of spending in schools,” McGuire said. McGuire argued that despite some wealthier towns spending nearly twice as much per student as poorer towns, the outcomes are not measurably better.
“There is not necessarily a strong correlation, if any, between spending and performance, but there is between spending and property taxes,” he said.
But Rep. Richard Ames, a Jaffrey Democrat, countered that the property tax caps would only perpetuate the disparities between school districts.
“Essentially, this will not quite freeze in, but just about lock in the inequities we have in this system,” he said.
Other critics argued the default caps would make it hard for districts to adapt to years in which special education costs spiked, or they faced an unexpected shortfall. 
The proposed statewide cap was introduced as an amendment to HB 675 in March, replacing the original bill, which changed the adequacy formula. And the idea passed the full House that month. But the House Finance Committee moved in April to retain the bill over the summer, allowing them to focus on the budget. 
With the bill retained, the Oct. 16 vote is the first indication that Republicans are moving forward with the idea. The bill will next go to the full Finance Committee, which will vote on its recommendation on Oct. 30. The full House will vote whether to pass or kill the bill on Jan. 8. 
An amendment to the bill passed last week would allow the budget cap to fluctuate depending on how many students are in the district — an increase in students would increase the cap but a decrease would shrink it.
The proposed cap comes after lawmakers passed a bill in 2024 that empowered voters for the first time to opt into school district tax caps. During annual meetings this spring, voters in most school districts opposed those caps.  
McGuire and other Republicans say implementing a mandatory cap will force school boards to find savings and reduce administrative bloat. And they say if financial emergencies emerge, school boards should be able to convince two-thirds of voters to approve more spending.
“When there is a clear need … the town has a very straightforward escape valve of 66% that they can trigger,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican, speaking back in March. He noted that in most of the towns that considered voluntary budget caps this year, voters rejected those caps with majorities that exceeded two-thirds. 
At last week’s committee meeting, Republicans declined to reiterate their arguments, allowing the recommendation to pass without discussion. But Democrats made clear they still oppose the intervention.
Rep. Kate Murray, a New Castle Democrat, said the state is “in flux” after the state Supreme Court ruled New Hampshire is not adequately funding its schools and directed the Legislature to reach an appropriate solution. 
“I would feel better about a cap if we were adequately funding education in the first place,” said Murray. “And this seems to be cutting education off at both ends. We’re not adequately funding them, and we’re also telling them that they can’t even raise … the cap in order to provide adequate funding.”
Speaking in March, Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat, took issue with the idea that overriding the cap is easy when it is necessary. She said she had helped campaign to defeat a tax cap in Kearsarge Regional School District in January — and to reverse deep cuts in Croydon in 2022. 
Requiring a two-thirds threshold is unnecessarily difficult, she said. 
“Districts already have the option to vote in a cap,” she said. “A number of districts have voted down caps this year in a resounding way. Why are we talking about taking away their local control that we’re forever emphasizing on other things?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/classroomperpupil-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-21 05:16:41.350019

The proposed ballot measure would require the Legislature to enact laws to “protect wildlife and natural resources from unreasonable misuse,” and allow Arkansans to sue the state for violating the measure. 
Kevin Durden, a UA sophomore and one of the drafters of the measure, said he and UA juniors Wyatt Rice, Sydney Stewart and Muskan Taori, are taking action because time is running out to address the climate crisis.

“One constitutional amendment in Arkansas isn’t going to fix everything, but it’ll fix part of it, and doing something’s better than nothing,” he said.
Durden decided to investigate what protections existed for Arkansas’ environment earlier this year after reading about sixteen Montana youth who filed a lawsuit in 2020 that challenged fossil-fuel based provisions of state laws. The plaintiffs, ages 2 to 18, argued the laws contributed to climate change, which violated their right to a clean and healthy environment guaranteed in the state’s constitution. 
A judge ruled in favor of the young Montanans in 2023, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision in December. Last month, a judge awarded $3 million in attorney’s fees in the case, and the Montana Attorney General’s Office said it would likely appeal, according to the Daily Montanan.  
Several of the Montana plaintiffs joined other young Americans in filing a separate lawsuit in May against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies. 
Though climate discussions can be divisive nationally, Rice said what he appreciates about the text of the amendment, which is inspired by Montana’s constitution, is that it’s not specifically about “climate change.” Arkansans generally interact with their environment through recreation and leisure, important things that aren’t “nearly as controversial as some people like to make climate change out to be,” Rice said. 
“That’s something that really works in our favor,” he said. “I don’t know anybody that doesn’t want their kids and their grandkids to have access to the beautiful environment that we have in Arkansas, and so I think that’s really what we’re trying to protect.”
The students, who drafted most of the proposal on their own, are receiving pro bono services from Jennifer Waymack Standerfer, a Bentonville attorney who’s worked on other Arkansas ballot measures.
“It’s cool language, it’s a cool group of kids who came up with it on their own, and I couldn’t say no to helping them,” Standerfer said. 


Let us know what you think...


 

The students have been revising their proposal after Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected their initial submission on Oct. 3. According to an opinion prepared by Assistant Attorney General William Olson, problems with the proposed amendment’s text prevented the attorney general from ensuring the ballot title was not misleading or substituting a more appropriate ballot title. Cited issues included the lack of definition of “environment,” the inclusion of “partisan coloring” language and grammatical errors.
After submitting their first draft, the students had a meeting with the attorney general’s office to learn more about the ballot initiative process and were surprised when Griffin joined for part of it. 
“It was a pleasure to meet with this group of students and see their interest in learning about the political process,” Griffin said. “Being civically engaged at all stages of life is a wonderful thing and is something we should all encourage.” 
Stewart, who joined the in-person meeting over Zoom, was grateful for the feedback.
“I was just really appreciative that they approached it in a way that we want to see this be as successful as possible,” she said. 
Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives such as the students’ proposed amendment, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose constitutional amendments and state laws and put them to a statewide vote.
The process, particularly the petition-gathering phase, will see several changes during the 2026 election cycle due to laws passed during the legislative session this spring. While supporters say the statutes, a number of which are being challenged in court, will protect the integrity of the direct democracy process, opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for Arkansans to propose their own laws.

Durden paused his work on the amendment this spring after realizing “the rules were changing in real time” during the legislative session. When Durden resumed the project this summer, he felt a sense of urgency because he realized the process could face more restrictions in the future. 
“I think most people like being the Natural State. I don’t think anyone wants to see that go away, and getting to use that power for us to bring initiatives, especially at a time when we see a lot of laws trying to restrict that, I thought was really cool,” he said. 
If the attorney general eventually certifies their proposal’s language, the students must then collect nearly 91,000 signatures from registered voters in at least 50 counties. Durden said he wants to avoid paid canvassers and plans to develop a broad network of volunteers at other colleges and environmentally-related groups to help collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. 
While “there’s a lot of pessimism in politics” and people often see younger generations as “disengaged” and “disaffected,” Rice is hopeful their work will demonstrate that’s not the case. 
“No matter what happens, I think it’s important for people to see that young people do care about what happens in their government and what happens in their future,” he said. “And so I think that’s another reason why we want to build this as a large, broad-based movement of younger people, is to get that out there.”
Stewart said she has “felt very empowered by this process” because it’s something she can do, and she hopes it demonstrates how others can take action too. Durden agreed.
“I have a lot of anxiety about a lot of things, but being able to channel that anxiety into something that is productive and that I care about in this initiative has kind of helped mitigate that,” he said. 
The four students are continuing to work with Standerfer to revise their amendment and plan to submit their proposal as soon as possible.

But the state could be poised to end its participation in the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, ahead of the 2026 election after the once-obscure organization became the target of right-wing groups.
Founded in 2012, ERIC initially included seven member states who agreed to share data to identify voters who have moved, died, or who cast ballots in more than one state.
In the years since its inception, the organization has expanded to include a total of 25 states and the District of Columbia, with Georgia joining in 2019. Georgia Elections Director Blake Evans also served as the center’s chair from 2024 to 2025.
But in recent years, the organization has also faced pushback from right-wing groups, who have accused ERIC of being part of a conspiracy aimed at helping Democrats win elections. Nine Republican-led states withdrew from the organization between 2022 and 2023. 
Election rule changes stalled before Georgia lawmakers adjourned and ensured for 2026 midterms

A bill that would have made Georgia the 10th state to withdraw from the partnership cleared the Senate during the 2025 legislative session, but failed to gain final passage before the Legislature adjourned for the year. If it had passed, Georgia would have been required to withdraw from ERIC within 90 days of the law taking effect. Since Georgia has two-year legislative sessions, the legislation, House Bill 397, could still be enacted when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
State legislators are currently examining ERIC and other aspects of Georgia’s election policies as part of a House “blue-ribbon” committee, which is expected to provide recommendations ahead of Georgia’s 2026 legislative session. 


ERIC explained 
Voter roll maintenance is by no means a new concept. Most states are required to update their voter registration lists under federal policies such as the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.
But before ERIC’s formation more than a decade ago, states sometimes struggled to identify which voters had outdated registrations, or failed to take the necessary steps to maintain voters’ privacy, according to Sean Morales-Doyle, who serves as the director of the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. 
One previous multistate compact, known as Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck, worked by matching a voter’s first name, last name and date of birth against registrations from other member states. However, Morales-Doyle said, Crosscheck and other programs like it often faced accuracy issues that resulted in valid registrations being flagged as potential fraud.
“If you just look at first name, last name, date of birth, you’re actually going to get a lot of false positive matches,” Morales-Doyle said. Crosscheck, which at one point was used by at least 25 states, later became the subject of a class-action lawsuit which alleged that the program produced false positives “more than 99 percent of the time,” and exposed partial Social Security numbers of nearly 1,000 voters in Kansas. It was ultimately suspended until officials could implement new security measures.
ERIC, by contrast, matches information like voters’ Social Security numbers against a broad range of datasets, including those from state motor vehicle departments and the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address program. Crucially, the program also implemented cybersecurity practices to prevent sensitive information from being leaked.
“The big advantage to ERIC is allowing collaboration across states and bringing many of these different sources of information together in one place, but also keeping that information secure,” Morales-Doyle said.
Member states use a process called hashing, which is similar to encryption, to protect voters’ information before it is shared between states, according to ERIC’s executive director, Shane Hamlin. 
“When you encrypt a file, then eventually you’re going to unencrypt it and read it again,” he explained during an October legislative study committee meeting. “Once you hash data, there’s really no going back, and so because we hash it twice in the process we use, it’s really difficult to ever get back to the original value.”
According to Hamlin, the benefits of joining ERIC go beyond data security. Member states have centralized access to a variety of data sources that they might otherwise have to obtain through costly and time-consuming state-to-state partnerships. Georgia’s membership dues were roughly $107,000 in 2025, which Evans, the state’s elections director, said was less than the cost of one data analyst’s salary.
“ERIC is an efficient use of taxpayer dollars,” Hamlin told state legislators. “Being a member has a lower cost than attempting to replicate all that ERIC does in a single system or managing 25 plus state-to-state agreements.”


Right-wing resistance
At its peak, ERIC included more than 30 members, but a wave of GOP-led states began withdrawing from the organization in 2022, after the far-right website The Gateway Pundit began publishing a series of stories that characterized ERIC as a “left wing voter registration drive.” Louisiana soon became the first state to withdraw from the partnership, with the Louisiana secretary of state citing concerns about “potential questionable funding sources” and “partisan actors” gaining access to voter data. Other Southern states soon followed suit, including Florida, Texas and Alabama, which all withdrew in 2023.
For some Republican lawmakers, the departure of other conservative member states — including many of Georgia’s neighbors — poses its own impetus for leaving ERIC.

“I’m starting to wonder how effective it is,” said Rep. Martin Momtahan during an October legislative study committee meeting dedicated to voter roll maintenance. A Dallas Republican, Momtahan sponsored a bill to withdraw Georgia from the partnership during the 2025 legislative session, and his proposal was absorbed into the main election bill left waiting for next year. 
Republicans in states like Missouri and Arizona have also taken issue with the organization’s previous bylaws that required states to reach out to voters who may be eligible to vote and encourage them to register. Last year, Georgia was one of nine states who received an exemption from the voter outreach requirement. In July, ERIC amended its bylaws to make the voter outreach provision optional.
In addition to withdrawing from ERIC, the big pending election bill in Georgia would prevent the state from enrolling in any multistate voter list maintenance compact that “requires or encourages” states to contact unregistered residents and help them to register to vote. 
“We don’t need to mix these subjects,” Momtahan said in an interview. “Ultimately, Georgians should be in control of how we run our elections.”
Momtahan said he hopes there will be an appetite to withdraw Georgia from ERIC next year.

But Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat on the committee, called the conservative exodus from ERIC “a rash reaction to the 2020 election,” and urged her fellow legislators to remain part of the organization. 
“I hope we can see this data for what it is, and look at this evidence for what it is, and understand that this is the most secure system,” Draper said. “If we are serious about election integrity in Georgia, we’re going to help grow this program.”
Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center also expressed skepticism about the efficacy of withdrawing from ERIC.
“Election officials of both parties have long said [ERIC] is their best defense against fraud,” he said. “And now, in the name of stopping fraud, people are advocating for them to pull out of ERIC. It doesn’t make any sense.”
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, for his part, has publicly defended ERIC, calling it the “only group capable of detecting double voting across state lines” in a 2023 post on social media. Raffensperger, who is running governor, again defended the state’s participation in a statement earlier this month. 
“Georgia is the best state in the nation for secure elections, and we use multi-state voter data-sharing partnerships like the Electronic Registration Information Center to ensure that only eligible, qualified Georgians are on our voter rolls,” he said.
How would Georgia be impacted by leaving ERIC?
States that have withdrawn from ERIC have often pledged to create new compacts to ensure that their voter rolls are up to date. But in many cases, that may be easier said than done, and states that have departed have often struggled to form interstate partnerships that are as complete or as secure as the one maintained by ERIC. 
Georgia has developed a few individual compacts with states that are not members of ERIC, such as Alabama, Virginia and Florida. However, those agreements require much more time and personnel to maintain, and are sometimes limited by conflicting laws around voter privacy, Evans with the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office said. With Florida, for instance, Georgia has been unable to share voter data because Florida law does not protect voters’ full dates of birth, while Georgia law requires that the month and day of birth remain confidential. 
“We will not sacrifice security of our voters’ data,” Evans told lawmakers.
Evans, who now serves as ERIC’s immediate past chair, urged the legislature to remain in the partnership, arguing that elections officials need more tools to verify voter accuracy, not fewer.
“If we get out of ERIC, then there will be some data that we lose access to, and there’s not a great way to be able to ensure that we continue to get all of that data,” he said in an interview. “Even though some of our neighbors may have gotten out of ERIC, we’re still getting valuable data because people move from Georgia to all over the country.” 
Groups readying mass voter challenges in Georgia’s 2024 elections. There’s an app for that.

Proponents of software like EagleAI, which uses publicly available data to help private citizens submit mass voter challenges to local elections offices, have billed EagleAI as a potential replacement for ERIC. But Evans disputed claims from conservative activists that programs like EagleAI could be a viable alternative.
“They’re using the things that we already have access to, and that we’re already doing,” Evans said of EagleAI. “There wouldn’t be any kind of value added from going out and using a resource like that.”
The special elections committee’s chair, state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican who has launched a bid for secretary of state, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Recent federal legislation ended exemptions to work requirements for older adults, homeless people, veterans and some rural residents, among others. A rapid timeline to put the changes into effect has sparked chaos in state agencies that must cut off access if residents don’t meet certain work, education or volunteer reporting requirements.
States are implementing these permanent changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — commonly called food stamps — amid the uncertainty of the federal government shutdown. The budget impasse could result in millions of Americans not getting their SNAP benefits next month if money runs out. But even before the shutdown, states were assessing the new work rules for food stamps — the first in a wave of cutbacks to the nation’s largest food assistance program required under President Donald Trump’s major tax and spending law enacted in July.
Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the law mandates cuts to social service programs, including Medicaid and food stamps. In the coming years, the law will require states to pay a greater share of administering SNAP and could cause millions of Americans to lose benefits.
But states are currently confronting the end of exceptions to work requirements for older adults, homeless people, veterans and those recently living in foster care. Those could threaten benefits even for people who are working but who may struggle with the paperwork to prove they’re meeting the requirements, advocates say.
Under the new law, states have also lost funding for nutrition education programs, must end eligibility for noncitizens such as refugees and asylees, and will lose work requirement waivers for those living in areas with limited employment opportunities.











They've given us a virtually nonexistent window … in which to implement the changes.


– Andrea Barton Reeves, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Social Services



And the federal government wants those changes made quickly.
“They’ve given us a virtually nonexistent window — I’ll just describe it that way — in which to implement the changes, so we are working on them very quickly,” Andrea Barton Reeves, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Social Services, told lawmakers last week.
She said changing work requirements could threaten the benefits of tens of thousands of people in Connecticut.
“We do believe that if we cannot in some way either move them into another exemption category or they don’t meet the requirements, we have about 36,000 people in these new categories that are at risk of losing their SNAP benefit,” Barton Reeves told lawmakers.
The federal government issued guidance to states earlier this month saying several key changes to food stamps would need to be implemented by early November.
The Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit working to address poverty-related hunger, characterized that deadline as an “unreasonable” timeline for states.
In California, for example, the state previously had been approved for a waiver to work requirements through January 2026. But this month, USDA told states they had 30 days to terminate waivers issued under the previous guidelines. In California, the end of that waiver could affect benefits for an estimated 359,000 people.
State leaders brace for ‘heavy lift’ from Medicaid, food stamp changes

Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center, said states must quickly train their social services workers on eligibility changes, communicate those changes to the public and deal with an onslaught of calls from people relying on the program.
“It’s incredibly complex,” she said.
Plata-Nino said implementation will be uneven: Some states are already in compliance with the changes, while others will phase them in as households go through regular eligibility reviews.
USDA and the White House did not respond to Stateline’s questions about the changes.
Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, have said the cuts would eliminate waste in the food assistance program. In a June news release, he characterized SNAP as a “bloated, inefficient program,” but said Americans who needed food assistance would still receive it.
“Democrats will scream ‘cuts,’ but what they’re really defending is a wasteful program that discourages work, mismanages billions, and traps people in dependency. Republicans are proud to defend commonsense welfare reform, fiscal sanity, and the dignity of work,” Johnson said in the release.
Rural residents
Changes to work requirements will prove especially burdensome for rural residents, who already disproportionately rely on SNAP. Job opportunities and transportation are often limited in rural areas, making work requirements especially difficult, according to Plata-Nino.
“None of these bills came with a job offer,” Plata-Nino said. “None of them came with additional funding to address the lack of transportation. Remote and rural areas don’t have public transportation — they don’t even have taxis or Ubers.”
With waivers, states previously could show USDA evidence that certain areas had limited job opportunities, thus exempting people from work requirements.
“Because it doesn’t make sense to punish SNAP participants for not being able to find a job when there are no jobs available, right?” said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution and the associate director of The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative.
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans

The legislation changed the criteria for proving weak labor markets to what Bauer characterized as an “utterly insane standard,” of showing unemployment rates above 10%. (The national unemployment rate was 4.3% in August, according to the most recently released figures by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)
“The national economy during the Great Recession hit 10% in one month,” Bauer said. “Ten percent unemployment is a very, very high level. So they set this standard basically to end the waiver process.”
That change will not only affect recipients now but also will drastically impair the program’s ability to respond to recessions: Traditionally, SNAP has quickly helped people who lose their jobs. But the new law requires states to cover more costs, meaning they will be stretched even thinner during economic downturns when demand increases.
“Not only are these changes difficult to implement — and certainly at the speed that the administration is asking for — they could be devastating to the program, to residents who are in need in their states, and eventually SNAP may no longer be a national program because states will not be able to afford to participate,” Bauer said.
‘Widespread confusion’
Since July, Pennsylvania officials have been working to not only inform the public about the federal changes, but also to update information technology systems — a process that generally takes a minimum of 12 months.
“Strictly speaking from an IT perspective, we’re talking about massive systems that generate terabytes of data and are working with records for hundreds of thousands — and in the case of Pennsylvania, 2 million people,” said Hoa Pham, deputy secretary of the Office of Income Maintenance for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.
Pham said the timing of the federal legislation and lagging guidance from USDA was “simply not ideal.” But the state is doing its best to train thousands of employees on the changes and help affected recipients get into compliance by finding work, education or volunteer opportunities that meet federal guidelines.
The end of geographic waivers put the benefits of about 132,000 SNAP recipients at risk in Pennsylvania.
“It is difficult, it requires time, it requires planning, it requires money,” she told Stateline. “And I want to be super clear that H.R. 1 [the new law] delivered a ton of unfunded mandates to state agencies.”
Pennsylvania created a detailed webpage outlining the changes and will notify individuals if their eligibility is jeopardized in the coming months. Pham said those who depend on SNAP should make sure their contact information is up to date with both the department and the post office.
“As a state agency, we’re working very hard to make sure that people have accurate, factual information when it is most immediately necessary for them to know it,” she said.
Trump’s new law will limit payments to hospitals that treat low-income patients

States are implementing the SNAP changes even as the ongoing federal government shutdown might temporarily cost recipients their benefits.
New Hampshire leaders say they are days away from running out of food stamp funds. No new applications will be approved in Minnesota until the government is reopened, officials announced last week.
And the changes hit agencies already strained from staffing shortages and outdated software, said Brittany Christenson, the CEO of AidKit, a vendor that helps states administer SNAP and other public benefits.
“The result is widespread confusion among both administrators and beneficiaries, as states are tasked with integrating new compliance requirements while maintaining service continuity.
“The changes not only increase workloads for states, but they can lead to more errors and longer wait time or applicants,” Christenson said.
“Beneficiaries face a heightened risk of losing aid not because they are unwilling to work, but because they cannot meet new documentation or compliance requirements on time,” she said.
Slow trickle of changes
In Maine, the new work requirement rules are in place, but recipients have some time to meet the altered guidelines, the Portland Press Herald reported. The state estimates changes to work requirements could affect more than 40,000 recipients as soon as this fall.
The state’s Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to Stateline requests for comment. But advocates said food banks are already struggling to keep up with increased demand and decreased supply because of the high cost of food.
“They’re seeing huge increases in families and individuals showing up, needing groceries, needing food every month, some every week, and that’s before any of these cuts to SNAP have happened. So we’re really, we’re very worried,” said Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates Full Potential, a nonprofit focused on ending childhood hunger in Maine.
More than 70% of Maine households receiving SNAP have at least one person working, Korsen said. While some recipients — including those who are caretakers for relatives — cannot work, many more who are employed will struggle to meet documentation requirements.
“They call them work requirements, but we’ve started calling them work reporting requirements, because we think that’s a more accurate way to portray what they are,” she said.
Alex Carter, policy advocate at the nonprofit legal aid organization Maine Equal Justice, said SNAP recipients will be affected on a rolling basis because of regular six-month eligibility reviews. For example, a 59-year-old who previously would have been exempt from the work requirement may not be notified until next month that their eligibility status is in jeopardy.
“So people are not going to be losing their benefits this month because of those changes, which I think is the thing that is hard to explain to people,” she said. “These things are happening, but we can’t tell people this will happen to you in October or this will happen to you in January. It’s different on a case-by-case basis.”
Carter said her organization is urging Mainers to ensure their contact information is correct with the state and to remain vigilant for official communications on SNAP.
While states are forced to implement the federal changes, Carter said they should emphasize they’re only the messengers. She said Congress and the president should be held responsible for the fallout when people begin losing benefits.
‘It’s very natural to think this is a state decision, or this is a departmental decision, and to direct your anger and your frustration there,” she said. “ … In this case, this is not a state decision. They are required by federal law to implement these work reporting changes.”

Both proposals tie increases in property tax collections to inflation.
School leaders agree tax reforms are necessary but insist the changes would force them to slash budgets when they’re already at the brink.
“My district will lose almost $2 million, and I will have to cut deep to make that happen,” Fairless Local Schools Superintendent Mike Hearn said.
He added those losses will compound year by year. Hearn’s district had already cut back almost a $1 million in staffing in recent years.
“We know that we have to do something,” Springboro Community City School District Treasurer and CFO Terrah Stacy said. “We just want to make sure that we’re not the collateral damage, and our kids aren’t the collateral damage of that happening.”
Inside millage
The Ohio Constitution allows local governments to levy 10 mills (or 1%) in property taxes without going to voters. Any taxes beyond that amount need the approval of voters. Those 10 mills are known as “inside millage” — a guaranteed revenue stream that, importantly, grows with inflation.
Most other levies have a hedge against inflation. A decades-old provision reduces a homeowner’s tax rate to keep their tax bill steady, so they aren’t paying more in taxes without first approving it.
House Bill 335 would put a ceiling on the growth of inside millage.

The bill’s sponsor state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, explained the bill is meant to blunt sharp increases in Ohio’s three-year home revaluation cycle. Property tax rates might still climb, but on a gentler angle.
“Our whole goal,” Thomas said, “is to prevent that spike from a revaluation, while still in between those years allowing for some new revenue from new construction.”
But Licking Heights Local Schools Superintendent Kevin Miller said that could be devastating for fast-growing districts like his. Enrollment has swelled to 5,400 kids. More than 1,200 of them showed up in the last five years. Rising property values help the district keep up with the increase.
“However, House Bill 335 further limits even that local revenue growth for districts like ours,” he said.
Inside mills represent only about 12% of the total effective tax rate, Miller explained.
“Even if property values increase by 20% during a reappraisal, our total tax revenue would rise by only 2.07%,” he added.
Spread across the community, that increase is nominal. But as the bill is written, Miller said, they’d see an annual loss of $280,000.
In Springboro, Stacy said, H.B. 335 would cut even deeper — a loss of almost $2 million or about 27 positions.
“We already have higher class sizes than 96% of Ohio districts,” she said, “(and) low cash reserves, with just 79 days of cash on hand, and that actually drops to 44 by the end of our forecast.”
Ohio House votes to advance a pair of property tax reforms

Both administrators argued the measure punishes districts for following the rules state lawmakers wrote. And Stacy said state policy decisions have increasingly shifted the burden onto homeowners. Tax cuts for businesses have curtailed their contributions. Updates to the school funding formula accounted for rising home values, she said, but not the increasing cost of operations.
State Rep. Tracy Richardson, R-Marysville, countered, saying schools perhaps “also have to look at their spending.”
Stacy emphasized the fact that her district is the 11th lowest spending district in the state.
“We spend over $2,500 less per child than any district in the state,” she said. “So, we are very frugal and very responsible with the dollars that we’re being provided.”
Tweaking outside millage
Ohio’s decades-old mechanism for reducing property tax rates to keep property tax bills steady comes with a very important catch. House Bill 186 aims to change it.
As property values increase, tax officials apply a reduction factor, but those reductions stop working when rates have been reduced to 20 mills (or 2%). Essentially if your home’s value rises high enough, there’s nothing to rein in your property taxes, and they’ll rise in line with property values.
In 2024, more than 475 school districts in Ohio were at the so-called 20 mill floor.
The new House measure would limit tax increases to the rate of inflation in the overall economy. Like H.B. 335, it’s meant to soften the impact of rising home values, but school districts would still likely see modest increases in funding.
Among the laundry list of property tax reforms lawmakers are considering, the idea is generally seen as a reasonable compromise.  The sticking point is deciding which year to start with. As it was initially written, the bill’s inflation cap would be forward-looking, but an amendment changed that start date, making it retroactive to 2023.
Testifying alongside school officials from several neighboring districts, Fairless Superintendent Mike Hearn explained they can make the original version of the bill work.
“Our schools would use tools like attrition, cash carry over and negotiated agreements to keep costs down and keep our budgets balanced,” he said. “The amended version of House Bill 186 with the retroactive tax cuts would pose a significant financial threat to our districts.”
He argued the range of impacts in their districts demonstrate the bill’s shortcomings. Hearn’s district would lose almost $2 million a year until the next property valuation. Neighboring Strasburg-Franklin Local Schools would lose $250,000 a year on an ongoing basis. But in Lake Local, Hearn said, taxpayers wouldn’t actually benefit from the inflation cap.
“Tax reform this one-size-fits-all in a state as diverse as Ohio can create winners and losers, and the losers are going to see real reductions at their local public schools,” Hearn said.
Thomas zeroed in on school officials agreeing that property taxes had gotten out of hand to make the case for a retroactive start date. He thanked them for acknowledging those spikes “really were wrong,” and insisted even if districts will get less than they’d planned on, they’re still getting more than they did before property values shot up.
“And so now if we’re looking at when should that start,” he said, “if something’s wrong, and if our taxpayers are really in the crisis that they’re at, we should be starting that as soon as possible.”
Both measures are slated for a hearing and possible vote on Tuesday. The Ohio House has a floor session scheduled the next day, and both bills could be on the agenda.

Mike DeWine holds up intoxicating hemp product Nerdy Bears and Nerds Gummy Clusters during a press conference on Oct. 8, 2025, where he issued an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products. (Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). Ohio Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate agree there needs to be regulations that prevent children from buying intoxicating hemp products, but there was no movement last week on legislation that would regulate those products. 
DeWine recently announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14. 
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Carl Aveni granted a 14-day temporary restraining order on DeWine’s executive order. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Oct. 28.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said the 14-day pause on DeWine’s hemp ban does not give legislators urgency to pass legislation that would regulate these products. 
“I think that the governor issuing the order may have jumpstarted trying to get some resolution of the whole thing,” he said, speaking to reporters on Oct. 15. “I think that perhaps a 14-day TRO only muddies the water worse than it was before.” 
The temporary pause causes uncertainty, Huffman said. 
“With uncertainty, in one sense, uncertainty isn’t good, but it is also when things are uncertain, that’s when people are more likely to try to resolve something,” he said. “We don’t want Delta-8 products being sold to children in stores. Everybody agrees on that. There’s a lot of other details that need to be worked out.”
Ohio Senate Bill 56 is up for a possible vote out of the Ohio House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday afternoon. The bill would only allow a licensed marijuana dispensary to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements. The bill, which passed in the Senate earlier this year, would also change parts of the state’s marijuana law. 
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said there is opportunity for bipartisan compromise when it comes to regulating intoxicating hemp products and preventing children from buying these products at a convenience store or gas station. 
“Our role is to keep communities safe by finding common sense regulations and laws around intoxicating substances,” he said. “… We should be able to do a number of good, reasonable, middle-of-the-road things with any bill that deals with intoxicating hemp. We should be able to focus on keeping kids safe.” 
There are a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that would regulate intoxicating hemp products in various ways. The Ohio Senate passed a couple of bills related to regulating intoxicating hemp products earlier this year that are now in the Ohio House.
“We’re really trying to just wait and see what the House is willing to pass,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said. “A lot of these hemp products, my concern is, there’s really no regulatory scheme around them. We don’t have any way of determining the point of origin if we get a bad batch. There’s no age limit to a lot of the stuff.” 
The Ohio lawmakers should have done something regarding hemp a long time ago, he said.  
“We need to make sure that we put some very basic protections in place to make sure that if we’re going to allow this to be sold, it’s only adults that are purchasing this and it’s not in containers the children can get into,” McColley said.  
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she hopes there is a sense of urgency around passing a bill to regulate intoxicating hemp products. 
“We should set an age limit for this,” she said. “I think that’s the biggest concern that Democrats and Republicans have, is we do not want stuff like this in the hands of children.”
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

(Ariel Skelley/Getty Photos)Kansas children continue to die at a higher rate than the national average, despite a decline in recent years.
That rate is 52 per 100,000, compared with 49.8 per 100,000 children, according to the 2025 State Child Death Review Board’s annual report. That report is based on 2023 data. Black males (at 57%) died at a rate of more than twice the state average, while White/Non-Hispanic and Asian/Non-Hispanic had the lowest rates.
When factoring in the manner of death, non-natural child deaths and homicides were more than two to three times greater than natural causes, and likely to have experienced involvement from Child Protective Services. Children whose families have prior or ongoing CPS involvement, especially when parental substance use is present, face a higher mortality risk.
Something must be done.
To be clear, the premature death of any human being is tragic and should be looked at from a prevention lens. The death of a child, however, should force us all to seriously reconsider our priorities and obligation to care for the most vulnerable Kansans. This is not the time or place for a debate about abortion. This is, however, the time and place to address the loss of a child due to circumstances that are repeatedly identified as preventable.
Recommendations from the review board are not limited in scope because many factors contribute to the death of a child. These factors include prematurity, congenital anomalies, sudden unexpected infant death and suffocation, motor vehicle crashes, homicide, suicide, and drugs. In many instances there are common, often overlapping, causes. The board recognizes several systemic failures resulting in high-risk environments and situations.
We have an obligation to create the safest environments possible to ensure the wellbeing of children. When we know the risks, a commitment to harm reduction should be everyone’s priority.
A basic understanding of high risk contributed to the regulation of public water systems in this country. Unregulated water leads to a rise in waterborne diseases and poisoning from chemicals. When unmonitored, problems escalate, resulting in a system that continually increases risk levels. Some areas of the country still lack safe infrastructure and oversight to address harms caused by legacy mining contamination, lead exposure pockets and other geological vulnerabilities. Because of this continued risk, efforts are made at many levels to provide expert opinions, monitor health outcomes, and implement changes that result in safer water options for consumers.
What happens when expert advice about the health and safety of children is ignored? For Kansas children, the most preventable deaths remain preventable, instead of prevented. Children continue to die.
There were no formal laws, policies, or organizations to protect children from mistreatment before 1874. A girl named Mary Ellen Wilson changed all of that when the founder of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals argued in court that she deserved the same protection from harm that was legally afforded to animals. This case set precedent for government intervention when the health and safety of a child is at risk due to the actions of their caregivers and other adults.
It should be noted that laws to protect children did not exist before laws protecting animals. This historic oversight speaks to the necessity of entities like the State Child Death Review Board.
We can assume that many people consider the consequences of their actions on the health and well-being of children. Otherwise rates of death in Kansas children would be considerably higher. Yet when capacity to share data influencing prevention efforts is limited, when policies and programs do not support safer practices or evidence-based prevention efforts, and when recommended cross-system safeguards are not advanced, we dishonor the compassionate work done by members of the review board.
Inaction results in a death sentence for Kansas children.
The data, findings and recommendations  of the State Child Death Review Board mean little if they remain confined to reports instead of driving systemic reform. Kansas lawmakers, agencies and communities have both the evidence and the moral obligation to act. Every delay costs a child’s life that could have been saved.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/healthcaregetty2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-21 04:56:41.046951

Like so many of his impoverished peers, he came to school hungry. I think of him now as millions of other hungry children and adults in Ohio will soon see their government food assistance terminated or cut substantially this fall under the Republican megabill enacted by Congress in July.
These are the invisible people who go to your church, shop at your grocery store, send their kids to the same school your kids attend. They just don’t advertise how regularly their households have to choose between buying food and paying for rent, utilities, transportation and/or gas.
It’s embarrassing for the family who lives down the block, the veteran who socializes at the local American Legion post, the penniless older adult, the disabled person scraping by and lawfully residing immigrants with nothing. They don’t want you to notice how often they don’t eat. But they all face an imminent food crisis that anyone with an ounce of compassion cannot ignore.
Unless Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, re-open the government and pass a budget bill by Nov. 1 — that includes money for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP) — more than 1.4 million Ohioans who rely on food stamps could lose a critical lifeline overnight.   
Food stamps help the working poor get through at least half of the month. Many juggle more than one job to make ends meet but still can’t afford groceries and keep the lights on. With food prices rising exponentially, along with the cost of electricity, housing and basic necessities, the destitute need fierce advocacy in high places.
Hunger in Ohio is acute, especially among children and the elderly. Households stretched to the limit with resources are most at risk. But an exhausted single parent in Butler County with hungry dependents, who races to a second shift to supplement low wages, isn’t seen at the Statehouse or on Capitol Hill. They don’t have a voice or a powerful advocate.
Neither does the 60-year-old who marginally manages at or below the poverty line and wouldn’t eat some days but for SNAP benefits that make a thin food budget go further. Neither does the documented immigrant population (protected refugees and asylees) who has long been eligible for SNAP for nourishment in a new country. Neither does the homeless community whose struggles to exist would be even more monumental without the meager meals food stamps buy.
Not only do the invisible people lack towering champions to fight for them in state and federal government, but they are also powerless to stop the cruelty and deprivation being unleashed against them today by controlling Republicans in Columbus and Washington.
In March, the Trump agriculture department slashed federal funding to food distribution programs that supply staple food items to pantries nationwide. The cuts gutted food banks already reeling with less supply and record demand. The financial gap left by the federal government was too large for many food banks to replace with donations or private fundraising.
Food orders were cancelled. Pantries had to reduce the amount of food they gave out and were forced to drop programs that purchased food from local farmers for schools and underserved communities.
But people kept coming.
The many living paycheck to paycheck simply do not have enough cash left over after bills are paid to put food on the table. Tens of thousands of Ohio residents with budget shortfalls swallow their pride every month to get essential provisions from neighborhood food banks.
Before the pandemic, the Ohio Association of Foodbanks said the state’s 12 regional food banks were serving about 2 million Ohioans each quarter. Toward the end of last year, they were approaching 4 million a quarter. Yet in June, Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a state budget, signed by Gov. Mike DeWine, that hammered food banks again with a $7.5 million funding cut — or 23% reduction from the previous allotment.
The problem of about 1.8 million Ohioans going hungry, including over 500,000 children, didn’t go away but it couldn’t compete with a $600 million giveaway to the billionaire owners of the Browns or a generous tax cut for the wealthiest few expected to cost the state at least $1.1 billion in lost revenue.
In two weeks, the poverty-stricken many in Ohio will be on the losing end of another steal-from-the-poor-give-to-the-rich budget bill that every Republican member of Ohio’s congressional delegation, save one, rushed to enact in the summer. Like the measure Ohio Republicans voted for in the General Assembly, Trump’s godawful law gives a massive tax break to the richest 1% of Americans on the backs of the poorest with draconian spending cuts to mostly health care and food assistance for children and families.
The largest cuts to SNAP in the program’s history are now in effect with changes that include stricter work requirements — even though data shows most SNAP recipients who can work do. These eligibility alterations kick legal immigrants on protected status off food aid and shift sizable costs to states to maintain what the federal government used to fully fund. But at least the rich get richer and middle school cut-ups with empty stomachs take their tests.

(Photo by Lana Cohen/Maine Morning Star)CHINA, Maine – When Saige Bird moved to Maine, her first order of business was to get support for her then 3-year-old son, who is autistic and has a speech impediment that renders him unintelligible to most people. 
Over the past year and a half, she has struggled to get him the speech or other support he needs and is legally entitled to.
While Child Development Services — a quasi-state agency responsible for providing disability services to Maine children under the age of 5 — transitions to a new model for serving 3- and 4-year-olds, a significant number of preschoolers who remain in the existing system are being left behind.
Over the 2024-2025 fiscal year, 875 3- and 4-year-olds, or 15% of preschool-aged children served by Child Development Services, were on waitlists for 1,690 services including speech, occupational and physical therapy, according to data provided by the Maine Department of Education. Historically, Child Development Services has not kept track of waitlist data, but this is an increase from 2019, when a report requested by the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee found that 10% of children requiring services were on waitlists.
When Bird’s son, whose name she asked be omitted for privacy reasons, was first referred to Child Development Services for evaluation, Bird was thrilled.
“I thought I was gonna get the help I need for my son,” she said. 
Districts share positive signs after special education for young children shifted to schools

But that excitement soon turned to disappointment. 
Four months after her initial appointment, she received an email from a speech therapist, only to discover she was based in Texas and the sessions would be remote, which she didn’t think was a good fit for her son, then 4 years old, who is hyperactive and has a low attention span.
Another four months later, Child Development Services offered a preschool placement for her son at Augusta Children’s Center. She ultimately declined it due to, among other reasons, trouble scheduling around her son’s outside occupational and speech therapy. 
“I know some people love the Children’s Center,” she said. “But it wasn’t right for my son and our family.”
Under federal law, children are supposed to receive all services they’re found eligible for within 30 days of being evaluated.
But that deadline is not always met. 
“We are frequently hearing about waitlists and hearing that these waitlists are persisting,” said Jeanette Plourde, an attorney for Disability Rights Maine. “We continue to see parents being told in (Individualized Education Plan, known as IEP) meetings that (Child Development Services) doesn’t have the staffing, that there are no placements, that it’s just not possible to fulfill their child’s IEP.” 
This, says Plourde, is simply not okay.
“Our state has an obligation to provide these services under federal and state law,” she said. “Full stop.”

Bird is one of many parents who gave up completely and opted to find her child the services he needs in a different way. Three to five days a week, Bird drives an hour and a half round-trip to and from Belfast for in-person speech, which Child Development Services determined her son needed, and occupational therapy, which she sought separately. Since January, she has spent at least $550 on co-payments for both services.
The Maine Department of Education, which oversees Child Development Services, is well aware of the agency’s challenges, which are not new, and is working to turn the tide by transitioning the responsibility of providing preschool special education from Child Development Services to the state’s public schools, a mammoth task it says will better serve preschoolers by utilizing the state’s resources more efficiently. 
But while Child Development Services works to implement this systemic change, there’s not much that can be done for the children who aren’t getting their needs met, said Child Development Services State Director Dan Hemdal.
“It’s an unfortunate reality of early childhood special education in the state,” said Hemdal of children ending up on waitlists. 
Hemdal and others say that a lack of preschool placements and providers — including speech, occupational and physical therapists — can make it difficult, if not impossible, to match preschoolers with the resources they need.
But while the state works to create a system that better serves preschoolers with disabilities, children across the state lose valuable time.
The first five years of life are crucial for development and can shape the trajectory of a child’s life. 
“You only have a certain amount of time while the brain is this plastic,” said Nancy Cronin, the executive director of the Maine Developmental Disabilities Council. “This is a magic time for development that no child can afford to lose.”

This is what keeps us from treating politics as a zero-sum game.","This is the third of a four-piece series promoting ways Connecticut people can help overcome the political and social polarization dividing the United States. Here are Parts One and Two.
When I boarded an Amtrak train from Chicago to Washington, D.C. earlier this year, I carried with me a Chipotle bag, a heavy suitcase, and an even heavier question: Why do so many people still support President Donald Trump?


The morning after the 2024 election, my classmates at the University of Chicago had gathered in disbelief, but I was not surprised. Members of my family in Indiana had voted for him before, and the concerns I heard in rural towns last summer were not the same culture war issues dominating cable news. So I set out to the inauguration —not to endorse, but to listen.
On the train, I met Esther and Lester, retired therapists from Michigan. Esther told me she had been at the January 6 rally, so I tried to put away my own understanding of that day to be present to her worldview.

Michael Hernandez
It turns out Esther’s world was thousands of miles in diameter. She and her husband had just returned from a trip to Indonesia to meet their newborn granddaughter. They proudly swiped through photos as they enthusiastically recalled hiking through the jungle with their son-in-law’s Indonesian family —even picking tropical fruits along the way. Their love for their granddaughter was undeniable, but so were their competing world views. They were staunch Trump supporters, but they also saw a world beyond MAGA that included their new Indonesian relatives.
This pattern repeated itself. A Mexican immigrant named Pedro admired Trump for “saying what he means.” An Army servicemember named Jackson spoke less about politics and more about faith and belonging. A retired executive from Nashville confessed she had once voted Democrat, but now placed her loyalty in Trump. What united them was not ideology so much as presence. They were warm, generous, and eager to connect if I was willing to suspend judgment and ask, “Where are you from? What brings you here?”
Our mainstream culture often reduces partisan rivals to caricatures. However, my experience underscored a simple truth: no one is only their vote. People carry with them stories, families, dreams, and wounds. To dismiss them as irredeemable is to shut the door on civic trust. 
I caught a glimpse of how that trust can be rebuilt last year at Interfaith America, where I worked on the Evangelicals in a Diverse Democracy project, which tells a new story of how evangelicals might practice faith and neighborliness in a world beyond their control. Indeed, theologians like Marcus Borg, in The Heart of Christianity, invite us to see Christianity not as a rigid system of beliefs to be defended, but as a living tradition centered on transformation, relationships, and meaning. I have come to see civic life in the same way. Trust begins with presence. Listening, not to agree, but to understand, creates belonging. This is what keeps us from treating politics as a zero-sum game where our neighbors are enemies.
My commitment to open dialogue goes back to my senior year of high school in Stamford, when our AP U.S. Government and Politics teacher entrusted my class with running a school-wide mock election alongside the 2016 presidential race. Some classmates openly supported Donald Trump, yet their politics never fractured friendships. We could disagree without losing our sense of community. 
Years later, as Student Body President at the University of Connecticut during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and the divisive 2020 election, that lesson was tested. My peers were angry, isolated, and doubtful the university could hold us together. In response, I organized the nation’s first student-led conference on campus free expression and led the effort to adopt the Chicago Principles, a framework for protecting open dialogue. As a moderate Democrat myself, I felt a responsibility to show that free expression is not a partisan slogan but a civic discipline at the heart of American democracy.
That is the same practice I carry with me now in my family, at church, and in civic spaces: bridging divides not by shouting louder, but by listening longer. When I sit with someone whose views unsettle me, I think of Esther’s granddaughter, Jackson’s faith, or the students at my high school who showed up despite the tension. I remember that every person is more than their politics. That is what I am doing to bridge divides, and why I believe listening and belonging are not luxuries in this moment, but necessities for our democracy.

Ron DeSantis announces his proposed budget from the Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Heading into his final year as Florida governor with no immediate campaign on the horizon, Ron DeSantis has begun to show a more personal, reflective side to himself on social media.
From new posts on his preferences in music (Metallica), coffee (Dunkin), and sports (Stone Cold Steve Austin), DeSantis in the past 10 months has started to use his personal X account to give his fans a peek behind the curtain into his hobbies — a stark change to his past, sparsely personal use of his account.
Some hope it’s a sign of his next career.
“Governor, can you please start a call-in radio show?” one user asked.
Others are confused at the change:
“What are these tweets? You are the greatest governor of all time, but what is going on with this stream of consciousness. I get it 2028 and Vance is good with speaking from the heart. But you are a sledgehammer that’s good enough. Peace and love,” another wrote.
DeSantis has long enjoyed a distinct popularity in right-wing circles on social media. Many fans name their X accounts after him, use his face as their profile pictures, or even AI-generate images of him to represent themselves. Accounts like “DeSantis Appreciation Society,” “Cryptid Politics,” and “Frog Capital” have a combined following of more than 50,000 people, including members of the governor’s staff.
Despite this, DeSantis has largely built a reticent, insulated reputation. He’s run a more private operation, offering few tidbits about himself and the inner-workings of his administration. And while the political machinations haven’t appeared to change, his online presence has begun to shift into the sunshine.
Molly Best, DeSantis’ press secretary, told the Florida Phoenix there is “no underlying reason” for the change in pace “other than his normal interest in tweeting from his personal account.”
On DeSantis’ personal X account, the Phoenix searched from the years 2018 to the present for terms he’s expressed interest in. These includes “baseball,” “golf,” “football,” “Metallica,” “Master of Puppets,” “coffee,” “wrestling,” “Waffle House,” and “AI.”
Here’s what we found:
On music:
In 2025 alone, DeSantis has used his personal account, @RonDeSantis, to post the key word “Metallica” four times; “Nirvana,” twice; and “Master of Puppets,” four times. This compares to zero mentions in the past.
“If you compare the music/bands from the last 30 years (1995-2025) to the previous 30 years (1965-1995) it isn’t even close: From 1965-1995 you have the Beatles/Stones/Zepplin/Hendrix era; Elvis was still in the building; the rise of southern rock including Skynrd; epic country from Johnny Cash to Waylon; pop icons like Michael Jackson; mainstream rock bands like U2; metal legends including Metallica/GnR; the start of alternative rock … and so much more. Music from that era has stood — and will continue to stand — the test of time,” one deep-dive DeSantis thought from Aug. 16 reads.
On the same day, he mused, “Epic year — and it signaled the evolution from metal/hair rock towards grunge/alternative rock. I’d take Appetite for Destruction and Master of Puppets if I had to choose between albums from the mid-to-late 80s vs the early 90s.”
Also on Aug. 16, he shared, “November Rain by GnR and One by Metallica are two of my favorite music videos of all time.”
On food and drink:
DeSantis on Monday showed a preference for Dunkin’ Donuts over Starbucks, and black coffee over sugary, cream-filled lattes. He posted three times about coffee on his personal account, compared to once in 2018.
“Demand for coffee in America = inelastic,” he wrote. “People will pony up before changing their habits when it comes to that cup of Joe.”
On food, he revealed three times this year that he likes Waffle House (and prefers it to Cracker Barrel). “We haven’t been in a few months — the last time we tried there was a line of (hungover?) college students and it’s hard to wait long with three young kids so we bailed,” he wrote.
He had not posted anything about Waffle House on his personal account before this year.
On sports:
Sports are one of the governor’s most prevalent interests on social media and in press conferences. From football to baseball to golf to wrestling, he likes it all.
This year, he posted with the key word “baseball” 10 times — nine of which were in October. This compares to just one post in 2024 and two in 2018.
Many of these posts center on a perceived growing uninterest in the sport, which DeSantis played at Yale University. A star player and captain of the team, the now-47-year-old posted various analyses about why the sport may have fallen by the wayside, including a 1994 MLB strike and a slower drafting process.
“Golf” made it into 11 posts this year, 10 of them in September, compared to just two in 2024. Many weighed the governor’s favorite golf courses. DeSantis is prolific golfer, and has posted video of his young son golfing. DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis met at a University of North Florida golf course in 2006.
Wrestling, meanwhile, earned three mentions compared to zero in previous years, while “Stone Cold Steve Austin” had two.
“Maybe Stone Cold Steve Austin can be the referee and then drop a stunner on Tampon Tim at the opportune time,” he posted in March. The reference is to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
Football also saw spikes in interest from DeSantis in 2025, along with “championship,” “undefeated,” and “ranked.”
Not all of his new subject areas are apolitical, however. This year alone, he’s used his personal account to deride artificial intelligence 13 times. He hadn’t mentioned it before then.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-21 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This is UConn: Zero paid family leave for professors,Sarah Hird,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/21/this-is-uconn-zero-guaranteed-paid-family-leave-for-professors/,"UConn currently lets every pregnant/expecting individual reinvent the wheel, cobbling together a leave plan with whatever resources and departmental grace they can muster.","When I was two to three weeks postpartum (living in California), I was at home with a seemingly healthy baby but I was falling apart. 
I was getting less than 90 minutes of sleep at a time (because my baby had lost “too much” weight and I was told to feed him every 90 minutes around the clock); post-partum depression made it feel like breastfeeding a baby for the next six months was functionally equivalent to infinity and I thought I would never smile again; I had a seven inch incision healing across my lower abdomen and an itchy rash all over my body from a reaction to the anesthetic of the c-section. 
What medicine for me would be safe for the baby? Did I have mastitis? Did I eat anything today? Why is he crying? Why isn’t he crying? Why am I crying? Ah yes, because my nipples are bleeding.
Difficult postpartum experiences like mine are common following the birth of a child. Put simply: recovering from birth takes time. Bonding with a newborn takes time. Adjusting to the new reality of parenthood takes time. But these investments provide the foundations for healthy families and productive workers.
I started at the University of Connecticut with a 1- and a 2-year-old and was shocked to hear stories from faculty who had babies here. Some were back in front of a classroom before I would have even been cleared to lift my baby (the incision hadn’t healed). One faculty member was on campus when his wife fell down the stairs carrying their newborn. Another had only one day off teaching before being back in a classroom – while his newborn twins were in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in New Haven. Yet another was at the emergency room in another state with their adoptive 3-day-old son while teaching her classes, abruptly moving them online but without interruption. 
I have personally heard dozens of similar stories from UConn faculty spanning departments and decades and they all share this in common: UConn professors get zero days of guaranteed paid family leave.
UConn currently lets every pregnant/expecting individual reinvent the wheel, cobbling together a leave plan with whatever resources and departmental grace they can muster. The bottom line is that no person recovering from birth should take on the task of leading a classroom of college students. Because even standard new parent difficulties like spit-up-on-my-shirt-has-made-me-late or sleep-deprivation-has-muddled-my-brain can negatively affect students.
And while insufficient parental leave is suboptimal for students, for new parents it is downright cruel. And what do we gain from this cruelty? We get worse educators in the classroom, less creative and less productive scientists in the lab, unreliable committee members and poor decision makers. 
The administrators at UConn are guaranteed 12 weeks of paid family leave. The graduate students at UConn are guaranteed six weeks of paid leave (birthing parent). Connecticut state law ensures all workers get 12 weeks paid family leave but UConn professors are exempt from that law because of our union. I’ll say it again: UConn professors get nothing. Zero guaranteed paid family leave. 
The paid part is essential. New professors, frequently people of prime ages for starting or growing a family, have spent years on stipends and low postdoctoral salaries, likely moved across the country for their job multiple times, and thus may have started their faculty position with little to no savings.
Good professors leave UConn for a lack of family leave and resources – after we’ve invested substantial funds in their salaries and research groups. With a humane and robust and automatic (meaning, not dependent on someone judging then approving of your need) family leave policy, UConn could recruit and retain faculty of the highest caliber, while simultaneously creating a community that supports families. Everyone – from newborns to the elderly – needs care at some point. Minimizing the bureaucracy involved with meeting that need benefits us all.
This has been a fight on parents’ radars for decades but various local and national crises always let it fade into the background. Families are the fundamental unit of society and we cannot let this go any longer. Yes, it will cost money. But that’s what society is for. To invest in, to believe in a better future. 
UConn President Radenka Maric’s email signature claims: “Our expert researchers, faculty, staff, and alumni drive Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship (CIE) for a better tomorrow. We fuel the State’s economy and are committed to inclusion with emotional intelligence in benefiting the greater good. This is UConn. STUDENTS FIRST, UCONN ALWAYS. HUSKIES FOREVER.”
The moral, ethical and humane choice for a better tomorrow that benefits the greater good through inclusion and emotional intelligence (that also puts students first) is obvious: professors deserve guaranteed paid family leave. Yes. “This is UConn.” But it could and should be better.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-21 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CCSU– where academic freedom and freedom of speech collide,Jay Bergman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/21/ccsu-where-academic-freedom-and-freedom-of-speech-collide/,Freedom of speech and academic freedom are not the same thing.  Sometimes they are mutually exclusive.,"“Under the Trump Administration America is descending into the long night of fascism.”  This is the mantra of professors in Connecticut and around the country who condemn the administration’s efforts in higher education to reverse the recent explosion of antisemitism, to ensure the presentation of multiple viewpoints, and to end programs that violate the Supreme Court decision in 2023 prohibiting racial discrimination in student admissions.
To professors such as Louise Williams, president of the AAUP faculty union at the four regional campuses of the Connecticut State University system, these efforts are a violation of academic freedom and freedom of speech. In her view, they threaten nothing less than professors’ freedom to tell their students “what the evidence says is the truth and to teach the truth.”  The result, she says, is as atmosphere in which “everyone is scared.”
Apart from the fact that in many academic disciplines what is true remains a matter of debate on which reasonable people may disagree, freedom of speech and academic freedom are not the same thing.  Sometimes they are mutually exclusive.  One instance of this is when professors opine on subjects, such as contemporary politics, that bear no relation to the subject matter of the course. Professors of mathematics cannot teach literature, and professors of literature cannot teach mathematics.  So, too, should professors keep their politics to themselves.  To do otherwise is to deprive students of their academic freedom.
Professor Williams notwithstanding, it is students, not professors, who have reason to fear. Students should not have to fear that disagreeing with their professors might cause their grades to suffer.
In virtually every college and university in America, there reigns today an ideological monoculture skewed to the left.  At Central Connecticut State University, where I have taught history for the last 35 years, there are just five or six self-proclaimed conservatives on a faculty of nearly 500.  Moreover, many faculty abuse their power over students by reserving class time otherwise spent on the subject they are contractually required to teach by articulating and imposing a left-wing orthodoxy on students who have neither the autonomy nor the intellectual wherewithal to challenge.  
Over the years, but more so since the death of George Floyd and the riots and destruction it triggered, CCSU students have told me in confidence and in whispered tones how much they resent their professors selfishly shoving their politics down their throats — on illegal immigration, President Trump, non-existent Israeli genocide in Gaza, “systemic racism,” and so on.
All of this is a perversion of why universities exist — to provide students with the knowledge, drawn from exposure to a wide range of opinions on multiple subjects, they will need to prosper vocationally and in every other aspect of their lives.  But while CCSU and nearly every other university in America loudly proclaim their commitment to diversity based on race, gender, and class, intellectual diversity — the only diversity that matters in higher education — is virtually absent.
In this environment, it is hardly surprising that, for her splendid public statement deploring the murder of Charlie Kirk and stressing that “violence has no place in our society or on our college campuses,” the President of CCSU, Zulma Toro, has had to endure vitriolic opposition from many faculty who either approve of the murder — which rendered two children fatherless — or consider murder objectionable only when someone whose views they agree with is the victim.
Issuing a statement like Toro’s should not require courage.  But in today’s indecent atmosphere, in which many both inside and outside academia consider those who disagree with them not merely wrong but evil, it does.
Inevitably, the intolerance of professors has now infected their students: over one-third of 68,000 students at 257 colleges and universities in America responded affirmatively when asked by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in a recent survey if violence is a legitimate means of silencing a speaker they disagree with.


What Kirk’s murder and its aftermath show is that the rot in American academia is so deeply entrenched — among students as well as faculty and administrators — that internal reform is no longer possible.  
It is up to the American people to require universities once again to carry out their original mission of educating students by exposing them to all viewpoints, not just those their professors believe in.  Only then will college students, after they graduate, be able to perform their civic duty as knowledgeable participants in a democratic society.

They allege Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration interfered with a state board review of their work contracts and contributed to them losing their jobs.,"Former chief public defenders are suing Louisiana over losing their jobs.  (Getty Images)Four attorneys who used to lead local public defender offices are suing the Louisiana government and the state public defender over their terminations. They allege Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration interfered with a state board review of their work contracts and contributed to them losing their jobs. 
“The termination of the Plaintiffs … is primarily the result of the unlawful actions of a single person, the Louisiana State Public Defender, Rémy Voisin Starns … with the complicity of the recently installed majority of the Louisiana State Public Defender Oversight Board, at least some of whom were apparently hand-picked solely to support Starns’ illegal terminations of these contractual relationships,” wrote Rick Schroeder and Stephen Haedicke, New Orleans attorneys representing the dismissed public defenders, in a legal brief filed in East Baton Rouge Parish Friday. 
The attorneys suing for unspecified damages include Michelle AndrePont, Brett Brunson, John Hogue and Trisha Ward. AndrePont, Brunson and Ward ran public defender services in Caddo, Natchitoches and Evangeline parishes, respectively. Hogue oversaw public defense for East Carroll, Madison and Tensas parishes. 
Those being sued include the Louisiana Office of the State Public Defender, Louisiana State Public Defender Oversight Board and Starns, both as an individual and in his professional capacity as the state public defender. 
Starns first became the state public defender in 2020, when Gov. John Bel Edwards was in office, and was reappointed to the position by Landry last year. 
Starns could not be reached via text or call to his cellphone Monday, and a message left at this state office went unreturned. Landry’s office and Jeffrey Hufft, chairman of the Louisiana State Public Defender Oversight Board, also could not be reached Monday.
The lawsuit is the latest escalation in a nearly two-year battle between Starns and the former chief public defenders who disagreed with him publicly. 

Starns declined to renew the plaintiffs’ one-year public defender contracts after the attorneys had pushed back on his plan to gain more authority over the public defender system’s finances and change the pay scale for chief public defenders. 

The four plaintiffs have nearly 100 years combined of public defense experience, and none of them ever received a problematic audit or performance review while running their public defender offices, according to their lawsuit. They allege Starns has never provided the required “just cause” for their terminations and, instead, did not renew their contracts because of his “personal animosity” toward them. 

In 2024, the attorneys all publicly testified against legislation that would have transferred nearly all authority over the state public defender system from an appointed state board to Starns as the state public defender. 
After hearing opposition from the plaintiffs and several other public defense experts, state legislators pulled back from the proposal Starns had backed. They allowed a state oversight board to keep control over the pay scale for chief public defenders, approve large contracts and review terminations of chief public defenders under certain circumstances. 

A few months later, Starns tried to get a newly appointed state public defender oversight board to agree to his preferred salary model for chief public defenders, who he has said are paid too much. The board rejected the proposal, in part because some of the plaintiffs testified their pay would be cut by thousands of dollars under the new model. 

Earlier this year, Starns came back to the Louisiana Legislature for a second time with bills that would have transferred control over chief public defender pay and terminations to his position. Lawmakers refused to move the bills, with state Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, calling the proposal “a power grab.”
The plaintiffs’ lawsuit alleges inappropriate contact between Starns, the Landry administration and public defender oversight board members tasked with reviewing Starns’ decision to dismiss the attorneys.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

A committee set up by the board to review their terminations violated the state’s open meetings laws by meeting in private, according to the lawsuit. “White papers” that contained misleading statements from Starns or his staff were also shared with oversight board members, but not the plaintiffs’ attorneys ahead of the board’s vote over whether to uphold their terminations. 

Five of the nine board members who had to vote on the terminations were also replaced over a six-week period from late May to early July. In two instances, the board wasn’t able to take a vote on whether it agreed with Starns’ decision to dismiss the plaintiffs because not enough members showed up to scheduled meetings to take a vote. 

The plaintiffs allege there was “a coordinated plan to stack the Oversight Board with new members who would ignore the plain text of the law and just say ‘yes’ to the [state public defender], the [attorney general], and ultimately the Governor.”

When the board finally voted, on July 7, to uphold Starns’ decision not to renew the plaintiffs’ contracts, the five board members who voted in favor of the terminations were all the newest members of the board with less than two months experience. The four board members who voted to block the terminations had longer tenures. 
The lawsuit alleges some new members of the board were told they had to vote in favor of the plaintiffs’ terminations in order to be appointed to the panel. 

“Each new Board member was either encouraged or told to vote against the District Defenders and in favor of Mr. Starns’ position. Indeed, upon further information and belief, the appointments of at least some of these new Board members was dependent on the prospective member’s willingness to vote against the District Defenders and for Mr. Starns’ position,” Schroeder and Haedicke wrote in the plaintiffs’ lawsuit. 
The outcome of the board’s decision hinged on its newest member, attorney Medlock Harbison Jr. of Metairie, who has no experience with criminal law and was appointed to the board only a few hours before the vote took place, according to the lawsuit. 
Harbison, who was the fifth and deciding vote favoring the terminations, wore a visitor’s badge from the governor’s office on his lapel to the board vote that day. A staff member for the attorney general’s office and a person who works for the governor, who are not named in the lawsuit, also wore similar visitor badges to the meeting, suggesting they had all been at a meeting together, Schroeder and Haedicke wrote. 
Harbison also offered the prewritten board resolution backing the plaintiffs’ terminations, which was eventually passed. The lawsuit says is an indication of meddling by the governor’s office. 
“Confirming the collusive nature of the meeting in the Governor’s offices, the just-appointed-that-morning Board member immediately read a written prepared motion, which someone had drafted prior to the meeting and likely just handed to this new Board member,” wrote Schroeder and Haedicke.

(Photo courtesy Department of Energy)By Justin Doubleday
The National Nuclear Security Administration furloughed 1,400 employees Monday as part of the federal shutdown, with NNSA doing budget “gymnastics” to keep contractors on-site at critical facilities.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright said NNSA furloughed its federal workforce on Monday after running out of funding to continue paying them. About 400 NNSA employees will continue working without pay to secure the nuclear stockpile and maintain minimum safety conditions.
“This has never happened before,” Wright said Monday during a visit to the Nevada National Security Site in Las Vegas. “The NNSA, our umbrella organization, it’s been grouped together for 25 years. We’ve never furloughed workers in the NNSA. This should not happen. But this was as long as we could stretch the funding for the federal workers.”
DoE’s press office confirmed nearly 400 NNSA staff will remain working “to support the protection of property and the safety of human life.” NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation — which transports nuclear material within the United States — remains funded through Oct. 27.
Meanwhile, Wright said DoE had worked with the White House Office of Management and Budget to continue paying some NNSA contractors who run the agency’s nuclear facilities.
“We were able to do some gymnastics and stretch it further for the contractors,” Wright said.
Trump tried to lay off more than 2,000 Interior staff in shutdown plan now on hold

Wright said there are about 100,000 contractor employees across the national labs and nuclear enterprise.
“We want to keep all those people employed,” he said. “If the creative extra funding we found, when it runs out, it will be layered at different locations, but tens of thousands of critical workers, their families and our national security, become at risk.”
An NNSA employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said furlough notices went out early Monday. Staff came to the office to set up out-of-office messages, clean out waste bins and otherwise prepare to be out of the office for an undetermined length of time, the employee said.
The NNSA employee said the furlough notices are yet another blow to morale in a damaging year for federal staff. Earlier this year, the NNSA scrambled to re-hire people after nuclear security staff were abruptly fired as part of a Department of Government Efficiency-induced purge.
“The psychological toll on federal employees right now is tremendous,” the NNSA employee said.
The shutdown entered its 21st day Tuesday, tying the record for the second-longest shutdown in U.S. history, set in 1995-1996, and is all but certain to beat that mark Wednesday. The longest shutdown is the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019.
Negotiations on Capitol Hill have evaporated, with Republicans and Democrats entrenched on either side of the debate over reopening the government.
In a statement, Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.) blasted the decision to furlough NNSA employees.
“Without them, construction of modernized weapons and surveillance of the existing stockpile will grind to a halt, reducing our nuclear deterrence,” Titus said. “This is a decision our enemies will welcome. It also demonstrates that President Trump will go to any lengths — including jeopardizing our national security — to achieve his political ends.”
Meanwhile, Wright blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Democrats for the shutdown.
Wright had signaled earlier this month that DoE would soon have to begin furlough procedures at NNSA. In a response letter, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) pushed back, pointing out NNSA staff were not furloughed during a longer shutdown in 2019.
“This situation is not acceptable and should be completely avoidable,” Markey wrote to Wright. “The Trump administration has control over how the NNSA plans its operations during a government shutdown. The NNSA’s operations were largely unaffected during the 35-day government shutdown that occurred during President Trump’s first term, and DOE has previously said it did not expect any disruption to its operations from this shutdown.”

Scientific Games wants a judge to intervene in a bidding process that saw it lose the contract to Intralot, get the contract back, only to have it stripped away again by the state.","Two companies, Scientific Games and Intralot, are currently locked in a fight to see which one wins the lucrative contract to manage Maryland's lottery games. (Photo by Lee Lawson/Gettty Stock Photo)The battle over a lucrative contract to manage the state’s lottery systems is headed to court.
Attorneys for Scientific Games — which currently manages lottery gaming for the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency — is asking an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge to intervene in what it says is an unfair and illegal process that saw the company lose the contract, then be awarded a 10-year deal to continue, only to have that stripped away by the state last month in an effort to rebid the contract.
Lottery officials “cannot reject Scientific Games’ proposal directly, or indirectly by cancelling or modifying” the request for proposal, wrote lawyers for Rifkin Weiner Livingston, a firm that represented the company as lobbyists and now in the courtroom.
A lottery spokesperson declined comment Monday, citing the pending litigation.
The lawsuit, filed Friday afternoon, asks a judge to order lottery officials to move forward with its recommendation to award Scientific Games the contract. It also seeks to bar the state from rebidding the contract while Scientific Games appeals the Sept. 25 lottery commission vote that stripped it of the company of being the recommended bidder.
The company also asked a judge to rule that lottery commission officials violated a code of conduct and the Maryland Open Meetings Act.
At issue is a tortured yearlong bidding process that initially saw Scientific Games supplanted by its biggest competitor, Duluth, Georgia-based Intralot. That recommendation by the lottery agency was later upended when Intralot’s bid was disqualified for failing to meet minority business requirements and Scientific Games, the second-place bidder, was then recommended for the contract.
The 10-year deal to manage and monitor the lottery’s gaming systems, including terminals, is lucrative, worth hundreds of millions to the state as well as the winning bidder.
US DOT calls for end to race- and sex-conscious programs in Key bridge rebuild

Intralot appeared to be the winner in July, with a $260 million bid that was considered $110 million less than Scientific Games, its nearest competitor. Scientific Games, which held the contract, argues that the gaming agency failed to consider the benefits of continuing with the company, which was exceeding revenue expectations for the state.
But lottery officials said at their July 15 meeting that Intralot had the edge, based on having the lowest price. The panel voted 5-1 to recommend Intralot as the winner.
That preliminary step still required ratification by the Department of General Services and the Board of Public Works. Within days, that preliminary approval was on shaky ground.
Six days later, lawyers for Scientific Games appealed the recommendation and filed a slew of records requests. It cited a flawed analysis gave Intralot the edge. On that same day, according to the Scientific Games court filing, it was determined that two of Intralot’s minority business partners — including Alyse Cohen, owner of Long Shots, an off-track betting and sports book in Frederick — had yet to be certified by the Maryland Department of Transportation.
“In short, Intralot knew or should have known that it was not a responsive offeror and was not qualified for the award,” lawyers for Scientific Games wrote in the lawsuit.
Lottery officials deemed the lack of minority business certification “not eligible for cure” and on Aug. 1 notified Intralot that its bid was determined to be “nonresponsive and not reasonably susceptible for being selected for award of this contract,” according to a letter Maryland Matters obtained in August under the Maryland Public Information Act.
The exact reason for disqualification is unclear: Most of the letter from lottery agency Procurement Director John Lloyd was blacked out.
In a post later on its website, Intralot announced that Maryland had withdrawn its contract award “based on the alleged failure to meet the minimum required percentage of subcontracting to local contractors.”
Lloyd notified Alpharetta, Georgia-based Scientific Games on Aug. 1 that it was now being recommended for the contract award. That letter was also obtained by Maryland Matters through the state public records act.
In court filings, Scientific Games’ lawyers suggest lottery officials reneged on a deal. Besides appealing the initial Intralot award to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals, attorneys for Scientific Games also sought records under the state public information act.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Scientific Games said it was contacted by an attorney for the lottery agency on Aug. 1, asking if the company would withdraw its appeal and records request if the agency rescinded the award to Intralot and recommended Scientific Games.
Scientific Games officials agreed to the deal, and lottery officials rescinded the offer to Intralot, which followed with an appeal of its own.
Before that appeal could be heard, the lottery commission met on Sept. 25. And while it was not advertised on its agenda, the panel took up the issue of the contract recommendation for Scientific Games.
After meeting in closed session for more than 90 minutes, commission Chair Everett D. Browning Sr. acknowledged the decision by Lloyd to reject Intralot’s proposal as non-responsive. The commission then voted 4-3 to withdraw the Aug. 1 offer to Scientific Games.
Scientific Games’ lawyers alleged that Browning communicated with Intralot lobbyists outside the public eye, and failed to publicly disclose those communications. Browning should have recused himself from the Sept. 25, lawyers said in court filings, which they say would have changed the outcome of the vote.
“Thereupon, the commission arbitrarily, capriciously, pretextually, without a scintilla of evidence, and with no finding of fact, in a four to three vote, denied the award to Scientific Games, breached its representations and warranties, and failed to comply with written agreements,” lawyers for Scientific Games wrote in their court filing.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1963457814-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-20 22:17:35.453323

Publicly available drinking water tests from the Department of Public Health and Human Service’s Environmental Lab show the prison’s aging and troubled system tested positive for coliform 11 times in 2025 and eight times in 2024.
Questions about water quality have come to the surface since a reported water pipe break at the prison 10 days ago that left inmates without consistent drinking water and in some cases not enough water, according to an inmate and family members.
But water quality at the prison appears to be a longstanding issue. The Department of Corrections said it takes those concerns seriously. 
“The safety of inmates and staff members at Montana State Prison (MSP) is paramount, and any safety concerns brought to the department’s attention are addressed immediately,” Department of Corrections spokesperson Carolynn Stocker wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan. “The Department works closely with the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to ensure the safety of water.”
The facility has received seven “individual violations” since 2022. When inspections reveal issues, there is a set notification process. The violations, which follow testing, were over E. coli monitoring, multiple consumer confidence violations — a mandated water quality reporting process by the Environmental Protection Agency — as well as notifications about copper and lead.
“DEQ has informed the DOC that lead and copper values are less than federal action levels,” Stocker wrote in an email.
When there is an issue with water that requires public notification, it’s called a violation. Even things like not responding to a correction or repair request within a certain time period can be considered a violation, according to a DEQ reference sheet on federal rules surrounding coliform.
Following that notification, water facilities are asked to come back into compliance.
In an email late Monday, the Department of Corrections did not directly answer a question regarding consumer confidence report violations the Daily Montanan sent Friday. The DOC referred those questions to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which did not respond to the Daily Montanan by press time. 
There have been about 50 tests for coliform, a different bacteria than E. coli, over the past year, according to the data set. 
During those coliform tests the state also tests for E. coli. None of the E. coli tests showed the presence of that pathogen, and prison water hasn’t tested positive for that bacteria since 2000, and even then it was in non-potable water, the Department of Corrections said in an emailed response to questions from the Daily Montanan.
On Monday, inmates were handed a notification dated Oct. 10, saying that there were questions about the quality of the water supply, in this case, potentially from the infrastructure problems at the prison. Amanda McKnight, who has been advocating for inmates during the water crisis, said her husband, who is an inmate, read the statement and she transcribed it.
“Our water system recently experienced a loss of pressure, which could have resulted in contamination of the water supply,” the statement reads. “Because of the loss of pressure, it is unknown if contaminants could have infiltrated the distribution system.”
The statement goes on to say water from the prison’s supply should be boiled before usage. 
“Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and headaches,” the statement reads.
The DOC did not immediately respond to a request late Monday for comment on the boil order notification.

McKnight said her husband had severe stomach issues for six months after entering the prison. Even before the current water crisis, she was sending him extra money for bottled water, she said, and that’s been a consistent worry.
“It’s devastating to know that my husband and 1,600 other human beings along with the staff who work there are being forced to live in conditions we wouldn’t tolerate for animals,” McKnight, who shared the violations with the Daily Montanan, wrote in a message. “Clean water is a basic human right. The State has known about these water issues for years and has done nothing. This isn’t an accident, this is neglect.”
The testing data goes back decades, and prison water has tested positive for coliform 37 times since 2001. Coliform bacteria aren’t necessarily harmful, though their presence in drinking water can indicate pathogens are in the water. 
Following a water sample, bacteria is grown in a petri dish overnight, said Ben Rigby, the executive director of Montana Rural Water Systems.
If it’s a “hit” or when a sample tests positive for a specific pathogen, they’ll take several more samples, Rigby said.
Rigby was previously the Water Treatment Superintendent city of Helena’s water system and said there’s always a possibility of false positives too. Reporting out any water issues is paramount to public trust, he said.
“That’s kind of rule number one, as an operator in a public water supply,” Rigby added.
There are significant federal regulations around water quality, including the Revised Total Coliform Rule. 
“Total coliforms are a group of closely related bacteria that are natural and common inhabitants of soil and surface waters,” the rule states. “Their presence in drinking water suggests that there has been a breach or failure in the water system (for example, a hole in the pipe); and pathogens, which are disease-carrying organisms, may have entered the drinking water.”
It was unclear how high the levels were of coliform bacteria. Positive tests for coliform at the prison date back to 1981, state records show. A test on Sept. 23 of this year showed the presence of coliform in the drinking water.
In an email, the Daily Montanan asked the DOC to explain the severity of the test results and its response. A DOC spokesperson explained the process the DOC uses to meet standards but did not elaborate on the positive results for coliform.
The state samples water at the facility about three times per month, Stocker wrote in an email. Those samples are delivered to the DPHHS environmental division, which then reports the results to the Department of Environmental Quality.
“If there are any concerns with the results, Corrections works with DEQ to identify and address any problems and to ensure water meets the requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and state laws,” Stocker wrote. “This could include, but is not limited to, mitigation strategies such as boil advisories. The DOC continues to work with DEQ until a negative test result is achieved and the water is confirmed free from the contaminant.  When public notice is required, MSP posts that information in all public areas at the facility for staff and in the communal areas in the prison units for inmate access.”  
Sewer and water issues aren’t new at the prison, and last year, Montana Public Radio reported a sewage backup lasted for days.
“As a wife, it breaks me to know that my husband — and every man inside those walls — has been drinking, showering, and living in contaminated water for years,” said Ariana Smith, whose husband is also in the facility, said in a statement last week.
The National Guard has delivered thousands of gallons of water to the prison from the city of Deer Lodge. The prison is also drawing from two on-site wells, Lee Newspapers reported on Monday.

But there’s been major issues with the city of Deer Lodge’s water system as well. One of the city’s three public wells shut down following a 2013 violation for arsenic contamination.
“The two remaining wells are also susceptible to arsenic contamination due to the proximity of the Clark Fork River,” a 2024 Department of Natural Resources and Conservation environmental assessment states. “Having only two remaining production wells poses a severe risk to the City’s ability to provide reliable water service due to lack of redundant water supply.”
Deer Lodge — and the state prison — both lie within the Anaconda County Smelter Superfund Site.
Milling and smelting operations produced high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium and zinc that contaminated soil and groundwater.
Last week, the Department of Corrections said it was going to take $21 million in appropriated money from 2025 budget legislation to “modernize” the prison’s water system following the break. This work is expected to take from 60 to 90 days, the DOC said in an Oct. 18 press release.
DOC officials said they have tried to find the source of the problem, calling in multiple water experts, the state’s National Guard and a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation command team. Last week, the DOC announced in a press release that water had been restored to the Secure Adjustment Unit and units 1 and 2 on the high-security side of the facility. 
Work to stabilize water access continued over the weekend, the agency said in an Oct. 18 press release. On Monday, 13 plumbers were expected to be on site, DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in a statement. A leak was found outside the A unit in the low security side of the prison, and the DOC said maintenance staff believe repairing that will help with water pressure in units A, B and C.
Some work to excavate pipes at the prison has to be done by hand, according to the DOC.
“It seems like every time we fix one leak, another one pops up affecting the system in a different way,” Gootkin said in a press release. 
The Department of Corrections also said a Department of Public Health and Human Services sanitarian inspected the prison last week and provided technical assistance on the safety and adequacy of the facility’s temporary water system. 
“The temporary water system inspected today meets the highest standards to ensure the health and safety of MSP inmates and staff,” DPHHS sanitation Jenna Fisher stated in a DOC press release.
A DOC release said Fisher confirmed that the facility is supplying necessities — including portable restrooms, showers, and bottled water — in quantities they said exceed levels recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On Friday, the Department of Corrections announced potable water trucks supplied the prison’s food factory, allowing that facility’s cooking operations to resume.
Additionally, the DOC said Fisher observed that the prison’s kitchen is maintaining safe sanitation — water is being boiled, the release said — and laundry facilities remain fully operational. 
Construction planning is also progressing, with plans to replace the failing water system to begin this week, the agency said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MSP-facility-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 21:56:22.992500

Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García was kept zip-tied in a corner, lying on top of pee pads, and had been denied food in the two weeks before she died, according to court documents. The documents detail some of the evidence likely to be presented in cases against the girl’s mother, aunt, and the mother’s boyfriend in connection with her murder.
Police filed search warrants with the court to access phone records for Karla García, the girl’s mother, and Jackelyn García, the child’s aunt. Allegations about the abuse Torres-García endured before her death are contained in those warrants. 
On Oct. 8, New Britain police received a tip that Jonatan Nanita, Karla García’s boyfriend, had picked up a tote in the woods of a cemetery and put it in the back of his vehicle, then drove to an abandoned home on Clark Street and left the tote on the property. The tote was presumed to contain Torres-García’s body, according to the warrants.
The autopsy showed that there were no signs of recent trauma or injuries that caused her death, but she was malnourished. Karla García told police after her arrest that she and Nanita stopped feeding Torres-García for two weeks prior to her death and that they had restrained her in zip ties as punishment when she was “acting bad,” according to the warrants.
After the girl’s death, Nanita put her body in the basement of their Farmington home, but the smell of decay emanating from below was so strong they had to live with friends or at hotels, documents state.
Jackelyn García sent her sister a photo of the girl restrained in zip ties and lying on a pee pad, according to documents. Karla García told her sister that the child died on Sept. 19, 2024, more than a year before her body was found this month.
Karla García said most of her daughter’s punishments were at the direction of Nanita and that she had planned to go on a podcast to share the story of what happened. She wrote notes on her phone about what she planned to say on the podcast before she was arrested.
While DCF had involvement with the family, it doesn’t appear that the agency was aware of the 2024 abuse that ultimately led to Torres-García’s death. The agency said in a statement on Friday that the family had deceived them by having another child impersonate Torres-García in a welfare check on Zoom earlier this year. According to DCF, the family told them the child was being homeschooled and was visiting a relative out of state.
Torres-García’s case is not typical for DCF, which mostly handles neglect complaints.  About 80% of cases come to the agency because of neglect concerns, not abuse.  
Connecticut DCF is part of a growing movement among state child welfare agencies to prioritize family unification,  with varying degrees of success. Child removal has been shown to be harmful to kids’ development. Because most interventions deal with neglect rather than abuse, advocates say that the true problem in the overwhelming preponderance of cases is a strained, underfunded system that lacks services and support for families in poverty. Caseworker turnover is high, according to previous interviews with DCF officials. Advocates say families struggle to access services they need such as mental health or addiction treatment, housing and child care. 
DCF said in a statement issued last week that they first became involved with the girl’s family when she was born. At the time, Karla García was in a detention center, so the baby was placed with a relative, where she remained until May 2022, when she was 9 years old. That year, her parents sought guardianship of both Torres-García and her younger sibling, which was granted by the court, a decision supported by DCF at the time. 
The department then interacted with Torres-García “during a subsequent investigation” in September 2022 involving her younger siblings, but there was not enough evidence to substantiate child abuse or neglect. DCF closed that case in November 2022.
For the following two years, DCF says, it had no involvement with the family, although it notes that Karla García sought and was granted sole custody of Torres-García and a sibling in June 2024.
But in January of this year, allegations were again made against García regarding the treatment of Torres-García’s younger sibling. As DCF checked on the sibling and then attempted to check on Torres-García, her mother told DCF case workers that she was being homeschooled and had gone to visit a relative out of state. In response, “DCF conducted a video call with a person who (the) mother claimed to be Jacqueline.” But police have said they believe that Jacqueline had died months earlier. DCF, apparently satisfied with that call, closed the case in March 2025. 
Cases typically come to DCF’s attention when someone reports suspected abuse or neglect. The agency decides whether it merits investigation. These investigations are separate from criminal investigations and require a different burden of proof.
In Torres-García’s case, no one reported her missing, New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said. After the family’s most recent involvement and despite the severe abuse, no one reported concerns about Torres-García to DCF. Several lawmakers have called for more accountability and transparency from DCF about their involvement with the family.
Republican senators called DCF workers’ actions into question in a Friday statement.
“We need full details of this video call,” the statement from Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “We need full transparency. This is an example of why essential state employees’ remote work must be constantly reviewed, especially when it involves protecting our most vulnerable residents.”
Some lawmakers have also renewed calls to further regulate homeschooling because, close to the time of her death, Torres-García’s mother reported that her daughter would be homeschooled.
Following news that a Waterbury man who was allegedly locked away by his stepmother for over a decade had been homeschooled, the Office of the Child Advocate released a report that said homeschooling has been used to hide abuse and that Connecticut has little regulation of that system.
Online petitions have also called for more regulation of the system, suggesting periodic welfare checks for homeschooled children, among other measures.
Members of the homeschooling community have pushed back against those suggestions, saying the focus on education is deflecting attention from DCF, which they say should have acted to protect Torres-García.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/90-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-20 21:56:22.992500

Here’s why,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/10/scholarship-lawsuit-california/,Students and a right-leaning nonprofit sued UC San Diego for allegedly supporting a scholarship fund for Black students. They cited the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act as evidence to support their case.,"In summary
Students and a right-leaning nonprofit sued UC San Diego for allegedly supporting a scholarship fund for Black students. They cited the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act as evidence to support their case.


A scholarship for Black students at UC San Diego is now available to anyone, regardless of race, after students and a right-leaning nonprofit organization sued the university for discrimination this July. 
The plaintiffs argued that the scholarship fund violated a series of laws, including the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was put in place to protect Black Americans in the South. 
One of the students, Kai Peters, said he was denied access to the scholarship because he isn’t Black. Peters sent  a written statement to CalMatters through the Californians for Equal Rights Foundation, the nonprofit plaintiff. He said his rejection is an example of “institutionalized racism” — a phrase that was created in part to characterize how government institutions discriminate against Black Americans. 
“I don’t see the irony,” said Joshua Thompson, an attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented the plaintiffs. “The idea is that we don’t want government actors out forcing their discrimination.”
The university’s Black Alumni Scholarship Fund is now called the Goins Alumni Scholarship Fund, named after its founding donor Lennon Goins, according to a press release last week. The scholarship fund has awarded nearly $60 million to “more than 15,400 students” since its founding, the press release said.
The rebranded scholarship program is just one of numerous initiatives in California that have come under scrutiny in the last two years. Last summer, the Supreme Court overturned precedent that allowed private universities in the state to use affirmative action, and this year, the Trump Administration has ended numerous campus initiatives promoting diversity. . 
In March, the UC changed its hiring practices, banning its 10 campuses from requiring  “diversity statements” as a condition for employment. Now those statements are voluntary.
Other changes are more subtle. In February, Bakersfield College described its “Chicano/Latino Pre-Commencement Event” as a means to “encourage Chicano/Latino students to participate in (graduation) celebrations.” But by the time graduation rolled around in May, the word “Chicano/Latino” had been removed from that sentence.
Website indicates change of focus
The press release about the Black Alumni Scholarship Fund didn’t address the reason for the change, and a spokesperson for the university, Hiram Soto, declined to comment further.
But a CalMatters analysis of the fund’s website shows how the university changed course.
In September, the website said that the university scholarship fund was founded in 1983 by Goins to “expand educational opportunities for high achieving, civic-minded African American students,” focusing on admitted Black students with a record of “community service” and “resiliency to racial and other identity challenges.”
There was no mistake that this fund was by and for the Black community. “100% of BASF Scholars identify as Black/African American,” the website said, adding that the goal of the scholarship fund was to “increase Black graduation at UCSD from 2% to 5% of degrees awarded.”
Despite decades of scholarships, that goal remains unattained. In the 2023-24 school year, just under 3% of UC San Diego’s undergraduate degrees awarded went to students who identify as Black or African-American, according to the system’s data.
Racial discrimination is illegal in the U.S., but in California, the standard of what constitutes discrimination depends in part on whether an entity is public or private. While private entities, including nonprofits and foundations, have long offered scholarships and programs for certain racial or ethnic groups — arguing that spending money is a form of free speech — state agencies, including the UC campuses, are prohibited from any form of affirmative action after California voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996. 
To avoid legal scrutiny, UC San Diego moved the Black Alumni Scholarship Fund to the private San Diego Foundation in 1998, according to the September iteration of the fund’s website.
But in the lawsuit, Thompson and his legal team alleged that the university has remained involved in the scholarship’s operation. “Our allegations were that (UC San Diego officials) were conspiring with a private entity to get around (Prop.) 209 and the Equal Protection Clause.” Specifically, he said the university was giving the San Diego Foundation information about which students identified as Black on their college applications and that the leadership of the fund included some university officials.
The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 prohibits government agencies from using private entities to discriminate. Back then, government agencies and law enforcement, especially in the South, often used private groups — most famously, the Ku Klux Klan — to terrorize Black communities. 
By working with the private foundation to support Black students, UC San Diego is guilty of the same kind of “nefarious behavior” as the government and law enforcement agencies of the Jim Crow South, Thompson said. “This is the full tradition of our civil rights laws,” he said, citing both the Ku Klux Klan Act and more recent laws, such as Prop. 209. “We don’t want the government to discriminate against people on the basis of race.”
Soon after filing the lawsuit, Thompson said the scholarship fund reached out to his legal team and agreed to change its name and to open up applications to students who didn’t identify as Black.
He said other changes may be on the horizon. In February, the Pacific Legal Foundation sued UC San Francisco’s Benioff Children’s Hospital regarding another program aimed at minority high school students. Thompson said the San Francisco university system is now negotiating how to continue with that program too.
These negotiations happen informally, so there’s no written settlement agreement to show how universities are responding and what changes actually occur.
Today, the scholarship fund website says its applications are expected to open in 2026 to UC San Diego students who are involved in community service and those with a demonstrated “ability to overcome major challenges,” as well as other race-neutral criteria.

(Photo by Nat Herz/KYUK & Northern Journal)A note from Northern Journal publisher and KYUK collaborator Nathaniel Herz: 
Last week, I stood outside a National Guard hangar in the Western Alaska hub town of Bethel, talking with residents of the region’s villages who’d evacuated after raging floodwaters overran their homes — in some cases, floating them off their foundations and depositing them miles away. 
The flooding, stemming from the remnant of Typhoon Halong, has displaced more than 1,000 people, many of whom suffered intense emotional trauma during the storm and may never return to their Indigenous homelands. For more context, you can find ongoing coverage at KYUK, the regional public media station I’ve been collaborating with, and I published my own overview piece last week.
One of the survivors I spoke with was Jeron Joseph, a resident of Kwigillingok. Kwig, as it’s known, was among the hardest-hit villages, which also include nearby Kipnuk. Some 35% of buildings in Kwig were destroyed, while that number is 90% in Kipnuk, and at least 15 villages in total sustained substantial damage, according to regional authorities.
Jeron had a story to tell, which he did over the course of 40 minutes, as helicopters flew overhead and National Guard service members bustled past us. It’s presented here with minimal edits for clarity.  He asks that those who know him who share this account on social media or elsewhere please omit the names of the family members he mentions, out of respect for their privacy.
Expect to hear more from Jeron in the days ahead as he and other evacuees get settled in their new environment.
 A ‘knee-high’ storm turns serious

Jeron Joseph: My name is Jeron Joseph. I am turning 31 on Halloween. I’m an Alaska Native, and I’ve lived in Kwigillingok all my life. Just a quick aside, in my culture, we don’t have men or women. We have masculine and feminine roles, and I was seen as much more like a cleaner of game than a hunter.
My first memory of the typhoon — my assumption was that it was going to be like any other fall-time storm, like knee-high depth of water, which is something that I’ve come to expect.
But my aunt, as a cautious person, decided to go to the school that doubles as a community center and shelter, at the first opportunity. I, of course, waited until the water looked concerning — it looked like whitewater rapids, which I’d never seen before. I’d never seen wind hitting the water to the point that there’s a froth of white above. In that moment, around midnight, I made the decision to start packing a backpack. I called my best friend so that I could string my thoughts together, get the most crucial things. A change of clothes, my legal documents and some painkillers, my toothbrush, head out the door. I had also put a harness on my dog, my little prima donna Jack Russell terrier mix. I got a harness on her, put a leash on, put my backpack on, and I took one step out the door.

The wind hit my back and pushed me onto each stair of my little deck, until I hit the driveway and I fell on my hands and my body, and my dog fell to my right side, but she was okay. I started walking in knee-depth water, with my boots getting filled. And on my way down to the school, I felt a log — a firewood log that Native people stack, like, next to their houses — it hit my left knee. It began pushing me, making me slide on the wooden boardwalk that we walk on in our villages to stay above the soggy tundra. I reacted just in time to push it away. I was just a few inches away from the ground. And I’m certain that, if I hit the ground, I would have fallen and ended up horizontal and gotten swept away, and would have been unable to pick myself back up. Because the water was at that speed.
 An ‘orchestra from hell’ at the neighbors’ house

My neighbor, three doors down from me, looked at me with his headlamp. He yelled at me to get inside his house. I got inside with the family there. They were kind enough to host me and my dog, which I’m very grateful for — and the matriarch of that house, you know, she is much more a Native than I am, and she gets nervous around dogs. One of her daughters gave me a pair of pants after my own got soaked, and we stayed there for the entire morning. Unable to sleep, we sat in the dark with candles, without power. They were commiserating amongst themselves, all of them with social media on their phones, tuned to existentially terrifying sights of their fellow Natives in the village and in Kipnuk. They had all racked their brains over how they might end up. But the way that my brain works, I clamp everything down, and I put myself on autopilot. I make my own feet move; I’ll think about my thoughts later.
The water kept rising and rising, and I would guess that it hit the crux of its height at 5 a.m. and it stayed that way until just after daylight broke, at which point it seemingly started to recede. Just after the crux, we could hear their larger wooden logs dancing against the floor of their elevated house, which has an iron foundation. It was a combination of whooshing winds, rushing water, and these hellish, very low drums against the floor — sort of an orchestra from hell. Eventually, they drifted away, log by log, and now it was just the water and the wind, and sometimes the house would shake. I’m certain I was not the only one who was scared that some part of the foundation would give, and either water would get in from the door or the windows, or the house would begin to drift. Neither of those things happened, but it happened to other houses — to a lot of the houses that were developed much earlier than those that were specifically made with this kind of situation in mind, including my own parents’ house. My childhood home.
Some time after sunrise, maybe 10 a.m., the water receded to a few feet behind the house, and we could see the impression in the tundra where the boardwalk used to be — it had floated about eight feet over. I really didn’t want to think it, but I hated how pretty the sunrise was that morning. It seemed as if beauty and our footing had been stolen from us.
 Looking for my family

My brother and my stepdad, who were in my childhood home at the beginning — they must’ve had my attitude about what they thought this was at first, just another fall-time knee-high storm. They decided to stay at the house, which was closer to the coast than my aunt’s house where I stay.
Water started coming in through their door. I know my brother had been taking five-minute, intermittent naps sitting on a freezer that was shoved against the front door. He had wrapped his most important things in plastic. My stepdad, I would have to guess, was going around the house, doing all of the other things as the patriarch of the house would do: looking at all the windows, looking at the places where the wall meets the floor to see if there’s any water coming in. They said that initially, they didn’t realize they were moving. My brother told me that at some point there was another house with an internet satellite on it, and that satellite hit one of their windows, and it actually closed the window after it hit theirs, and they were hooked together that way. That’s how they moved along together. After that whole ordeal, their house settled on a piece of land, where there was water around it.

I heard that they were physically okay, but roughed up — someone said they’d been rowing back in an aluminum fishing dinghy after the storm, with bags of their stuff. After the wind had subsided, and without telling anyone, I walked to the north bridge of the village, past all of the debris, and I looked around the horizon. I asked a person there if they’d seen my family. They said no. I looked at the horizon for some minutes, where some of these floating houses had come to rest — of course, anyone would recognize their childhood house, and I didn’t see mine. Somebody told me that it probably drifted in another direction, because the storm winds blew toward a little more east than just directly north.
So, I went back to the school, I washed my hands, I had a little meal. After the meal, I could not sit still. I walked out to the east side of the village. There’s two rows of elevated housing developments where their foundations have aluminum sheets all around them. These are older than the one I sheltered in, but younger than my parents’ house. That’s where my best friend who lives in Kwig was for the night, and when I asked him, he told me that at his place, the water got to just two feet high. When I heard that, I had the intense urge to make him go skydiving so that he’d be as scared as I was.
On my way to that east housing development, I asked every person or group I saw if they’d seen my stepdad, my brother, or my house. They all said no. And when that many people say no, you get that little bit of hope chipped away and chipped away until your heart just gets really heavy.
I made it to the housing development, and after a very quick, relieved hug and exchange with my friend, I began walking back to the school. I’d taken 10 or 15 steps out of the development when somebody yelled my name, ‘Jeron!’ They told me that my stepdad and my brother made it to the school.
 Processing my family’s survival

I didn’t let it all out at that moment. I opened the jar of fear, anxiety, hope, despair, grief, and displacement in that moment for, like, a second. Tears started welling up. I closed the jar back up again, started focusing on myself again, and started walking towards the school. After I made it inside, there were some neighbors seated against the wall and away from staff scrambling about. Some were waving at me hastily, loudly whispering to me. They said my name, and they pointed to where my brother and stepdad were.
They were locked in a makeshift exam room. My stepdad, along with a health aide, was tending to my brother, who was having, like, the only panic attack I’ve ever seen in my entire life. I went up to the window of the exam room, and that was the moment that I couldn’t control opening the jar of all those feelings.

And in that moment, I felt every feeling I should have up to that point, combined with hopeless concern and longing for their safety. I thought every thought I should have thought up to that point, like: There’s at least four or five reasons I shouldn’t be here, alive, and weeping. I spent at least 20 minutes at that window just crying my eyes out and feeling needles and knives in my heart. And my thought was, they’re alive, but I can’t see them. They’re alive. I can’t see them.
I went back to one of the classrooms where we had basically set up camp, cheeks still wet. I sat down in the corner and I just shut down mentally. The room was vacant. Distant hums of the school generator, occasional hurried jogging in the hall, and overseers yelling about some developments were all that was in the air. I sat there for what felt like 20 minutes, until somebody came by the door and noticed me staring into space. They asked me why I was sitting with the blankest stare they ever saw for over an hour. There was just nothing occupying my mind.
When that person came and asked me, I snapped out of it. I got up quickly and jogged past them, and I went back to the window where I could see my stepdad and my brother were, and my brother was lying down, face down. Silent. But breathing softly. My stepdad was having some kind of quiet conversation with that health aide. That was that moment where I asked myself, ‘Will I ever be able to see my brother again like the way he was before?’ That, of course, brought another wave of anxious tears.
A little later on, I had resigned myself to pacing some ways away from the cafeteria. They had dispatched rescue helicopters to pick up some of the other people who needed to be lifted up and brought to the school. One of my aunt’s best friends had to be brought in, either with a helicopter or a boat. When she came in through the front door, she was wailing, and it was probably because she herself was at a floating house all night, and this was probably the first time she was on solid ground since the entirety of the dark. A few people went up to hug her, but when she saw my aunt, they had embraced each other tightly, and neither of them could let go for a solid six or seven minutes. This still makes me emotional, just thinking about it.
Another hour or two had passed. Some people had asked me to check some books in the library so I would stop tensing; the library was right next to the makeshift exam room. On my way into the library, the exam room door opened, and I saw my brother standing up. He noticed me, then started walking towards me, arms outstretched. I stopped in my tracks. I couldn’t move anymore. I was beginning to burst into tears. He walked towards me and embraced me. He was back to his normal self. He was just smiling when he came up to me. That was the moment I experienced immeasurable joy and relief, after an entire night and day of tension. I was streaming tears, and I whispered into his ear, ‘I was walking all day. I was looking for you. Nobody said they saw you.’
 A couple of ‘days of delusion,’ then reality hits

From that moment, we had what I can only describe as a comfortable couple of days of delusion. There’s aid coming in. We are so, so grateful for the aid, and the donations that came in in the days after. Those donations got our heads above water. We had all of our persons. We had our mental faculties. Me and my aunt had our things, or at least as much as we could salvage. I’m a little more attached than she is to my avocation — I have eight years-worth of my sheet music I composed on a computer that I managed to get out.
We all had this thought in our heads that we were going to be able to get back to our lives the way they were. But then more and more, little bits of news from the National Guard, and from the search and rescue members, kept coming out. ‘The south side of town, so much of it smells like stove oil or gas.’ There were a couple of National Guard members, I heard that the fumes were giving them headaches, just being over there. A fellow Native said that those spills are probably going to pollute the fish and game. As that news was passed around, we all said to ourselves, ‘We are facing winter right now.’

I would describe it as when somebody drops a bag of flour on the floor, and there’s particles everywhere. That second day, it felt like the particles had settled down, and we could all see clearly. Only, what we could see clearly was not a future for us on this coastal tundra. Our ancestral home.
I spoke to a number of young people. I said to them: It feels like you only have one direction you can go to right now. You have blinders on. But I promise, when it’s all said and done, when all of the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed, you have all of your stuff and you get out — when all that’s done, you’ll have every other direction you can look toward.
I told them: Do not give in to hopelessness about something like this. Cry when it’s time to say goodbye to our home. I said to them, cry as much as you need to. Because if you don’t cry now, it’s going to manifest in other ways if you don’t get those tears out. When those tears have dried, on that holy ground where our ancestors had taken hold, you’re going to have smiles when you’re settled somewhere else.
 Leaving the village feels ‘permanent’

They loaded us onto a helicopter. The state trooper said one to two bags per person. I was a little nervous that I wasn’t going to be able to bring my stuff. I insisted on two things. One, that our dog flies to a kennel in the Bethel animal shelter, and we see where we go from there. And I really wanted to keep my sheet music that was on my computer, because there’s eight years worth of it. I still don’t know if we’re going to be able to go back to salvage stuff, which may be out of our own pockets. So, I got my dog and my computer out.
A situation can be many things. It can be horrible, it can be displacing. It can make you doubt whether you’ll see your next meal or your family. But I also told my family: This is a chance for everyone, even those unaffected, to prove what they’re capable of. If you’re going to place a hashtag on this, the ones that come to mind are #AlaskaStrong, #KwigStrong, and #KipnukStrong. That’s what I believe we should be able to get out of all of this. And that’s something that no typhoon in the world can take away.

I myself, I’m going to a family member’s house, further inland. It feels permanent. But my discussions are not done. My aunt mentioned that since the house only shifted a few inches, there’s a possibility she’s considering that we could have it as a summer home, when it’s greenest. It’s so lovely out there. You have no idea. Our house had the best views of any house on the north side of the village, and I loved those views, especially in the morning. I took some nature photographs, some pretty crazy shots, including one in the early morning where there was a layer of fog that was obstructing the sun. I think only photographers will get this, but that fog created a 100% natural, diffuse light on all the plants.
I’m going to miss that coastal air. Smells like nothing else I’ve ever come across. I’m going to miss the rain water, for drinking. And, of course, I like to think that the bonds we have with our neighbors all around Alaska, and everywhere, are stronger than displacement. And just that purity of the environment, and our way of life that we’ve rooted ourselves in for so long — our subsistence and our gathering.

Those that are lucky enough to move to similar villages to friends or relatives, or Native-adjacent small towns, I’m very envious of them. But I and my aunt, we’re going further inland. And I am very grateful. I’m here with my life. She’s here with her life. We’re here with our stories. We’re here, and we have what we need, and we’re going to find our footing again.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The legal battle over Utah’s redistricting process and what congressional boundaries should be used for the 2026 election is reaching a new fever pitch — with more complexity and uncertainty than ever. 
As a Nov. 10 deadline looms for 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to pick a new congressional map, a flurry of court filings have flooded her court docket over the past week. On Thursday and Friday, she’s scheduled two days of evidentiary hearings. 
In the filings, legislative attorneys and plaintiffs in the state’s ongoing court-ordered redistricting process argue over their preferred maps, their dueling redistricting experts, and what statistical tools should — and shouldn’t — be used to determine partisan slants or gerrymandering. Both sides are calling each other’s maps partisan gerrymanders. 
Redistricting: Utah GOP moves to block changes to electoral map, undo voter-backed law 

Meanwhile, unchartered legal waters are becoming increasingly murky as the Utah Republican Party mounts an effort to both block the map the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature advanced earlier this month (which the party also encouraged Republicans to support as the least damaging option) — and pursue what’s called an “indirect initiative” to overturn the state’s independent redistricting law.
If successful, that indirect initiative could force lawmakers to take an up or down vote on repealing Proposition 4, the 2018 voter-approved law that requires an independent redistricting process, which the courts recently deemed is now the law after determining the 2021 Utah Legislature acted unconstitutionally when it undid it to draw the map adopted that year. 
Legal fight over indirect initiative 
The lawsuit’s plaintiffs are urging Gibson not to pick the Legislature’s chosen 2025 map, known as map C, pointing to expert analysis alleging it “favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats to an extreme degree.” Meanwhile, plaintiffs are also asking the judge to block the GOP’s indirect initiative, arguing that even if they succeed in gathering the required 70,374 signatures by Nov. 14, an indirect initiative doesn’t have the power to unravel what more than half a million voters  supported and enacted in 2018. 
Anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs allege lawmakers have violated the Utah Constitution again

“A mere 4% of voters (70,374) cannot convert an unconstitutional legislative repeal of Proposition 4 into a constitutional one through a vehicle — the indirect initiative — with no constitutional genesis,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “To conclude otherwise would be to allow the Legislature (to) enact by a statute a mechanism to violate the People’s constitutional rights.”
The Legislature’s attorneys, on the other hand, argue that both of the alternative maps plaintiffs have submitted to the court are partisan gerrymanders. 
“At best, (the plaintiffs’) plans are not as fair as the 2025 (map) and, at worst, their plans are themselves purposeful partisan gerrymanders,” legislative attorneys wrote, adding that the upcoming evidentiary hearing later this week, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, “will confirm why the 2025 (map) is lawful and Plaintiffs’ proposals are extreme partisan outliers.”
Plaintiffs have also filed another complaint asking Gibson to block a companion law legislators passed alongside their 2025 maps that requires three specific tests to determine whether a congressional map unduly favors or disfavors a political party. 
Plaintiffs allege those tests were “cherry picked” to “infect” Proposition 4 with methods that will favor majority parties in states like Utah that have a dominant majority party. Legislative attorneys, however, argue the tests have merit, and were the result of legislators’ “good-faith effort” to clarify “vague” terms in Proposition 4 and exercise their discretion to determine which tests would be best to use.

What could happen next? 
Each outstanding legal question could have major implications for Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process. 
If Gibson picks the Legislature’s map C, but the Utah GOP’s application for the citizen referendum on the map is successful, that could leave the state in limbo with a big question mark over which map would govern the 2026 elections, since the courts have already voided the 2021 map as the result of an unconstitutional process. 
To successfully put the map referendum on the ballot, the party must gather more than 140,000 valid signatures (or 8% of the number of active voters statewide and in 15 of the 29 Senate districts) in 30 days, but no later than Nov. 15. Clerks will have 21 days to verify signatures, but voters will also be allowed up to 30 days to remove their signatures. 
If the referendum application qualifies for the ballot, the lieutenant governor would block the map from being used in the 2026 election, until voters could weigh in. 
However, the party’s signature gathering window wouldn’t end until after Nov. 10, which Utah’s top election officials have said is the latest possible deadline to give county clerks time to set their precincts ahead of the 2026 elections. 
If Gibson picks one of the plaintiffs maps? Republican lawmakers have already indicated they’ll fight the decision tooth and nail, arguing there’s nothing in the Utah Constitution that allows a judge to pick a map over one drawn by lawmakers. The plaintiffs, however, argue redistricting cases in other states set a strong legal precedent for a judge to pick remedial maps when legislators fail to follow the law.
There’s also legal uncertainty around the indirect initiative. 
If the Republican Party’s effort succeeds, that could push the Utah Legislature to repeal Proposition 4 and its independent redistricting commission — but likely not until lawmakers’ 2026 general session begins in January, well past the Nov. 10 deadline to set a 2026 map. 
And it remains to be seen whether the judge agrees with plaintiffs that an indirect initiative can’t trump a voter-approved ballot initiative. 
Dueling redistricting expert reports
In addition to sorting through these legal questions, Gibson must also wade through hundreds of pages of dueling analyses from redistricting experts retained by both the Legislature and the plaintiffs.

Their slate of experts are at odds over which maps are fair and which statistical methods are best suited for a politically “lopsided” state like Utah with only four congressional districts. 
For the Legislature, three experts have filed declarations: Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics; and Jonathan Katz, professor of social sciences and statistics at the California Institute of Technology. 
The plaintiffs have retained the following experts: Chris Warshaw, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University; Jowei Chen, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and Kassra Oskooii, an associate political science and international relations professor at the University of Delaware. 
Pointing to Chen’s expert analysis, which compared map C with 10,000 computer-simulated maps, plaintiffs wrote it showed that “over 99.9% of simulations create one Democratic-leaning district including northern Salt Lake County, and three Republican-majority districts – reflective of Utah’s political geography and makeup.” 
“By contrast, Map C cracks Salt Lake County’s Democratic voters in half creating four safe Republican districts, a result almost never observed among neutral simulations programmed to follow Prop 4’s neutral criteria,” they wrote. “Map C is thus an extreme outlier and exhibits a ‘statistically significant degree of electoral bias in favor of the Republican Party.’”
The plaintiffs also argued Chen’s report showed Trende’s methods to assess map C’s partisan intent was “deeply flawed” and was “infected with partisan bias from start to finish.” 
Trende, in his declaration, defended his methods while arguing that Proposition 4 “clearly, in my view, forces the legislature to adopt partisan bias as one of its standards, as it is the only standard that truly measures symmetry.” 
“Plaintiffs suggest that I have cherry-picked the standards that Utah could meet in order to enable a Republican gerrymander,” Trende wrote. “To be clear, this is false. I employed partisan bias because I believe Prop. 4 mandates its use.”

Trende also disputed claims that he drew maps with the “purpose and intent of favoring Republicans and disfavoring Democrats,” calling them “untrue.” He said the final maps considered by lawmakers were based on maps drawn by computers. “Not only were they not drawn with partisan intent; they were drawn by machines deprived of any partisan information.”
Additionally, Trende wrote that map C creates “two districts that are more Democratic than a very competitive district from the prior decade which is inconsistent with any claim of a ‘free-rein’ Republican gerrymander.”
“In short,” Trende wrote, “Plaintiffs seek to replace a map with two competitive districts with one engineered to contain one safely Democratic district.”  
In contrast, Chen’s analysis said map C’s “creation of four Republican-favoring districts clearly goes well beyond any ‘natural’ level of electoral bias caused by Utah’s political geography or the political composition of the state’s voters because Map C is such an extreme statistical outlier in terms of its partisan characteristics when compared to the 10,000 computer-simulated plans.” 
“It creates more Republican-favoring districts than 99.94% of the simulated plans,” Chen wrote. “This extreme, additional level of partisan bias in Map C did not follow from Utah’s political geography and can be directly attributed to the map-drawer’s efforts to favor the Republican Party.”

But as officials release little information about the raid — which about 200 local, state and federal law enforcement officers helped with — advocates who were at the scene are denouncing the aggressive tactics they say they saw used. 
At a news conference Monday organized by the ACLU of Idaho, advocates said that everyone attending the venue in Wilder was detained, children were zip-tied, and people were struck with rubber bullets.

Jeanette Orozco described what she said she saw while she waited for her dad to be released.
“We saw piles of zip ties on the floor. We saw people being put into vans,” she said at the news conference, as counterprotestors blared audio from a speech by President Donald Trump. “We saw people being put into buses.”
In a news release Sunday, the FBI said four people were arrested and charged in law enforcement’s execution of a federal search warrant at a horse racetrack site in Wilder called La Catedral Arena. 
The FBI canceled a news conference planned for Monday afternoon, where an FBI agent and Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue were planning to speak. 
ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales condemned the tactics.
“The government came in full force, military-style, helicopters, drones and arrested and handcuffed, everyone … including children,” Morales told reporters at a news conference near the Canyon County Courthouse in Caldwell. “No person, no Idahoan, no American should ever accept whenever a government does this to its own people.”

 What the FBI has said

About 200 law enforcement personnel helped with the raid, the FBI said, including personnel from U.S. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement; Homeland Security Investigations; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Caldwell and Nampa police departments; the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office; Idaho State Police and the Idaho Department of Correction. 
FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker said ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division helped “process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation. Their presence was limited to that specific federal responsibility and was separate from the criminal gambling investigation being led by the FBI.”
Barker said the FBI’s news conference was canceled because law enforcement officials didn’t have more information to share publicly beyond a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The document details the investigation, but does specify law enforcement’s tactics during the raid. 
“As this case moves through the judicial process, we will continue to provide updates when appropriate,” Barker said in a statement. 
 Immigration attorney says everyone attending was detained

Nikki Ramirez-Smith, an immigration attorney who said she was at the raid, said it appeared everyone at the venue Sunday was detained — including children. 
“We do have credible information that the children were zip-tied and tied up and handcuffed,” she told reporters at a news conference. 
She said many people remain detained, including some who have no criminal history. She said it appears all children have been released. 
“I think there is going to be a lot of children in this community that are severely disturbed and upset about what happened. And I think the community needs to rally around those kids — because this was a family event,” Ramirez-Smith said. “There were toddlers there; there were 5-year-olds there. There were a number of little children who were detained, and watched a very horrific and traumatic event that I think went way beyond what was necessary.”

Ramirez-Smith said she also witnessed personnel in military uniforms that looked like the National Guard. Idaho National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Christopher Borders told the Idaho Capital Sun that the Idaho military unit “did not have any Guard personnel there.”
The FBI could not be immediately reached for comment on the raid tactics. 
 What the FBI’s criminal complaint says  

In a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho on Oct. 15, FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan detailed the investigation into the Wilder horse racetrack that appeared to follow a tip in February.
The complaint alleges five people were involved in the illegal gambling business at La Catedral Arena including Ivan Tellez, who allegedly owns the property and administered the operation. The FBI’s criminal complaint says Tellez is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. One person named in the criminal complaint was not listed in the FBI’s arrest announcement Sunday. 
Morales, with the ACLU of Idaho, said law enforcement could’ve taken a more strategic approach. 
“But they chose to do it in the harshest, most inhumane way — by using the entire force possible, including military operation-style, to conduct this operation. What’s left now is trauma,” he said.

Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste says that in response to increased political threats against public officials nationwide, the agency has redirected an existing state intelligence post to focus more directly on protecting Washington’s legislators.
During an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Batiste told host Austin Jenkins that a person at the Washington State Fusion Center has been tasked with monitoring potential threats “that could occur to legislative members in session or out of session.”
The change followed the June 14 killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Batiste said the state patrol is adapting its threat monitoring and intelligence coordination to keep pace with a more volatile political climate.
While no one was injured during an Oct. 5 break-in at the state Capitol in Olympia, Batiste said it underscored the importance of keeping people who serve the public safe.
The Fusion Center is jointly operated by the state patrol and federal partners. The center is part of a program created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to improve communication among law enforcement, emergency management and homeland security agencies nationwide. 
The newly refocused role within the center, Batiste said, helps identify and assess threats directed toward lawmakers both at the Capitol and in their home districts.
A broader goal, Batiste said, is to ensure the center operates around the clock.
“We have ongoing conversations about the need to do what we can to fully ensure that the fusion center is stood up as a 24-seven, 365 operation,” Batiste said. “It is not. We need to ensure that that’s an ongoing set of services.”
For now, the center can activate after hours when needed. But Batiste said the goal is a permanently staffed operation capable of responding instantly to emerging threats — especially those that arise outside business hours. 
“It heightens our awareness of the need to be vigilant at all times,” Batiste said. “And to ensure we have the information and coordination needed to protect those who serve the public.”

Meanwhile, roughly 576,000 Kentuckians may go without food benefits in November as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to run out of funds in less than two weeks if the government shutdown persists.
While the shutdown continues, Beshear said, Kentucky will also not receive funds for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — known in Kentucky as KTAP — which provides modest monthly payments to about 15,000 impoverished families with children.
“It appears at least as of today, we will not receive those funds from the federal government,” Beshear said Monday. The state is going to foot the costs for November, but cannot guarantee anything beyond that, Beshear said.
But the state cannot afford to pick up the costs of SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, if the federal funding is not there, Beshear said.

“For November, more than 600,000 Kentuckians rely on SNAP. That’s 1 in 8 of our people, many of which are children,” he said. “This is a scary and stressful time, and team Kentucky is committed to processing benefits the moment the federal government provides the funds.”
Kentucky is already dealing with high levels of food insecurity. According to a report from Feeding America, about 17% of Kentuckians had a shortage of food in 2023. 
‘Rebuilding trust’ 
Republican state lawmakers criticized Beshear for not moving to fill the funding gap in meals for seniors last month after the administration notified Area Development Districts, which administer state programs for seniors, of an expected shortfall in the meals budget. 
The temporary funding that Beshear announced Friday comes from a previously-funded study that never took place and will help fund senior meals through the fiscal year, Beshear said. 
The legislature will need to retroactively approve the transfer of funds when it returns to Frankfort for the session in January, he said. A Senate Republican spokesman said that is expected to happen. 
“No Kentuckian should face hunger,” Beshear said. “And while I’m glad we found a temporary solution, we must ensure that we understand our people’s needs, as well as the cost controls and procedures for the senior meal program to appropriately budget and run these programs in the future.” 
Using  extra funding provided by Congress during the pandemic, Kentucky expanded meals for seniors, including providing meals for pickup, and eliminated waitlists for meals.

Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, the co-chair of the Legislative Oversight and Investigations Committee, said in a Friday statement that “the focus must be on getting meals delivered quickly and rebuilding trust with those who administer this critical program and the elderly Kentuckians who rely on it.” 
The program provides nutrition services to people 60 and older and their spouses, according to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Meals are also delivered at home to people 60 or older “who, due to illness or incapacitating disability, are unable to attend a congregate site and have no one in the home able to prepare a nutritious meal on a regular basis.” 
Background: ‘Seniors…don’t have food to eat.’
Monday’s funding transfer happened after multiple calls from Republicans in the legislature asking Beshear’s administration to find the funds. Beshear said that the transfer took so long because “there was no ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funding available” and because the state is facing a projected  $305 million revenue shortfall. 
“We’ve got to cut all the areas, because the law says we live under a balanced budget, just like each and every one of our families,” Beshear said. 
On Sept. 8, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ Department for Aging and Independent Living notified  Area Development District directors of a funding shortfall in the senior nutrition program. 
“Due to reduced federal funding and other recent federal policy changes, fewer dollars will be available and more responsibility will be shifted to states,” that letter said. It directed districts to prioritize older adults with the highest nutritional needs, reduce or stop drive thru senior citizen center meal services to maximize nutrition dollars and more. 
A Sept. 18 news release from Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency (KIDPA) said each development district would work “to assess what these funding reductions mean for their communities.” 
Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Benton. (LRC Public Information)
“The loss of funding to support the senior nutrition programs in the KIPDA region is going to have a dire impact on some of the most vulnerable members of our communities,” Jarrett Haley, KIDPA executive director, said at that time. “KIPDA is committed to working with our dedicated network of providers to minimize the harm to the seniors that rely on these services.”
Lawmakers also called on Beshear to address the problem. During an Oct. 9 committee meeting, Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said there were “seniors calling my office … who don’t have food to eat” and asked why Beshear had not called a special session to address the problem.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa farmers are near the end of harvest season for corn and soybean crops following yet another week of above-average temperatures in the state. 
While crop progress and condition reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture have not been issued since the start of the current government shutdown, reports from past years show farmers are typically more than halfway done with corn harvest and more than 80% complete with soybean harvest at this point in October. 
In 2024, Iowa farmers had harvested 68% of corn acres and 91% of soybean acres for the mid-October reporting period. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement that harvest  was “on pace this year and maybe even a little ahead of schedule.”

Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Lehman, who farms organic corn and beans in northern Polk County, said he finished his harvest last week. He said his harvest “came early” because of disease pressure, largely Southern corn rust, that made the corn mature and dry down quicker than usual. 
“Those same issues meant that the top end of our yields was taken away by that disease pressure,” Lehman said. 
He said he has heard similar reports from other farmers — they’re out harvesting lots of corn, but yields are down. 
Soybean yields for Lehman, and he said for other farmers he has spoken to, have been “really strong.” 
Lehman said while his farm had some precipitation in the past week, he has heard from a lot of farmers that their fields are drier than they would like for them to be heading into the winter season. 
A climate report Monday from State Climatologist Justin Glisan said stations across the state reported showers of a couple of tenths of an inch of rain to a little over one inch of rain throughout the week. The statewide average precipitation was 0.55 inch for the week. 
Glisan also reported temperatures were unseasonably warm during the past week. The statewide average temperature was 61.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 10 degrees above the climatological normal. Some areas of the state, mostly in the southern regions, saw positive departures from the normal as much as 14 degrees. 
Iowans can expect similar precipitation amounts in the coming week and slightly cooler, though still warmer than normal temperatures, according to forecasts from the National Weather Service. 
Trade tensions in the ag market 
Lehman said his soybean market, as an organic producer whose product usually stays domestic, is fairly normal this year. 
He said, however, that most Iowa Farmers Union members don’t grow organic soybeans and are seeing fluctuating prices that are “way below” the cost of production. 
“For every bushel we’re producing, we’re anticipating we’re losing money,” Lehman said. “To be honest, if the goal is to get to more trade deals that are more fair for farmers and workers, we’re not seeing any progress on that front.” 
Trade war tensions between the U.S. and China are one of the major issues plaguing the soybean industry this season. China, which is usually the largest soybean buyer in the world, has not purchased any soybeans this year from the U.S. 
President Donald Trump has said he will provide aid to farmers who have suffered from the decrease in trade, but exact details have not been made public. Some reports have said the funding will come from a combination of the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation fund and from the revenue the U.S. has accumulated from imposing tariffs on other countries. 
Lehman said a bailout from the government would be a “small bandage on a large wound.” 
“In addition to that, the long-term damage that comes from this trade policy is very concerning,” Lehman said. “Farmers, for years, have been working to build up trade markets around the world by being reliable trade partners. Having a chaotic trade policy means that we lose some customers that don’t come back anytime soon … a trade bailout package can’t fix that in any meaningful way.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s all-Republican U.S. House delegation sent a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Monday calling for Senate Democrats to vote in support of a funding bill to end the federal government shutdown.
On day 20 of the government shutdown, Senate Democrats remained at odds with Republicans and the Trump administration on passing a short-term measure unless demands are met to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits currently set to expire at the end of the year. If the shutdown does not end Tuesday — at 21 days — it will become the second longest federal shutdown in U.S. history. The longest shutdown lasted 35 days during President Donald Trump’s first term in office.
The House passed a short-term funding bill in September, which has repeatedly failed to advance in the Senate. In the letter to Schumer, Iowa Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra called for Senate Democrats to support the continuing resolution passed by the House to reopen the government.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter said the shutdown is “inflicting real harm on the people of Iowa: women, children, farmers, veterans, seniors, and service members.” According to the legislators, more than 18,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay, 160,000 veterans are not able to receive assistance from regional U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offices, and 62,000 women and children supported through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program face service disruptions in the state because of the shutdown.
The continued shutdown could cause further problems for the 276,000 Iowans on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, as well as 680,000 Medicare beneficiaries who use telehealth services. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services issued a release Friday saying there was a “possibility” SNAP benefits would not be issued onto electronic benefits cards in November, as instructed by the federal Food and Nutrition Service.
The letter urged Schumer and Democrats to “set aside partisanship, put the American people first, and vote to immediately reopen the government.”
Miller-Meeks, who led the letter, said Americans deserve a functioning government, “not a Schumer shutdown.”
“For 20 days, Iowans have paid the price because Senate Democrats refuse to support a clean, bipartisan plan to fund the government,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “We passed a bill that keeps essential services running, pays our troops, protects families, and allows us to finish the appropriations process responsibly. It’s time for the Senate to act and put people over politics.”
Republicans and Democrats have continually sparred over which party is to blame for the shutdown. Earlier in October, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement criticizing Iowa’s House delegation for attending campaign fundraisers and GOP leadership events instead of working to find a solution to ending the shutdown.
“Iowa Republicans have the ability right now to stop health care premiums from more than doubling for tens of thousands of Iowa families,” Hart said in a statement. “Stubbornly, they refuse to  show up to work to end this Trump Shutdown. Instead, they’ve been letting deployed Iowa National Guard troops go without pay while they attend Republican fundraisers and relax on private islands. Iowans deserve more than out-of-touch politicians who don’t do anything about rising health care costs. Voters will remember this next November.”
Feenstra, who has an “exploratory” committee to run for Iowa governor in 2026, characterized Democrats’ demands for ending the shutdown as “giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants and adding $1.5 trillion to our $37-trillion debt” in a statement Monday.
“Their recklessness put pay for our troops and WIC payments at risk, and continues to hurt our farmers, seniors, veterans, and small businesses,” Feenstra said. “I’m glad to join forces with my Iowa colleagues demanding that Senator Schumer and the Democrats end their government shutdown. Again, the Democrats are hurting Iowa families all to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants and put our country deeper into debt.”

A fuller victory might be harder to come by, though.","Signs direct voters to a polling place at Sacred Heart Church in La Plata in this photo from the 2022 elections. (File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge issued a partial ruling Monday in favor of a group of unaffiliated Maryland voters who are challenging the state’s closed primary election system.
A fuller victory might be harder to come by, though.
Judge Pamela K. Alban determined the voters had standing to file their case, but she has yet to decide whether she’ll dismiss the case on other grounds raised by the defendants — or allow it to proceed. She said she will issue a written ruling in the coming days.
Alban indicated she was skeptical of the voters’ arguments in their lawsuit that their claims were not resolved by prior case law, but said she planned to continue considering the “nuance” of the law.
“I want to think about it a bit more,” Alban said. “I imagine no matter what I do, this may not be the end.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs, a group of five Maryland voters who are not affiliated with a political party, were quick to say after Monday’s hearing that they would appeal a dismissal by Alban. But former Maryland Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, one of the attorneys, said he is “hopeful” for a favorable result.
Across the country, primary election structures vary widely. Maryland has a “partially closed” system, because political parties can choose to allow unaffiliated voters to join, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which said Maryland is one of 18 states with either completely closed or partially closed primaries.

The group of voters in the Maryland suit are challenging the fact that the state government funds primary elections that are not open to all voters, since voters must generally affiliate with the Democratic or Republican party to cast their ballots in primaries — unless it’s a non-partisan race. Their suit names the State Board of Elections and various state officials as defendants.
Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general representing the defendants, argued that the case was focused on an alleged “waste of taxpayer money,” and that the plaintiffs didn’t have the standing to sue based on their status as taxpayers.
Eric Gunderson, an attorney for the voters, said that the plaintiffs are not arguing that the state shouldn’t fund primaries. Rather, they are arguing that, if the state continues to sponsor those elections, they should be open to all. The political parties could opt to fund their own primary elections if they wished to continue restricting participation, Gunderson said.
Alban agreed with him, ruling that the case was an elections matter — not a taxpayer one — and that the five plaintiffs had standing to sue because they are all registered voters in the state.
But Kobrin also argued in his filings that previous cases have already decided the issue, and so the Maryland voters’ suit should be dismissed. In particular, he referenced a pair of rulings from the Maryland Supreme Court, from 1946 and 2004, respectively — Hennegan v. Geartner and Suessman v. Lamone.
“Candidly, I think that’s your strongest argument,” the judge told Kobrin, before opening up the floor for him to speak on the legal precedent.
Kobrin asserted that, per prior court rulings, the state’s “well established” reasons for sponsoring primary elections must be weighed against the burden faced by unaffiliated voters, who are fenced out of the process. The state’s needs outweigh the voters’ burden, he said.
If the state didn’t hold primaries, it would run the risk of general election ballots looking more like “NFL pre-season rosters, with hundreds of names,” Kobrin joked. Primaries, he said, “avoid the chaos of a general election with dozens of candidates for each race.”
Kobrin also argued that, although the Maryland Constitution provides the right to vote, it doesn’t necessarily confer upon all Marylanders the right to participate in party primaries.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Of course there’s a right to vote,” Kobrin said. “What they don’t have is the right to participate in partisan races with a party they’re not affiliated with.”
Turning to Gunderson, the judge called the legal precedent his “biggest challenge.”
Gunderson argued that neither of the two main cases cited by Kobrin centered on the issue at the center of their claim: the state’s decision to put its resources toward primary elections.
“If the parties want to have closed primary systems, they should pay for them,” he said.
Because neither of the two state Supreme Court cases deal directly with that issue, Gunderson argued that they shouldn’t bar the plaintiffs from moving forward with their case, and arguing about the precedent in trial.
But Alban prodded back, adding that Gunderson’s “seemed like a really tight reading of those cases.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vote-sign-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 19:01:31.015935

(Photo by Sam Cohen/Capital News Service)By Mary Burke
Over the past few months, invasive spotted lanternflies have emerged in massive numbers across Maryland.
First detected in the United States in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 2014, the Asian native is an invasive pest that feeds on a variety of plants. It is believed that the species was accidentally carried into the United States through an international shipment of stone.
Since they were first seen in Maryland in 2018, spotted lanternflies have spread to 21 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.
What harm do they pose?
Spotted lanternflies are not directly dangerous to humans. Although their flitting around can be irritating, the insects do not sting or bite. There also has not been evidence of spotted lanternflies being poisonous to eat or being dangerous to pets.
However, because they feed on plant sap, spotted lanternflies pose a threat to the well-being of a number of plant species in Maryland. Grapes are particularly at risk of harm: Lanternfly feeding risks killing off grapevines. They also enjoy feeding on maple and willow trees.

 

 

When feeding, lanternflies excrete honeydew, a substance which is known to grow fungus. This “sooty mold” fungus will not directly kill a plant, but in large quantities, may stifle photosynthesis by blocking its access to sunlight. The fungal growth may also prevent crops from being sold.
“They’re seeing damage, almost permanent damage, to things underneath of the trees,” Jessica Boyles, the coordinator for the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s spotted lanternfly response program, told Capital News Service.
Boyles mentioned that she has heard reports of damage to landscaping, siding, and outdoor equipment such as grills and furniture due to honeydew and sooty mold.
Excess honeydew may also pose another threat: Attracting unpopular stinging insects, such as wasps, hornets and honeybees.
Why are they everywhere?
Spotted lanternflies are notorious for hitchhiking to new places on cars and trains.
Because each female typically lays between 30 and 50 eggs, lanternfly populations can explode in just a few years. These egg masses can be hard to spot, closely resembling mud splotches.
Without native natural predators, lanternfly populations can develop under the radar over several years until they emerge in numbers that are impossble to ignore.
“It really wasn’t all of a sudden,” said Michael Raupp, a University of Maryland entomology professor.
“They were really here for several years, but at low levels,” Raupp stated. “Now, because they’ve had time for their populations to increase, we’re seeing them everywhere.”
What can you do?
Stomping them, while satisfying, will do little to curb the insect’s population growth, some experts say.
“The thing that regulates their population are predators, parasites and diseases,” Raupp said. “So, by stepping on some spotted lanternflies, it’s kind of like spitting in the ocean and thinking you’ve turned back the tide.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Maryland’s Agriculture Department instead recommends installing circle traps, which capture spotted lanternflies without using chemicals that may put other insect populations at risk. These traps wrap around trees to funnel spotted lanternflies into a dead-end container, and can be either purchased or made at home. It may also be helpful to dispose of egg masses if you see them.
Spotted lanternflies prefer to feast on the Tree of Heaven plant, another invasive species from Asia. Removing a Tree of Heaven (roots and all) from your yard can help avoid attracting the insect.
Lastly, checking your vehicles before traveling can also help to prevent the spread.
“Make sure that you don’t bring spotted lanternfly with you on your daily commute,” Boyles said.
Ultimately, however, experts predict that spotted lanternfly populations will eventually subside once they begin to face more predation and disease.
“Eventually, Mother Nature will take care of this, as she does with many of our invasive species,” Raupp said.
Some areas have already begun to see population declines due to an increase in predators and disease.
“We now have more than 1,000 observations of indigenous vertebrates and invertebrates eating spotted lanternflies,” Raupp said. Those include spiders, mantises, chickens and pheasants.

This is not to say, however, that stomping lanternflies is futile.
“If you’re killing one … you are making sure that that spotted lanternfly can’t essentially quadruple its numbers,” Boyles said.
As lanternflies continue to lay eggs up until the first frost, often in December, it can still be worth it to squash the pests, experts say.
Why bother reporting?
Currently, the state’s Department of Agriculture is still accepting reports of spotted lanternfly sightings across Maryland.
Although officials acknowledge that total eradication of the species is unlikely, reporting helps the agency to allocate resources to areas experiencing large populations of lanternflies.
“That information is vital,” Boyles said. “It does help us.”

Gov. Larry Rhoden announced that Nick Lamb will serve as the department’s new secretary on Monday afternoon. The governor said in a press release that the 31-year veteran of prison systems in Iowa, New Mexico and Illinois was selected after “an extensive interview process and aggressive national search.”

“We found the right person that will help keep our corrections system strong and safe for both inmates and officers,” Rhoden said. “Nick’s leadership will ensure strong implementation of rehabilitation services that will reduce recidivism and keep our communities safe.”
Lamb is currently the deputy director of institutional operations for the Iowa prison system, overseeing nine facilities, 2,500 employees, and approximately 8,500 inmates. He’s also a retired staff sergeant with the U.S. Army National Guard. He served 21 years.
Rhoden also thanked Kellie Wasko, who resigned in a letter sent over Labor Day weekend that announced Oct. 20 as her departure date.
The three and a half years during which Wasko presided over the state’s prison system were some of the most eventful – and controversial – in recent memory for the department.
Her resignation came at the same time 20 lawmakers asked her to step down, although Rhoden said Wasko made her decision before those lawmakers went public with their demand.
Three weeks later, at a special session of the state legislature, lawmakers voted to back a plan to build a new, $650 million men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls. Lawmakers rejected an $825 million plan to build in southern Lincoln County in February, during the regular legislative session.
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

Wasko had drawn criticism for her handling of the prison project’s controversies over location and funding, and for policy changes she’d instituted during her time in office.
Rhoden said he never lost confidence in Wasko, but also said in September that her departure could help clear a path for a new men’s prison.
Wasko came to South Dakota in 2022 from Colorado, where she’d worked first as a nurse and then an administrator for that state’s corrections department. 
Lamb, her replacement, will begin in mid-November. Brent Fluke, the deputy DOC secretary, will act as interim secretary until then.

In televised remarks made Oct. 10, Hegseth said, “Today we are announcing that we are signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.”
Later that same day, Hegseth posted on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, a clarification writing, “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States – nor anything like a base.”
Records show Idaho Gov. Little, Sen. Risch weren’t aware Qatar facility announcement was coming

Records obtained under the Idaho Public Records Act by the Idaho Capital Sun show that several elected state and federal leaders in Idaho, including Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, who serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Gov. Brad Little were caught completely off guard by Hegseth’s announcement and had no idea it was coming. 
Then on Thursday, Risch, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson and Little, all R-Idaho, wrote a joint letter to Hegseth asking for a briefing on the announcement and answers to several questions. 
“Like many foreign military sale agreements to allies, the plans to sell F-15QAs to Qatar have been in the process for years,” Crapo, Little, Risch and Simpson wrote in the letter. “However, we were given no advance notice that this agreement had been finalized or that it was going to be formally announced. While Qatar, as a long-time U.S. ally, provides substantial support to the U.S. military in the Middle East, such as allowing a U.S. base hosting thousands of U.S.-ready-to-fight-warriors, it is understandable that Qatar’s history of funding Iran-backed terrorist groups like Hamas and the extremism espoused by Qatari-based Al Jazeera has raised concerns among Idahoans.”
 Idaho elected officials raise several questions in letter to Hegseth

The Idaho Republican leaders identified several questions for Hegseth about cost and security concerns, including:

Given the technological capabilities of the Mountain Home AFB range complex, what measures will be implemented to safeguard against any compromise to our national security?
What screening, intelligence, or vetting processes are in place to ensure no trainees have ties to hostile or extremist organizations?
Are there any specific security concerns for the surrounding communities and for U.S. military personnel stationed at Mountain Home AFB?
Is there a long-term plan to convert Mountain Home AFB into a multi-national training facility for foreign allies?
How many Qatari personnel will be involved in the training mission?
How long will they be deployed to Idaho?
Will families be allowed to accompany Qatari personnel, and what restrictions, if any, will be placed on their travel?
Is there a cost to American taxpayers to house, train, and feed the foreign military personnel covered by this agreement?

“In the interest of informing our constituents, maintaining open lines of communication, and fostering closer federal and state collaboration regarding this training squadron, we would like the department to provide more information about the plans and intentions of this mission now that it appears to be finalized,” Crapo, Little, Risch and Simpson wrote to Hegseth. “We request that you provide a briefing to the Idaho Congressional Delegation, as well as for the governor of Idaho and state legislators potentially impacted by the agreement, in Boise on the details of this agreement.”

Idaho’s fourth member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, did not sign the letter to Hegseth, but also requested a briefing on the announcement. In a letter to a group of Idaho legislators who call themselves the Gang of Eight, Fulcher wrote that he also requested a briefing from Hegseth, and that Hegseth’s office promised a response. 
“Since the Oct. 10 announcement by Sec. Hegseth, I have been in touch with various federal sources to learn as much detail as possible,” Fulcher wrote in the letter to Idaho legislators. “In addition, I have reached out directly to (Hegseth), expressing my disappointment with the lack of communication and to request a briefing. The secretary’s office has acknowledged receipt and pledged a response.”
Risch issued a press release announcing the joint letter to Hegseth and released the text of their letter to Hegseth. 
Efforts to reach Little’s office on Monday afternoon were not immediately successful. 
Trump has announced that he is changing the title of the Department of Defense to the Department of War and changing Hegseth’s title to Secretary of War, but the name change requires Congressional approval to become permanent. 
Hegseth worked as a host on Fox News prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as secretary of defense.

The proposed bill, which was circulated for co-sponsorship Monday by Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), Rep. Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), would include warnings about the presence of PFAS — even though the state has been unable to finalize a PFAS limit for groundwater. 
That provision would allow private well owners to be warned about the presence of PFAS despite the yearslong political quicksand that has mired the effort to enact a contaminant limit for the class of chemicals. The lack of a PFAS standard has been a regular sticking point in negotiations over legislation to spend $125 million already set aside for PFAS clean up. 
While the state doesn’t have a PFAS groundwater standard, it does have standards for nearly 150 other chemicals such as aluminum, nitrates and lead. 
About one-third of Wisconsinites get their drinking water from private wells, which don’t come with the same warnings that are often required of municipal water systems. 
“The public should be able to know if there is any threat to the safety of the water they and their children drink every day,” the co-sponsorship memo states. “This bill would provide Wisconsinites with more knowledge so they can protect themselves and their children from pollutants and allow them to take advantage of local and county-level testing initiatives and state-level assistance opportunities like the Well Compensation Grant Program.” 
After the legislation’s announcement, environmental groups celebrated it as a potential win for clean water. 
“Wisconsinites have a right to know about pollution that may be impacting the health of their families,” said Peter Burress, government affairs manager for Wisconsin Conservation Voters. “This legislation is a common sense solution that will protect Wisconsin families. It’s unacceptable that so many Wisconsin families could be drinking water contaminated with PFAS, lead, and nitrates — chemicals tied to cancer and birth defects  — without ever being told.”

The cutting of several executive positions comes as the network’s new president and CEO Steve Leffler aims to create a leaner organization and move more decision making power to the hospitals.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in Burlington on May 31, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
UVM Health announced Monday that it was laying off several top executives at the network level. The change comes as new leadership takes shape with an emphasis on shifting power out of the network and back to its member hospitals. 
The network will phase out the roles of Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief of Staff by the end of the year. Jason Williams, who worked as the Chief External Relations Officer at the network level, also decided to leave his post as part of the transition, according to an email the network’s new CEO, Steve Leffler sent staff Monday afternoon. It is not clear if the network will fill his position or disperse his responsibilities to others in his department. 
University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, and Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, three hospitals in upstate New York and a home health and hospice program comprise the hospital network.

High executive compensation at the network has come under scrutiny in recent years. In 2024, 19 executives at the network received a combined $3 million in end of year bonuses. In a September press release specifically weighing in on the rising cost of healthcare in the state, Governor Phil Scott specifically called out “perverse financial incentives and executive bonuses paid for by skyrocketing premiums.”
The changes come as part of an effort to make the network leaner and more efficient, Leffler, said in his Monday email. He officially began the new role last week, after former president and CEO Sunny Eappen stepped down. Leffler will remain in his role as president of University of Vermont Medical Center while also leading the network.
During its September budget decisions, the Green Mountain Care Board, the state’s main health care regulator, brought extra scrutiny to the hospital network for the high costs of care at its biggest hospital, UVM Medical Center, and its expensive administrative arm. Eappen’s departure was, in part, a reaction to the mounting public pressure, trustees of the hospital and network previously told VTDigger. 
Care board chair Owen Foster told VTDigger that a leaner network is a step in the right direction for the type of change he hopes to see at UVM Health. “Those decisions were definitely in line with some of the criticisms and concerns that the care board has had about excessive layers of management and lack of local control. It sounds to me like they’re making hard decisions,” Foster said. “Certainly for those people [who] are impacted, it’s painful and difficult, but overall it sounds like it’s a necessary course correction, and we appreciate the effort.” 
As part of his new role, Leffler outlined a vision for a less network-centric organization, which he said would vest more decision making power in the hospitals and those closer to the level of care.
Under Eappen, the president of each partner hospital reported to the network’s Chief Operating Officer. Now, they will once again report directly to the network’s CEO. 
In addition to the layoffs, Leffler announced that the chair of each hospital’s board of trustees will have a voting seat at the network board. He added that he will continue working on ways to involve the trustees of the member hospitals more meaningfully, including decisions on hospital budgets. Right now, the network board holds the decision-making power for its member hospitals’ budgets. 
It is likely that the network can expect more changes to follow in time, Leffler said in his email. He promised transparency throughout the process.
“I know change can bring uncertainty, but a few things are clear. We are staying together as a health system. Every health care partner, team and shared service in our health system plays a vital role, and we are stronger because we work as one,” he wrote. “These changes are about better supporting you and the work you do as a care provider, so we can stay focused on what matters most: our patients, our people and our mission.”
Foster, at the care board, added that changes at University of Vermont Medical Center are likely to be a major component of network-wide change. He noted that in the settlement agreement the hospital made with the care board for exceeding its budget last year, the hospital agreed to allocate resources for a structural transition. Foster said he hopes the hospital addresses its long waitlists for primary care and screenings by moving care out of the hospital.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 21:57:13+00:00,CT Mirror,"Lamont names 4 to PURA board, including Thomas Wiehl as chief",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/new-pura-board/,"The appointments, which follow the resignation of former chair Marissa Gillett, will almost completely transform the makeup of PURA.","Gov. Ned Lamont began his rebuild of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority on Monday, appointing four new members to the body and naming its new chief, the consumer advocacy attorney Thomas Wiehl.
Wiehl, of Madison, will replace Marissa Gillett, who resigned from her role as the state’s top utilities regulatory earlier this month. Joining him will be three new commissioners: former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme, energy policy professor Janice Beecher of New Britain and investor Everett Smith of Greenwich.
“These four nominees have an extensive amount of expertise and a diverse set of experience in energy and utilities,” Lamont said in a statement announcing his picks.
“In nominating new commissioners and completing a full board, I implore everyone to remember that it’s the public whose interests should always come first and must be protected,” he continued. “The entire purpose of PURA is centered on the understanding that utility companies all provide an essential public service that everybody depends on, and we must have an independent authority providing careful, rigorous oversight to ensure that these services are safe and reliable and that the consumers paying for them are doing so at just and reasonable rates.” 
The appointments, which Lamont was largely commended on, will almost completely transform the makeup of PURA, which is in charge of reviewing and approving the rates charged by the state’s major investor-owned utilities such as Eversource and Illuminating.
Lamont opted not to re-nominate commissioner Michael Caron, who has served at PURA since 2012. His departure will make Vice Chair David Arconti, who was appointed by Lamont last year, the longest-tenured member of the authority’s board.
Wiehl comes to PURA from the Office of Consumer Counsel, the state agency that advocates on behalf of utility customers during rate cases. He served as the office’s legal and regulatory director.
The other new appointees — with the exception of Cheeseman — also fulfill Lamont’s public desire to find candidates who come from professional backgrounds outside the halls of the State Capitol.
Beecher is a professor emeritus at Michigan State University, where she previously served as director of the school’s Institute of Public Utilities. She is also the editor-in-chief of the trade journal, “Utilities Policy.” Smith is the founder and chief executive of GoldenSet Capital, which has investments in solar, wind, energy storage and natural gas. He previously worked in finance for GE Capital. 
Cheeseman served in the legislature from 2016 to 2024, and was a member of the Energy and Technology Committee.
In selecting his nominees, Lamont said he looked for candidates who could “hit the ground running, with a breadth of experience.” However, a number of controversies swirling around Gillett’s departure also made the recruitment process difficult. Lamont previously told reporters that he’d been turned down by more than one potential hire. 
PURA has operated with only three commissioners for most of Lamont’s time in office, despite lawmakers voting to increase the size of its board to five members in 2019.
The authority’s ranks were further depleted last month when Gillett suddenly stepped down amid mounting criticism over her leadership style and threats of an impeachment inquiry from Republicans in the state legislature. Those threats came after it was revealed by the Hartford Courant that Gillett’s chief of staff had directed the other commissioners to route all requests for information from staff members through her office — a policy that Gillett previously denied existed. Her resignation took effect on Friday, Oct. 10.
Adding to the authority’s myriad challenges are public frustrations over Connecticut’s chronically-high cost of electricity as well as complaints from utility executives who say that the state’s regulatory environment is bad for business. 
When asked about PURA’s relationship with the utility companies on Monday, Wiehl said that it “should be improved” while avoiding any explicit critiques of Gillett’s leadership.
“My focus is on being collaborative, making sure everyone at the commission, from staff all the way up to every commissioner, is part of the conversation,” Wiehl said. 
Wiehl’s appointment drew praise from a spectrum of onlookers that included both utilities as well as consumer advocates.
In a statement, Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said the company was supportive of the governor’s picks, and specifically singled out Wiehl as a “moderating presence” while at OCC.
“With this new commission, there is a genuine opportunity for balance and collaboration among all parties to ensure that the needs of Connecticut residents and businesses are met in the most affordable and transparent way through an open, lawful, and predictable regulatory process,” Ratliff said. “Critical needs exist for state and regional infrastructure investments to maintain a reliable and resilient grid that can accommodate new sources of generation to meet historic levels of electric demand projected in the coming years.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, declined to comment on the picks Monday. 
Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, said he believed Wiehl would likely continue the tough regulatory approach established under Gillett. “It’s clear that [Lamont] has chosen to stand up to the bullying by Eversource and UI,” he said.
Lamont’s office said the picks will also shift the partisan makeup of PURA to an even split between Democrats — Wiehl and Arconti — and Republicans — Cheeseman and Smith. Beecher, a political independent, will round out the group. 
Republicans had been broadly critical of both Gillett’s leadership as well as Lamont’s decision to leave other vacancies at PURA unfilled for years. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said the governor’s appointments on Monday were both welcome and overdue.
“I’m hoping that a new broom sweeps clean and that we will be moving Connecticut in a better direction,” Candelora said. 
Each of the new members will serve in an interim capacity until their appointments are confirmed by lawmakers during the next legislative session. 
Wiehl said that his first day of work will be on Tuesday, and that he will be followed by Cheeseman and Beecher in the coming weeks. 
Smith, who may need more time to consult with state ethics officials and divest from his holdings in the energy industry, is expected to join the other commissioners at a later date, Lamont said. As a result, Caron is expected to stay on for the time being until he can be replaced by Smith.
Caron said Monday that he felt “lucky” to have served at PURA, and offered praise for Lamont’s new crop of commissioners. “I think he’s got a good crew… they’ll having no learning curve to speak of,” he said. 
In the short term, the appointments also solve a thorny question brought about by Gillett’s departure: whether PURA, with just two commissioners, could issue final decisions on rate cases and other pending matters.
Lamont’s office took the cautious view that state law requires PURA to have at least three members in order to reach a quorum, according to spokesman Rob Blanchard. As a result, the governor needed to appoint at least one member right away in order to keep the authority functioning.
PURA’s current docket includes requests to raise rates for customers of both United Illuminating and the Yankee Gas Company, as well as a proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
Wiehl said on Monday that he would recuse from those cases due to close work on them with OCC. However, his joining PURA will give the authority the quorum needed to render a decision.
Late last week, UI offered a proposed settlement to PURA that would increase the company’s annual revenues by $63.7 million. That amount is less than original $105 million increase sought by the company when it filed its rate case last year, and above OCC’s proposal for a $54 million increase.
PURA is currently scheduled to issue a final decision in that case on Oct. 28.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PURA_Lamont-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, said last week he would resign effective noon on Monday after comments he and his wife made in a Young Republicans group chat rife with hateful messages leaked, making national headlines.
However, as of 3 p.m. on Monday, the office of Gov. Phil Scott had not received official notice of the first-term lawmaker’s resignation. And as of Monday late morning, Douglass also remained chair of the Orleans County Republican Committee, the body expected to help identify his replacement.
Gov. Phil Scott has the power to appoint people to vacant legislative seats in a process laid out in state law. Normally, the governor would request a list of recommended replacements from the party committee from the district represented.

The Orleans County Senate district encompasses 20 towns, including Montgomery in Franklin County, and Burke, Newark, Sheffield and Sutton in Caledonia County. Any of the district’s towns with an active GOP caucus can have a say in Douglass’ replacement, according to Chet Greenwood, Orleans County Republican Committee treasurer and a former longtime chair. 
Greenwood said that as of Monday morning, Douglass had not resigned as chair of the county party, adding that he was “not sure what his plans are.”
“It’s going to be hard for him to keep his position,” he added.  
Douglass did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether he intended to remain chair of the county committee. 
Anya Tynio, who previously ran for Vermont’s U.S. House seat as a Republican, currently serves as the Orleans County Republican Committee’s vice chair. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. 
The county committee has not formally begun the process of replacing Douglass, Greenwood said. A meeting requires a warning at least three days ahead of time, and the committee has not yet warned a meeting. He was unsure when the process will begin for compiling potential replacements for Douglass. 
The governor “can take as long as he wants” once he has the list of names, Greenwood said. 
Douglass has faced intense pressure to resign from leaders across the political spectrum in Vermont since a Politico report last Tuesday revealed bigoted remarks Young Republican leaders across the country made, including Douglass and his wife, Brianna Douglass, in a Telegram group chat.
Following Politico’s story, Vermont elected officials across the political spectrum quickly called for Douglass to resign. 
The exposé revealed members of the Young Republicans Telegram chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments. 
It’s unclear who might top the list of recommendations to replace Douglass. In the 2024 Republican primary, he defeated Aime Conrad Bellavance. The seat was previously held by Vermont Senate stalwart Bobby Starr, a moderate Democrat. 
In an early bid for legislative office more than a year in advance, Gaston Bathalon, a Democrat from Troy, announced Monday he’d run for the Orleans County Senate seat Douglass is vacating. The election isn’t until November 2026.
Bathalon, an Army veteran, has served on the Troy Selectboard and local school boards.

An Iowa company that helps state and federal agencies with taxpayer-financed health care improvement programs is being sued for alleged sexual harassment.
Telligen Inc., of West Des Moines, which is under contract with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to help 14 states pursue various health care initiatives, is being sued by Trisha Boughn of Linn County. In part, the lawsuit alleges negligence in the hiring and supervision of Ricardo Berman, the company’s former state health solutions director.
“Berman harassed Trisha and other women on the team by asking them about their personal lives, showing them a semi-nude photo of his neighbor, suggesting they work in the nude, complaining about how American women cry about ‘rape’ and how this is a problem he had experienced personally,” the lawsuit states. “Telligen either failed to notice or simply didn’t care.”
“We are aware of the situation but cannot comment on ongoing or pending litigation,” said Matt Meyer, a Telligen spokesman.

According to the lawsuit, Telligen hired Boughn in October 2018, and she is currently a program specialist for the company, reviewing patient records and making assessments of nursing homes.
In May 2024, according to the lawsuit, Telligen hired Ricardo Berman, giving him supervisory responsibilities over Boughn and seven other female employees, while he worked remotely from Washington, D.C.
Berman, the lawsuit claims, told Boughn he intended to make her a “bad ass” manager to the extent that she wouldn’t recognize herself in six months, after which his conduct “quickly escalated to inappropriate and unwelcome behavior.”
According to the lawsuit, Berman began referring to Boughn and program specialist Amanda Hope as his “angels” and as “Charlie’s Angels.”
Berman, the lawsuit claims, “insisted on holding repeated, unnecessary one-on-one meetings with Trisha, demanded constant reports about who she was speaking to and the substance of those conversations, and incessantly called her during work hours, disrupting her ability to perform her job duties.”
During those conversations, Berman allegedly steered the discussion toward matters unrelated to work and which were “almost always sexual in nature.” At the same time, the lawsuit claims, Berman knew little about the company and showed “consistent indifference towards understanding Telligen’s work.”
At the end of July 2024, Berman set up a meeting for Boughn, Hope and himself to meet in person and discuss their work during a September 2024 weekend get-together in Des Moines.
In the weeks leading up to that meeting, the lawsuit alleges, Berman frequently made unsolicited comments to Boughn about co-workers being interested in him or wanting to date him, and during one work meeting remarked, “You wouldn’t believe the number of people who work naked.”
According to the lawsuit, in August 2024, Berman told Boughn and other team members that he used a telescope to photograph a semi-nude woman who lived in the apartment below him, then proceeded to “enlarge the image and display it on the Teams meeting for all participants” to see, saying, “See, she’s got on her sexy panties. All kinds of people work naked. I get porn for free.”
On a separate Teams call, Berman allegedly remarked, “American women are dangerous. You can have sex with a European woman and nobody thinks anything of it, but you can have sex with an American woman and suddenly it’s rape.”
Lawsuit: Women given vibrators as ‘gifts’
During the September meeting in Des Moines, Berman allegedly invited Boughn and Hope to his hotel for a planned gift exchange. “Once they got to Berman’s room, he proceeded to turn the lights low and put on some music,” the lawsuit claims. Berman then gave Boughn and Hope their gifts, each with a card that read, “Manager meditation tool, earth to moon.”
The lawsuit alleges that “inside each bag was the same ‘gift’ — a large purple vibrator. Trisha and Amanda were visibly shocked and speechless. Berman broke the silence, saying with a big smile, ‘I want my managers to relax.’”
After Hope excused herself to use the restroom, “Berman grabbed Trisha’s head and forced his tongue into her mouth and down her throat,” the lawsuit alleges. “Trisha put her hands up, pulled back from Berman, and said, ‘Too much.’”
After Hope returned, the lawsuit claims, the two women left Berman’s room and Hope informed Boughn that Berman had once tried to kiss her while telling her she “had never been properly kissed.”
Two days later, as Hope and Boughn prepared to leave Des Moines, Berman allegedly requested a 15-minute meeting with them in the hotel lobby at which he angrily announced, “Starting now we are going to keep everything professional,” instructed Boughn and Hope to alert him if he was making them uncomfortable, and then blamed Boughn for ruining the weekend.
The lawsuit alleges that Boughn was distraught in the days that followed, aware that Berman was in prearranged meetings with the human resources staff and Telligen executives.
Hope, the lawsuit claims, shared with Boughn “inappropriate, flirtatious texts” she had received in the past from Dan Shipley, Telligen’s senior human resources business partner, which the lawsuit says undermined Boughn’s faith in human resources and its ability to properly handle any complaint she might file regarding Berman.
The lawsuit also claims Shipley once told Boughn about a time he and the female human resources director at Telligen had gone out drinking and the director got “very drunk” and was driving somewhere when he made her “stop the vehicle so he could urinate in the street.”
On Sept. 13, 2024, according to the lawsuit, Boughn reported Berman’s alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault to Telligen and, with the encouragement of human resources, she filed a police report on the incident. Days later, Telligen’s vice president, Neal Cohen, allegedly called Boughn to apologize for what happened on his watch. Berman was subsequently terminated, the lawsuit claims.
“Telligen then demoted Trisha,” the lawsuit alleges. “They (also) told Trisha the promotion Berman gave her was never approved, so she was not really a manager … Telligen promptly disinvited Trisha and Amanda from manager meetings to which they were previously invited.”
The lawsuit claims that when Boughn asked Telligen executives about the process used to hire Berman, they responded in a manner that indicated they “did not know much about Berman, despite hiring him for such an important position.”
The lawsuit alleges that Berman has a “known history of sexual harassment,” and that if Telligen had performed a background check or spoken to his previous employers, it “could have discovered he had multiple sexual harassment complaints filed against him at prior jobs and posed a threat to Telligen’s female employees.”
Berman, the lawsuit claims, “was wholly unqualified for a director position at Telligen” and had “virtually no understanding of how to do his job … He was unfamiliar with the nature of Telligen’s work and required significant time and explanation from staff to understand the organization’s activities.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligent hiring, negligent supervision, retaliation, and fostering a hostile work environment that led to sexual harassment.
Telligen has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Telligen is a for-profit company that was first created in 1972 as the non-profit Iowa Foundation for Medical Care. For years, the foundation was the federally designated quality improvement organization tasked with improving health care outcomes in Iowa and other states.
Between 2011 and 2013, the foundation merged with other entities and became Telligen, an employee-owned company that continues to work with state and federal governments on health care improvement.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LEXINGTON — Natasha DeJarnett, a University of Louisville assistant professor of medicine, said her speciality is air quality and heart disease, though in recent months she’s been talking much more with community members about another topic: a possible influx of data centers.
A wide range of questions and concerns have come up: What data centers could mean for utility and electricity costs; where data centers will be placed; how nearby property values could be impacted; and how data centers will impact public health?
DeJarnett,  speaking Monday afternoon at a conference hosted by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, remembered talking with someone from Dulles, Virginia, an area that’s become one of the nation’s biggest hubs for massive, electricity-intensive “hyperscale” data centers. 
“What she said was, ‘You don’t want a data center in your backyard.’ And I think that’s been a common conversation that we’ve heard in these community meetings,” DeJarnett said. “People are deeply concerned about their families and their children and the future of their children.” 
DeJarnett, other University of Louisville researchers and an attorney with the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council told the audience of state officials and industry stakeholders the answers to questions about data centers’ impacts remain to be seen. 
But the potential considerations, both positive and negative, of what these large-scale operations could bring to Kentucky communities are numerous. 
“Hyperscale” data centers are essentially massive computer warehouses that support a range of online services from artificial intelligence to credit card processing. These data centers also tend to use a tremendous amount of electricity to power the computers and water to cool them. A number of data center developers are eyeing Kentucky, particularly after state lawmakers enhanced tax incentives for such operations. 
Based on conversations she’s had in Jefferson County, Oldham County and outside of Kentucky, DeJarnett said one of the primary considerations is the location of a data center. She pointed to research by the California-based Kapor Foundation that found data center locations in that state tend to be in places that already have heavier pollution, including minority communities that stand to be disproportionately affected by data centers.

Byron Gary, the Kentucky Resources Council attorney on the panel, pointed to a proposed data center along Camp Ground Road in western Jefferson County in a “predominantly black, predominantly low-income neighborhood” in an area “already overburdened with industry.” 
Yet another consideration discussed by the panel: the cost of electricity infrastructure, both generating power and transmitting it, to serve data centers and how much average ratepayers should bear. 
Ted Smith, the panel’s moderator and director of the University of Louisville’s Center for Health Air, Water and Soil, referenced reporting from the Wall Street Journal that compared the scale of data center construction to the boom and bust of railroad expansion in the 19th century. When railroad companies went bankrupt, it left the excess railroad tracks stranded.  
“If you over build the power infrastructure, and it’s railroads — you then you have a problem, right?” Smith said.
He said the costs to build excess power infrastructure to support data centers could hypothetically be passed to ratepayers if there’s a downturn.
In one instance, Kentucky’s utility regulator is considering a request from Kentucky’s largest utility to build billions of dollars in new gas-fired power generation to support prospective data centers.  
Gary, the attorney, said such large data centers do create some jobs, and some communities “are desperately in need of more funding for schools” in the form of property taxes. But the benefits and drawbacks of such a large project, he said, need to be debated in public. 
He said that public debate isn’t necessarily an opportunity for a community to “shout” down a data center project but instead an opportunity to ask questions about how it could best serve a community. 
“Transparency has to be a part of it.” Gary said. “They have a say in, ‘Is this the best place for it? What benefit are we going to get as a community?’”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2400-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Workers from firm Wicker Construction are repairing one of the “major” leaks on Monday, a press release from the city said. 
“For years, efforts to identify and repair these leaks have not been dealt with in a swift and aggressive manner, for whatever reason,” said Steve Hutton, Jackson’s recreation manager. “That stops now.”
Hutton referenced “million-dollar plus” water bills incurred by leaks at the zoo over the years. During a recent status conference with U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, third-party utility JXN Water said the city owed over $6 million in unpaid water bills, and that the largest amount came from the Jackson Zoo.
It’s unclear how many leaks are at the zoo, which is located in west Jackson. In 2015, the release said, the city noticed that the moat surrounding the zoo’s chimpanzees, a buffer between visitors and the animals, was losing water. The city then used a fire hydrant to keep the moat full, WLBT reported.
Yet, after officials relocated the chimpanzees and turned the hydrant off, the moat remained full, revealing a “major water line leak” that ran all day, every day. The leak existed “for years,” the release said.
“It seems like when we identify one problem, it results in another problem being discovered,” said Peter Teeuwissen, Jackson’s chief administrative officer. “The voters made it clear they were hiring us to fix difficult problems. We absolutely will get these problems fixed.”
Wicker Construction will focus on fixing the major leak Monday, and then will address leaks within the moat and smaller ones around the zoo, the city said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/06080617/DJI_0792-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

It has not been previously reported.Joining Scott, of Virginia, were Reps. Frederica Wilson of Florida, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, Mark Takano and Mark DeSaulnier of California, Lucy McBath of Georgia, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona.  Dems reject Trump hand in curriculumThe Democrats said the agency’s proposal would insert President Donald Trump’s administration’s “preferences of a particular understanding of American history in curriculum, professional development, and educational programs.” Civics is a branch of social studies that focuses on rights and obligations of citizenship. Though it’s long enjoyed bipartisan support, the subject has found itself engulfed in the education culture wars regarding how and what is taught as America reckons with its complicated history. The department announced last month it would be prioritizing “patriotic education” when it comes to discretionary grants.  The department’s proposed definition of “patriotic education” calls for a presentation of America’s history that is grounded in an “accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of the American founding and foundational principles” and “the concept that commitment to America's aspirations is beneficial and justified.” But the Democrats found this definition to be “concerning,” saying this framing “creates the potential for schools that teach accurate and complex histories of slavery, Indigenous displacement, the Women’s Suffrage Movement, and the Civil Rights Movement to be limited in their ability to access certain discretionary grants.” Coalition to promote patriotismThe department’s September announcement came the same day it unveiled a civics education coalition that includes a slew of prominent conservative advocacy organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA. Left out of that initiative are some of the more traditional civics and education groups. Instead, many of the coalition’s groups have promoted Trump’s political agenda and promote a vision of U.S. identity that downplays historical wrongs associated with race and gender and projects the country as an exceptional force for good.“Some of these groups have expressed contempt for the teaching of history that does not align with the version of history they believe students should learn, and these same groups would prefer to limit children’s access to materials that depict the realities of slavery in America or the Civil Rights Movement,” the Democrats wrote. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Community members said they’re glad to have more time to find alternative arrangements in a sparse child care landscape, but some still question the company’s management of the facility.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Mount Snow will postpone a plan to reduce its child care offerings to the local community, a spokesperson for the resort’s operator said in a statement Monday. The planned cuts, which were originally slated to take effect in November, will instead move ahead next summer.
The West Dover ski area announced earlier this month that its child care center would transition to an “employee-first” model after years of operating at a financial loss. The cuts would have affected 16 families and an undetermined number of staff, according to a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, the company that has owned and operated Mount Snow since 2019.

Parents and former employees have suggested that a higher number of families could be impacted, and that roughly a dozen staff will be laid off.
On Saturday, affected families and local child care providers met with resort leadership and officials to share concerns and work toward a solution.
“After thoughtful and engaging conversations with the community and coming to further understand their concerns, the team at Mount Snow has decided to extend our community childcare for the 16 impacted families until June 19, 2026, in hopes of better supporting their transition to alternative childcare solutions,” said Samara Sausville, a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, in an email Monday.
Elly Dagg, an affected parent, said she was grateful that Mount Snow responded to public pushback around the decision to limit community child care offerings on short notice. Resort managers called parents individually last Friday to deliver the news that families would have seven additional months to make arrangements before child care changes would be implemented, Dagg said. 
The additional time to plan for switching child care providers is particularly important to a single parent with one income, she said.  
“I’m glad we have this extra time,” Dagg said. “It now gives us a chance to figure out new care.”
The circumstances prompting Mount Snow’s transition, which will proceed as planned in June 2026, remain contested by employees and community members. 
The postponement comes after a recent petition calling on the resort to reverse its decision garnered over 250 signatures, according to Amber Good, an impacted parent who organized the petition.
Good said she is grateful that Mount Snow gave families more time to plan for the changes on the horizon, but that the decision still abdicates the “social responsibility” of maintaining community child care offerings.
Jenn Wood, a former lead teacher at the facility, resigned last week after the cuts were announced. The center’s operational deficit was known among staff members for months but was exacerbated by mismanagement and overstaffing, Woods said. 
The 12 staff members affected by the coming layoffs may leave before June due to the uncertainty of their employment, and two other staff members besides Wood have resigned since the announcement, she said. 
Sausville referred in an email to state guidelines around child care staffing, and said the center works “according to these mandates.” “Our goal is to retain as many team members as possible and explore opportunities for any impacted employees to apply for other roles at the resort,” she added.
Wood said she is helping one impacted teacher open their own child care center in order to ensure secure employment and offer alternative child care options for families. 
Andrea Sumner, director at Kids in the Country child care center, said last week that her local operation may expand if she’s able to hire enough staff.
Mount Snow’s announcement only postpones the inevitable challenge of finding child care in the rural Deerfield Valley, Good said. Parents are working with child care advocates and local representatives to find grants and other resources to fill the looming gap. 
“There is no alternative child care … The only thing we can do is create more child care,” Good said. “Eight months is a much more reasonable timeframe than just six weeks, but we still have a lot of work ahead. Parents are stepping up to tackle the childcare shortage that we expect in the valley next summer.”
Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, helped facilitate Saturday’s meeting. She and Good said some parents were also interested in adopting a co-op model of child care, with help from local providers, to replace the lost slots at Mount Snow.
“Having until June definitely creates more opportunities and possibilities than November,” Sibilia said.

The governor seeks a study first.,"New Jersey lawmakers have sought ways to limit data centers' impact on electricity rates. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy conditionally vetoed legislation Monday that would require data centers to report their water and electricity use, asking lawmakers to add provisions directing state regulators to weigh whether those data centers’ power and cooling demands are unduly burdening other ratepayers.
The redrafted bill would require the Board of Public Utilities to study whether New Jersey ratepayers unreasonably subsidize data centers, examine whether they are funding infrastructure that solely or mostly serves data centers, and estimate how much of New Jerseyans’ utility bills are attributable to data centers’ demands.
“These changes are designed to streamline related efforts to evaluate the impacts of data centers on State and regional resources, and to create an initial assessment after which future reporting requirements may be considered based upon the information gathered,” Murphy said in his veto statement.
Data center developers should pay more for their energy demands

Portions of the original bill requiring data centers to report their water and electricity use to regulators would remain intact if lawmakers agree with Murphy’s veto, though such reporting would be much delayed compared to the bill legislators approved in late June.
As originally drafted, data center operators would have been required to report their utility use within six months of the bill’s signing. The governor’s conditional veto would extend that timeline, requiring those reports be filed by January 2027.
Bill sponsor Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) questioned the proposed delay, noting that data center operators already collected some information about their own utility use and could readily comply with the bill’s disclosure requirements.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“Delaying action by folding this into a two-year study — while keeping critical data hidden from the public — undermines transparency and weakens our ability to respond effectively,” said Ruiz, the senate’s majority leader. “By the time the BPU completes its report, irreversible impacts may already be in place. New Jersey must lead with foresight, not complacency.”
It’s not clear whether legislators will concur with Murphy’s conditional veto. They have that opportunity in the lame-duck session following this year’s gubernatorial and Assembly elections. Ruiz signaled it could be an issue solved under the governor who takes office in January. Murphy, a Democrat, is barred from seeking a third term in November.
“While we may have lost the opportunity to be a national leader in this space, this issue will remain a top policy priority of mine in the 2026 legislative session,” she said. “We will not let critical oversight fall by the wayside while the industry continues to expand.”
Assembly Republicans opposed the original bill, but it won bipartisan support in the Senate.
The governor’s conditional veto directs the Board of Public Utilities to identify and weigh policies to defray data centers’ impact on rates and to gauge the economic benefits such centers bring to New Jersey. And it asks the board to determine whether data centers should be required to benchmark their energy and water use using a federal portal, mirroring an existing requirement for certain buildings of at least 25,000 square feet.
Murphy also seeks to bar the release of information about data centers’ utility use under public records laws, except for anonymized information disclosed in the report on data centers’ utility use.
Mammoth power demands have turned artificial intelligence data centers into a major focal point of policy and political campaigning in the Garden State.
New Jerseyans’ electricity rates rose roughly 20% at the start of June as a result of price-setting capacity auctions that soared to new highs on the promise of data centers’ electricity needs. Power prices are expected to rise again next June.
Murphy has pursued AI as a source of economic growth for New Jersey. He has launched an AI task force within the state’s innovation office, extended tax credits to AI firms and startups, and sought to integrate its use into parts of the public workforce.
“Generative artificial intelligence is a fast-developing industry, and while that development brings exciting possibilities to our State, we must always take seriously our responsibility to manage our resources to support a sustainable and affordable future,” the governor said in his veto statement.

(Getty Images)Six months after 12 families, including Kentuckians, sued the federal government over library book removals at Fort Campbell and other Department of Defense schools, a federal judge ruled Monday that the books must be restored. 
U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in the Eastern District of Virginia also ruled that the defendants — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Beth Schiavano-Narvaez, director of Department of Defense Activity (DoDEA) — cannot further remove books in efforts to implement Pres. Donald Trump’s executive orders related to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
The ruling is limited to the five schools attended by plaintiffs, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which joined in the lawsuit on behalf of the families. The Lantern has asked DoDEA for comment on the ruling. 
Giles, appointed by President Joe Biden, found that school libraries are not exempt from First Amendment protections and furthermore “lack the quintessential elements of government speech.” 
“Defendants attempt to circumvent the First Amendment entirely by asserting that the removal of books from DoDEA libraries constitutes government speech,” Giles wrote. “Defendants contend that as DoDEA’s speech, library curation is exempt from the First Amendment. The Court is unpersuaded.”

It’s “doubtful” that either the public or students “perceives the books in school libraries as conveying a government message,” Giles wrote. 
The government speech doctrine, established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990s, allows the government, through its own speech, to discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint on the theory that the First Amendment does not apply when the government speaks, according to Middle Tennessee State University’s Free Speech Center.
‘Censorship, plain and simple.’ 
The ACLU of Kentucky said the removed items included reading on slavery, Native American history, women’s history, LGBTQ issues and history, preventing sexual harassment and abuse and parts of the Advanced Placement (AP) psychology curriculum. 
“Libraries are intended to provide a breadth of information to students, and like with government speech, it strains credulity that the curation of a library collection would bear the school’s imprimatur,” Giles wrote in her opinion. 
Kentucky students were part of the April federal lawsuit challenging U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
One of the plaintiffs, a Kentucky mother, said at the time that she wanted her children to have access to a wide range of books so they could better understand the world and other people. 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said that the book removals were “censorship, plain and simple.” 
Giles pointed to federal politics, citing Trump, who told Congress on March 6 “we’re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military.”
“The record is clear that by removing books, Defendants intended to deny Plaintiffs access to ideas that they, by virtue of the Presidential EOs, found distasteful, ‘radical’ or ‘divisive,’” and not by the educational qualities of the books, Giles wrote. 
The ACLU’s Shapiro said in a statement: “The materials removed are clearly age-appropriate and are only offensive to those who are afraid of a free-thinking population.”

Mark Gordon, New Mexico cabinet secretaries, corporate executives and others—noted that no contracts are inked for infrastructure or commerce, saying those are still a long way away. 
But they said consensus is growing that the Rocky Mountains region has all the natural gas it needs to meet America’s growing energy needs, as well as Asia’s. And the ambassador said Japan is a willing customer, particularly after the country agreed to spend $7 billion a year to purchase energy from the United States as part of tariff negotiations.

Importing natural gas from Rocky Mountain states “is one of the options we will have on the table,” Yamada said Monday, as the country looks to meet the terms of that agreement.  
The governor touted the “roadmap” and the dignitary’s visit Monday as just the latest example of how New Mexico can find a market for its energy resources in a way that benefits New Mexicans while also transitioning away from carbon-heavy and volatile revenue sources like oil and gas.
“This collective,” she said, referring to those around the table, “is a representation of those commitments to New Mexicans, to the people living in Wyoming, the people living in Japan, the people all across the globe. These are jobs and real opportunities while we’re solving real challenges.”
She also said the framework all parties described Monday is the result of an April visit she and other top state officials made to Japan and Singapore. Her office described the trip at the time as a way to strengthen business ties, promote the state’s energy and computing technologies and explore natural gas export opportunities. 
“This is the fruits of our trip,” she said, thanking the ambassador for “helping us navigate opportunities between our two countries and by highlighting and learning more about what the Western states have to offer.”
Gordon, a Republican, said Wyoming and New Mexico share a common interest in entering Asian energy markets, regardless of partisan differences on clean energy.
“I hate to say ‘bipartisan,’” he said. “This is just good business.”
Jason Sandel, the initiative’s chairman, said Asia’s demand for liquefied natural gas will double by 2025, and the Western state has identified enough resources to reduce the continent’s carbon footprint, on average, by 40%. 
The report identifies two main routes—the Pacific Northwest Pathway and the Southwest Pathway—to efficiently move an increased amount of gas to markets in the Southwest and elsewhere on the West Coast, as well as to Mexico or Washington state, where it can be shipped overseas without needing to go through the Panama Canal or risk bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The San Juan Basin in the Four Corners area is one of seven basins in the region that Lujan Grisham touted as a source for the natural gas. The region includes parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
According to the report, gas from the Rocky Mountain basins is currently more expensive on the national and global markets due to production costs, noting that making the market here more cost-effective would require “new large-scale infrastructure” that navigates “through a difficult geography with mountainous terrain that has previously presented challenges to construction.”
But the benefits could be immense, the report claims, and offer less-carbon intensive energy for data centers, for example, in the West as well as Japan and the rest of Asia energy as those countries seek to handle growing demand while also reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1240-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the department’s Fish and Wildlife Commission are named defendants in two lawsuits arguing, from opposite sides, that the latest wolf hunting regulations violate the state constitution. 
First, a pair of Republican lawmakers and the Outdoor Heritage Coalition filed a lawsuit in Sanders County District Court alleging that the Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets department policies and regulations, had not complied with state laws intended to reduce the state’s population of gray wolves when it adopted regulations for the upcoming hunting and trapping season. 
Then, four conservation organizations filed a lawsuit against the department and commission also in hopes of overturning the latest wolf management regulations, but with an opposing argument — that the decision to increase the quota of wolves that can be killed this year threatens the species and flies in the face of the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. 
The opposing lawsuits, filed Sept. 30 and Oct. 16, are continuing a series of arguments that played out during the 2025 legislative session, which pitted legislators and advocates for reducing the state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves against those seeking to preserve and protect the species. 
At the heart of the suits are the 2025 wolf hunting and trapping regulations, in which the Commission set a statewide harvest quota of 452 wolves, two additional three-wolf quotas for hunting areas outside Yellowstone National Park, plus an additional 100 wolves approved for removal by the department for cases of conflict with livestock or humans. 
Hunters and trappers killed 297 wolves last season, while the most killed in a season was 326 during 2020. The quota for wolf harvest has not been met by hunters and trappers in recent years. 
According to FWP’s latest population survey, there are an estimated 1,091 wolves in Montana, 12 fewer than the 2023 population estimate and slightly lower than the 10-year average of 1,138 wolves. 
But that marginal decline has not been enough for Republican lawmakers who believe the animal has outgrown a stated recovery goal of 15 breeding pairs for the state and in 2021, passed a bill requiring FWP to reduce the number of wolves to a “sustainable level,” with a stated goal of preventing a decline in the state’s deer and elk populations and minimizing livestock predation.
During the 2025 Legislature, lawmakers considered a slew of bills aimed at more dramatically reducing the wolf population, including one by Rep. Shannon Manness, a plaintiff in one lawsuit, by as much as half, aiming towards a population of 450 animals, cited in federal delisting documents as a stable minimum population.
While Manness’ bill did not become law, Rep. Paul Fielder, a Republican from Thompson Falls, did carry one wolf hunting bill that became law, expanding the use of night scopes on private land. 
The two lawmakers in their complaint allege that the Commission has continually adopted more stringent hunting regulations than they could have, and, over the years, have not reduced the wolf population “in a meaningful way.”
“These actions by the Commission demonstrate that it is not establishing rules with the intent to reduce the statewide population,” the complaint states. “… By maintaining wolf populations at higher than mandated levels through inadequate harvest quotas, the Commission has allowed wolves to deplete ungulate populations, thereby diminishing hunting opportunities.”
Rep. Fielder, who at the meeting where the Commission adopted the new regulations said “it is a step in the right direction,” did not respond to an email asking to speak about the lawsuit.
Both the inability to hunt wolves, and lower numbers of game animals due to wolves’ own hunting, allegedly violates a constitutionally guaranteed right to harvest wild fish and wild game, according to the suit.
But the other lawsuit claims overhunting wolves violates a different provision of the Montana Constitution, which preserves the right to a clean and healthful environment.
“Killing of more than half of Montana’s gray wolf population in a single year … will substantially degrade a natural resource and the Montana environment and threatens total population collapse,” the lawsuit brought by WildEarth Guardians, Project Coyote, Footloose Montana and the Gallatin Wildlife Association states. 
The conservation groups argue the harvest level set by the Fish and Wildlife Commission is higher than the department recommends for keeping the population stable, and in fact could lead to the statewide wolf population dropping below the number needed to prevent the species from ending up on the Endangered Species List again. 
Citing the 2024 FWP Wolf Report, the groups say data “shows that a hunting and trapping quota of 458 together with 100 removals greatly exceeds the mortality rates associated with stable populations and is likely to cause a severe decline in overall populations.”
According to FWP’s report, an average harvest of from 308 to 334 wolves has “potential for the population to drop too low to support 15 breeding pairs (450) wolves within a three-year period,” but adds that it is likely the population will remain above that threshold. However, at more than 350 wolves killed annually, “the population will most likely fall below 450 wolves within five years.”
There is also an argument that the state’s method for estimating wolf populations, known as IPOM (Integrated Patch Occupancy Model), is not as accurate as presented, and might overestimate the number of animals in the state. 
That same argument was key in a recent judge’s order to overturn a decision by the federal government to deny endangered species protections for wolves. The judge cited criticisms of IPOM as a reason it should not be considered the “best available science” in setting wolf management policy. 
The conservation groups are seeking a temporary restraining order against the new harvest quota and ultimately are asking the courts to invalidate the new regulations and preserve the status quo. 
“While this may inconvenience some individuals and outfitters, the preservation of a healthy and genetically connected wolf population ensures that the long-term interest in wolf hunting and trapping will be preserved,” the court documents state. “… To knowingly risk erasing wolves now would not only waste this massive investment, but rob Montana citizens and future generations of their rightful natural heritage.”
The lawsuit from the state lawmakers is seeking a court order requiring the Commission to use “all available management tools” to reduce wolf numbers and follow “legislative intent.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011
,DC,2025-10-20 21:18:44+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump tried to lay off more than 2,000 Interior staff in shutdown plan now on hold",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-tried-lay-more-2000-interior-staff-shutdown-plan-now-hold,,"WASHINGTON — The Interior Department announced Monday it will pause efforts to lay off 2,050 employees throughout the country, after a federal judge expanded a temporary restraining order late last week.The new filing provides more information about how the Trump administration plans to reduce the size and scope of a department that oversees much of the country’s public lands. Rachel Borra, chief human capital officer at Interior, wrote in a 35-page document the layoffs would affect employees at the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey, among others. The National Park Service layoffs would target several areas of the country, including 63 of 224 workers at the Northeast regional office, 69 of 223 at the Southeast regional office and 57 of 198 at the Pacific West regional office. The Northeast region holds 83 sites throughout Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.The Southeast region “has 73 parks across 4 million acres in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”The Pacific West region encompasses more than “60 national park sites across California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, parts of Arizona and Montana, and the territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.”The layoffs cannot take place under the temporary restraining order that U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston clarified and expanded Friday during an emergency hearing. The layoffs would be further blocked if Illston, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, issues a preliminary injunction during a hearing scheduled for later this month. Advocates and current and former Interior staff members have told States Newsroom that bare-bones staffing during the government shutdown across the department and the U.S. Forest Service already is leaving America’s treasured natural assets vulnerable to lasting damage.Hundreds proposed for layoffs at Commerce, HHSThe other briefs filed Monday were from the departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services, which said in earlier court documents officials planned to lay off hundreds of federal workers. Commerce’s latest numbers say it would like to lay off 102 workers, while the Health and Human Services Department told the judge officials plan to get rid of 954 people. Both confirmed those efforts are on hold under the temporary restraining order. The numbers were different from those included in earlier filings to the court in the lawsuit, which was brought by labor unions representing federal workers. Those declarations in the earlier filings detailed the below layoff plans:Commerce: Approximately 600 employeesEducation: Remained at 466 employeesHealth and Human Services: 982 employeesHousing and Urban Development: 442 employeesHomeland Security: 54 employeesTreasury: 1,377 employeesFederal attorneys wrote in Monday’s court documents that all other departments “have determined, to the best of their knowledge and based on their investigation to date, that they have no additional information to provide in response to the Court’s October 17, 2025, modified TRO, that was not already provided in their October 17, 2025, declarations.”Energy Department layoffs protested by DemsThe Energy Department wrote in a filing that it didn’t need to declare any planned layoffs to the court since the Reduction in Force notices it had issued didn’t have an effective date. An earlier court filing said the department sent those notices to 179 employees.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House Energy-Water Appropriations subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, wrote in a letter that the Energy Department’s planned layoffs were “a clear act of political retribution that will hurt communities across the country.”“These actions, which reportedly affect 179 employees, appear to be part of a broader effort to implement the administration’s budget request without congressional approval—circumventing the appropriations process and undermining congressional intent,” Murray and Kaptur wrote. “The Department’s actions will raise energy prices for American families by disrupting the implementation of key programs that increase supply and reduce costs for hard-working Americans.”The layoffs are one of the many ways the Trump administration is approaching the government shutdown differently than it did during the last prolonged funding lapse, which took place from December 2018 through January 2019. White House officials have canceled funding approved by Congress for projects in regions of the country that tend to vote for Democrats. And signaled they may not provide back pay for federal workers placed on furlough, which is authorized by a 2019 law that President Donald Trump signed during his first term.Johnson ties shutdown to No Kings ralliesSpeaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said during a morning press conference he hopes Senate Democrats vote to advance a stopgap spending bill soon, allowing the government to reopen. The conclusion of the No Kings protests, he said, could help reduce pressure on Democrats to keep the government shut down. “Now that Chuck Schumer has had his spectacle, he's had his big protest against America, this is our plea: We're asking, and I think everybody in this room and everybody watching, listening to our voices this morning should be hoping that he is finally now ready to go to work and end this shutdown and stop inflicting pain on the American people,” Johnson said. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters outside the White House he believes moderate Democrats, specifically Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, are ready to end the shutdown.Shaheen told the New Hampshire Bulletin on Friday that no official negotiations to end the shutdown are happening. She also criticized the administration's multibillion dollar bailout for Argentina that Trump finalized last week as federal agencies remain dark during the funding lapse and as health insurance premiums are set to increase.But Hassett repeated the argument that Republicans won't negotiate until Senate Democrats vote to reopen the government. He told CNBC Monday morning he believes that will happen ""sometime this week.""""If they want to have policy disputes, they could do it through regular order, but just shutting down the government and making 750,000 government workers not get their paychecks, it’s just not acceptable,"" the White House economic adviser said.Ashley Murray and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

The Senate on Monday adopted an order scheduling a March 3, 2026 special election to fill the First Middlesex seat, held since 2018 by the late Sen. Ed Kennedy, who died on Oct. 1 at the age of 74.
The district, which sits along the border of New Hampshire, includes the city of Lowell and the towns of Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsborough.
The special election primary will be held Feb. 3, 2026, according to Secretary of State William Galvin’s office.
A former Lowell City Council member, Kennedy was serving as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets and Senate vice chair of the Joint Committee on Higher Education.
Lowell Democrat Rep. Rodney Elliott announced on Friday that he is running for the historically Democrat-controlled Senate seat.
“I’m running for State Senate to be the strong voice that for working families, small businesses, and the future we all want to build — one that is more affordable, more inclusive, and more sustainable,” he said in a press release. Elliott served on the Lowell City Council for 24 years, and as the city’s mayor from 2014 to 2016.
Rep. Vanna Howard of Lowell is considering a Senate run.
“Over the last few days, many friends, supporters, and colleagues have reached out encouraging me to run for State Senate,” she said in a statement to the News Service. “Senator Kennedy served Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell, and Tyngsborough with dedication and heart, and whoever follows him has big shoes to fill. I’ll be taking some time with my family in the days ahead to consider this important decision.”
Special election candidates must submit nomination signatures with local election officials by December 23, 2025, according to Galvin’s office. At least 300 certified signatures must be filed with the state elections division by December 30, 2025.
After putting the Boston Elections Department into receivership following the 2024 election cycle, Galvin last Thursday issued an order to local election officials in Lawrence that his office will have staff present in the city to supervise the absentee ballot process and voting during early voting and on Election Day. The order states that “urgent circumstances exist” relating to the absentee ballot application and ballot activities in Lawrence.
His office “has received numerous complaints in connection the absentee ballot application and voting process,” according to Galvin’s order. The issues revolve around supporters of some candidates in the race attempting to submit absentee ballot applications on behalf of voters, according to Boston Globe reporting. 
The Lawrence Election Office has received absentee ballot applications and ballots from people other than the voters ballots were meant for, and some voters submitting an absentee ballot application “do not meet the lawful requirements to cast an absentee ballot,” the order states.
Galvin told the Globe that the situation involved at least 100 applications.
His office is ordering Lawrence election officials to verify authenticity of all absentee ballots submitted; obtain the verified name of individuals submitting absentee ballots on behalf of another voter; and keep records of submitted applications that are incomplete.
Asked why Lawrence’s election’s division isn’t being handled in the same way the Boston Elections Division was, Spokesperson Deb O’Malley told the News Service that the issues occurring in Lawrence are not related to the administration of the election, but more to campaign conduct.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09-13_Galvin_2.jpg?fit=1000%2C700&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s cannabis regulators could begin awarding new retail licenses to prospective business owners eager to join the state’s budding market as early as May 2026.
That’s according to a timeline the Cannabis Control Commission voted 2-1 to adopt on Monday. The timeline sets the pace for officials’ to review applications for the state’s 24 available retail licenses after the application deadline on Dec. 29, 2025.
“It’s clear to me that we need to do a better job forecasting what the next months look like after the application portal closes at the end of this calendar year,” Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern said. “We have never shared what 2026 held.”
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the state’s Cannabis Office will have 90 days to review applications and verify that each meets eligibility qualifications before being placed in a lottery. The timeline builds in at least 60 days to allow applicants to secure approvals at the local level in order to qualify for random selection, Ahern said.
Ahern said the intention is to begin the lottery selection process in the second quarter of 2026, likely in May. 
“I want to add that we reserve the right to delay this process depending on several external factors outside our control,” Ahern said. “For example, if we receive thousands of applications, it will be hard for us to do that.”
As of Monday, no retail applications have been submitted to the state’s cannabis office, spokesperson Charon Rose told Rhode Island Current after the meeting.

Objections on getting ducks in a row
Commissioner Robert Jacquard, the lone vote against regulators’ review timeline, argued that allowing businesses to secure local zoning approvals after the application deadline is unfair to those who met the requirements on time.
“If an applicant is better prepared, better financed, got an earlier start, I think that’s important,” he said. “We have had our regulations out for a good amount of time, people were well-warned that there would not be any extensions beyond the deadlines that were set.”
Those same feelings were shared by many of the members of Rhode Island’s cannabis industry who attended the meeting within the Public Utilities Commission’s office building in Warwick.
“Many of us have invested significant time and money securing compliant locations, paying for rent, purchasing properties, and obtaining special use and zoning permits,” Karen Ballou, owner of CultivatingRI, told commissioners. “I recognize some municipalities have made it difficult for applications to meet certain requirements, but that should not penalize those who have successfully navigated the process.”
Business owners awarded medical cannabis licenses have faced setbacks opening in Woonsocket and Foster amid disputes with local officials and property owners, causing them to miss the state’s initial nine-month deadline to begin operations. 
And not every town is willing to have a  cannabis retailer. In 2022, voters in six communities — Barrington, East Greenwich, Jamestown, Little Compton, Scituate, and Smithfield — rejected allowing retail pot shops within their borders.
Ballou said if regulators really need to give some applicants more time to get all their needed material together, those businesses should be subject to a second lottery.
Sasha Gorski, co-owner of the cultivation company Talaria, agreed, saying the 60-day window to secure local zoning permits after the application deadline shouldn’t apply to general retail applicants.
“It hurts to be punished for being ahead,” she said.
But others in the room argued the commission’s review timeline helps to create a sense of fairness as the retail industry starts to grow in Rhode Island.
“Applicants need breathing room to go through the proper channels,” Emma Karnes, an organizer for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 238, told the commission. “I think we all want a healthy pool of applicants. We all want a reasonably accessible application process.”

Karnes said many applicants seeking social equity and worker cooperative licenses may not have the same resources and capital as other prospective business owners. Such is the case for Alexa Goodrich-Houska, who is seeking to open the Living Room Cannabis Cooperative somewhere in Zone 1, which includes the communities of Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield, Smithfield, and Woonsocket.
“We don’t have trust funds, we don’t have big corporate backers,” Goodrich-Houska said. “Documentation alone can take four to 12 months and around $50,000 to know if we can even get a license.”
That’s on top of the $7,500 application fee, a yearly $30,000 licensing fee that all cannabis retailers face — though that application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants.
Ahern acknowledged industry members’ concerns and continued frustration over new licenses not yet being issued, but reminded them it was never going to be a rubber stamp process.
“We expect a very robust, thorough process,” she said. “That was never going to be done overnight, that was never going to be done in a few weeks.”
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives. All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Applicants have up to 60 days to demonstrate they have final zoning approval from the municipality where they intend to operate their business — a provision Ahern said was included partly because of the commission’s slow rollout in getting potential social equity applicants certified.










Applicants need breathing room to go through the proper channels. I think we all want a healthy pool of applicants. We all want a reasonably accessible application process.


– Emma Karnes, an organizer for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 238


The commission in late August opened the initial screening process for social equity applicants, defined as prospective retailers owned or mostly staffed by those adversely affected by the war on drugs. After the certification deadline closed on Sept. 29, the commission reported 94 potential applicants for the state’s six social equity licenses.
Beginning Monday, screened applicants were expected to receive letters informing them if they meet the state’s social equity criteria. Prospective applicants who don’t initially meet the commission’s requirements will have 10 additional days to prove they qualify as social equity applicants.
​​Regulations approved by the commission earlier in the year require that social equity applicants have at least 51% ownership and control by individuals directly impacted by past cannabis laws or economic disparities, or a minimum of 10 full-time employees that meet the same criteria.
Qualifying factors include convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses or residency in disproportionately impacted areas — which can be determined by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. 
Final certification is expected to be approved by the commission some time in November.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Members of the committee tasked with finding LSU’s next president have been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement that prohibits them from ever discussing the search. 
The search committee is a public body that is subject to Louisiana’s open meetings and public records laws, which call for such deliberations to be made in a public setting and for any related documents to be available upon request. 
Steven Procopio, president of the good government watchdog group Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, called for more transparency in the presidential search. 
“The LSU presidency is one of Louisiana’s most important public positions, and its selection should reflect that public trust,” Procopio said. “Transparency in the search process would build confidence that more than one candidate was seriously considered.” 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who has previously touted the transparency of the committee, said the non-disclosure agreements are intended to protect the identity of potential job candidates. 
Ballard cited a state court ruling in the case Capital City Press v. LSU, in which The Advocate, along with other news organizations, sued the university when it refused to provide records on the search to replace former President F. King Alexander in 2012-13.  
The precedent requires the public release of documents related to candidates once they officially apply, but universities can withhold information on those who have only expressed interest. All of the state’s college and university systems must follow this ruling when conducting searches for top administrators.  
But the terms of the non-disclosure agreement LSU’s current search committee members have signed go much further, according to a copy of the agreement provided to the Illuminator. Read the full NDA below. 
It prohibits the discussion of deliberations of the committee or release of documents relating to the search. Members are instead required to refer all questions from journalists or the public to Ballard or SSA Consultants, the consulting firm LSU hired to guide the search. 
The agreement also prohibits committee members from keeping search-related documents after the process concludes. They must also maintain this secrecy in perpetuity. Members who break the terms of the agreement will lose their spot on the committee. 
Requiring members of public bodies to refrain from discussing the work of that body is unusual, according to Scott Sternberg, a First Amendment attorney who often represents the news media. 
“The members of that search committee have First Amendment rights … and making them sign a non-disclosure agreement is certainly a new attempt to keep a lid on people performing a public service,” Sternberg said. 
LSU considers those who have responded to its presidential job posting as having only expressed interest in the job – and not applicants. Their names will be vetted by SSA Consultants, who will present a list of qualified individuals to the search committee. Its members will invite a select number of those individuals to formally apply, at which point their names will be public record. 
SSA Consultants CEO Christel Slaughter said at a meeting earlier this month about 30 people have expressed interest for the LSU position, with 20 meeting the qualifications and five to nine highly qualified.
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said non-disclosure agreements are standard operating procedure. He has not responded to the Illuminator’s request to review any non-disclosure agreements the university has used for previous leadership searches. 
Mark Romero, chairman of the University of Louisiana System Board, said the UL System does not require members of its search committees to sign non-disclosure agreements. The board has conducted searches for presidents for eight of its nine universities within the past four years and did not use consultants. 
Romero said he did not see the point in using non-disclosure agreements when the information would be subject to public records requests regardless. 
The LSU position has been vacant since June when former President William Tate resigned after four years to accept the same position at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Vice President for Agriculture Matt Lee is serving as interim president and is expected to apply for the permanent job. 
The board is expected to make a final hiring decision next month.

Delaware’s geography gives a Hydrogen Business a unique advantage: abundant water, existing industrial infrastructure, and proximity to East Coast markets.
By Staff Writer | Oct. 20, 2025
WILMINGTON, Del. — Hydrogen may be the smallest element on the periodic table, but it could hold outsize promise for Delaware’s energy future. That was the message Monday from Andrew Cottone III, chemist, entrepreneur, and founder of Eternium, who joined M. Jane Brady on her program A Better Discussion to explain what a hydrogen business actually does — and why it could help power Delaware’s economy for decades to come.
Cottone, best known for turning his first company, Adesis, from near bankruptcy to a multimillion-dollar success, now wants to make Delaware a model for clean hydrogen production. His new venture, he said, blends chemistry, economics, and opportunity.

“Hydrogen burns three times as much energy by mass as carbon-based fuels — strong and clean,” Cottone said. “We are sitting on the prepackaged fuel of the future, which is water.”


Hydrogen’s promise and Delaware’s potential
Hydrogen is already one of the world’s most widely used industrial gases, fueling refineries, fertilizer plants, and steel production. But most of today’s hydrogen — called gray hydrogen — is made from natural gas in processes that emit carbon dioxide. The next step is scaling up “green hydrogen,” produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity from renewable or nuclear power.
When hydrogen is burned or used in a fuel cell, it emits only water vapor — no carbon dioxide, soot, or methane. For supporters, that makes it a bridge fuel to a low-carbon future, especially for heavy industry and long-distance transport that can’t easily electrify.

“It’s truly cyclical,” Cottone said. “You split water into hydrogen and oxygen, use the hydrogen for power, and it becomes water again.”

Hydrogen can also store surplus renewable energy from the grid — capturing solar or wind power when it’s available and releasing it when demand peaks.

“Hydrogen doesn’t compete with renewables — it completes them,” Cottone said. “It’s the storage tank that makes solar and wind reliable 24 hours a day.”

Economic case for Delaware
Cottone said Delaware’s geography gives it a unique advantage: abundant water, existing industrial infrastructure, and proximity to East Coast markets. Each hydrogen plant would use about two-thirds of an Olympic-size swimming pool of water per day, and could repurpose treated wastewater, reducing environmental strain.
He expects Eternium’s planned facilities to generate hundreds of construction jobs and dozens of full-time technical positions. The company is an anchor member of the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2) — a regional partnership awarded $23 million in early-stage funding to build hydrogen infrastructure across Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

“With or without government funding, we go forward,” Cottone said. “We have a responsible business model that pencils out.”

Cottone also serves on Delaware’s new Nuclear Task Force, where he promotes synergy between hydrogen and advanced nuclear energy to achieve long-term energy independence.

“Delaware imports 100 times more energy than we make ourselves,” he said. “This isn’t about if — it’s about how we do this responsibly to position Delaware as a net exporter of energy.”

Opposition from environmental and river advocates
Not everyone shares that optimism. Several regional environmental groups — including the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, led by Maya van Rossum — have voiced concern about the climate and ecological impact of the MACH2 hub.
Van Rossum argues that hydrogen development could extend the life of the fossil-fuel industry, since most hydrogen today is produced from natural gas, releasing greenhouse gases.

“Hydrogen hubs are being used as a way for fossil-fuel interests to stay relevant,” van Rossum said in 2023, warning that the technology’s current reliance on natural gas undermines its clean-energy claims.

Her group also objects to the use of nuclear power in some hub proposals, citing environmental damage from facilities like the Salem Nuclear Generating Station on the Delaware River, which studies suggest harms billions of fish and larvae each year through its cooling-water system.
Environmental-justice organizations have raised additional concerns that proposed hydrogen facilities and pipelines could be sited near vulnerable or historically overburdened communities.
MACH2 officials, including Cottone, maintain that Delaware’s approach would prioritize local sourcing, clean-water use, and state-level oversight, ensuring both environmental protection and economic benefit.
Workforce and education
Cottone and Brady agreed Delaware’s energy future must include a plan for training local workers. Cottone’s earlier partnership with Delaware Technical Community College created certification programs that retrained former press operators for chemical manufacturing jobs — a model he plans to expand to hydrogen production.

“Our future employees are already here,” he said. “We can train them in nine to twelve months for high-quality jobs that stay in Delaware.”

A “Pete du Pont moment” for Delaware
Cottone traces his hydrogen vision back to the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation’s Reinventing Delaware program, which helped him refine the idea of hydrogen as both a clean-energy and economic-development strategy.

“I call it a Pete du Pont moment — reinventing Delaware,” he said. “Energy is the stem cell of an economy. The more responsible, clean energy you have, the more your economy can grow.”

Brady agreed, noting that the success of hydrogen and nuclear initiatives could determine whether Delaware once again becomes a national model for innovation and self-reliance.

Editor’s Fact Box: Hydrogen and Delaware’s Economy
1. Job Creation — Hydrogen manufacturing could generate 150–200 construction jobs per plant and 40–60 permanent technical roles, with ripple effects across local suppliers.2. Clean-Tech Cluster Growth — Hydrogen development attracts investment in advanced materials, logistics, and renewable-energy research.3. Reuse of Infrastructure — Vacant industrial land and wastewater systems can be repurposed, revitalizing communities.4. Energy Independence — Local hydrogen production reduces Delaware’s dependence on imported power.5. Revenue for Schools and Services — New plants expand property, business, and payroll tax bases across all three counties.6. Balancing Environment and Economy — Supporters say hydrogen’s benefits outweigh its risks; opponents warn that its climate advantages depend on how it’s produced and where it’s built.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-170230.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:16:48.949420

Trump announced Sunday on his Truth social media platform that Mark Savaya, the owner of Leaf and Bud dispensaries throughout southeast Michigan, would serve in the role.
“Mark’s deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship, and his connections in the region, will help advance the interests of the American people,” Trump wrote. “Mark was a key player in my campaign in Michigan, where he, and others, helped secure a record vote with Muslim Americans.”
Savaya thanked Trump in an Instagram post, saying he was “deeply humbled and grateful to [Trump]” for his appointment.
“I am committed to strengthening the U.S.-Iraq partnership under President Trump’s leadership and guidance,” Savaya said. “Thank you, Mr. President.”
Savaya, a member of the Catholic Chaldean community that has deep roots in Metro Detroit, was a prominent supporter of Trump during his 2020 and 2024 campaigns. His personal Instagram page is riddled with pictures and videos of Savaya either hanging out with Trump or within his orbit, including a video where Savaya appears to be at Trump’s Florida Mar-A-Lago resort.
He donated $10,000 to Trump’s campaign in 2020, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Savaya also supported the 2024 campaign at rallies and was seen with the current president and his surrogates during other events.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2198395626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 20:56:57+00:00,CT Mirror,Attorneys in Diamantis trial deliver closing arguments as case goes to jury,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/kosta-diamantis-trial-closing-arguments/,"The closing arguments were the last thing jurors heard before they were asked to decide the fate of Diamantis, who is charged with 21 counts.","Attorneys delivering closing arguments in the federal criminal trial of Konstantinos Diamantis Monday presented jurors with dueling descriptions of the man who ran Connecticut’s school construction program for nearly six years.
The closing arguments were the last thing jurors heard before they were asked to decide the fate of Diamantis, who is charged with 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
Federal prosecutors presented Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, as a money-hungry official who eagerly traded his influence on school building projects for bribes from construction contractors.
“The defendant was a corrupt public officials. He asked for and accepted bribes,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Novick, adding that Diamantis also wielded his immense influence on projects to “strike fear” into contractors.
Meanwhile, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, portrayed his client as a dutiful and devoted public servant, who used his aggressive personality to save taxpayers money on the state-funded school projects.
Pattis argued that Diamantis was someone who “rocked some boats” when he took over the school construction program in 2016, particularly frustrating those  contractors who were reaping huge profits on school construction projects.
“You heard him described as a person who got the job done even if he ruffled feathers,” Pattis said, adding that Diamantis “”knew how to shine sunlight into dark places.” 
Diamantis took the witness stand in his own defense and acknowledged that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars from Acranom Masonry, a company that worked on schools in Hartford and Tolland. He also admitted that his daughter was hired by Construction Advocacy Professionals, another company that was awarded work in Hartford, Tolland and New Britain. 
In both cases, he said he never used his position to benefit those contractors.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis told the jury Monday that Diamantis essentially admitted to some of the charges, namely bribery, when he acknowledged receiving payments from the two contractors.
“That was remarkable testimony by the defendant,” Francis said, adding that Diamantis was essentially forced into that testimony because of the overwhelming amount of direct evidence that prosecutors presented to the jury.
Francis also said Diamantis admitted that he threatened to remove Acranom from two school projects if the company’s executives didn’t pay him tens of thousand of dollars.
“The defendant took the stand and admitted to making every one of those threats,” Francis said. “I mean, how could he deny it?”
Diamantis sat at the defense table smiling as the federal prosecutors delivered their closing arguments. He shook his head when Francis argued that Diamantis’ testimony effectively counted as a “confession” to the bribery and extortion charges.
When it was his turn to address the jury, Pattis argued that Diamantis’ financial entanglements with the two contractors were not illegal because he never used his government position to benefit either company. 
Pattis told the jury there was no “quid pro quo” between Diamantis and Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals. 
And he argued that John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry, was the one who was extorting from Diamantis. Pattis pointed to several text messages that suggested that Duffy expected to receive part of the money that Diamantis negotiated with Sal Monarca, the owner of Acranom Masonry.
In response to that argument, Francis told the jury that Diamantis should still be convicted of bribery and extortion even if Duffy did get half the money. 
“I don’t know if Duffy was double dealing, but either way he was engaged in a conspiracy,” Francis said. “It’s not really a great defense to extortion and bribery that I gave half the money to my bagman.” 
“What the defendant is doing is distracting you from the evidence,” Francis added. 
As he made an impassioned plea for jurors to acquit Diamantis, Pattis observed that some of the jurors might not like Diamantis. He even noted that some of the jurors were rolling their eyes when he argued that Diamantis was not involved in accepting bribes from the companies.
But Pattis argued that federal prosecutors did not prove all of the elements for the crimes of which Diamantis is accused, especially when it came to the extortion charges. And he pleaded with the jury not to judge his client based on their feelings toward him.
“Think what you will of him, but hold the government to their burden of proof,” Pattis said.
Francis had the last word before the case was handed off to the jury, and he used those final moments to push back against on Pattis’ description of Diamantis as the one person who was looking to fix the state’s school construction program.
“Even if school construction did need to be cleaned up, the evidence shows the defendant had the dirtiest hands of all,” Francis said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_046-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Bruce Silcox)Microplastics were found in every sample tested from 40 lakes, rivers and streams across Minnesota, according to a report recently released by Environment Minnesota Research and Policy Center.
Plastic that makes its way into the environment degrades into microplastics over time, small pieces of plastic that don’t decompose like organic waste. The presence of microplastics in all tested waterways highlights one consequence of Minnesota’s plastic waste — Minnesota disposed of more than 650,000 tons of plastic in 2022, just 10% of which was recycled, according to studies cited in the report.
Microplastics is a relatively new and evolving area of study. Researchers have found microplastics in human tissues and organs, including in the brain, which enter the body through breathing or ingestion. Scientists don’t know the precise negative effects on wildlife and humans but are actively exploring them.
“We just don’t know and hopefully we can continue to fund the efforts to figure out what these microplastics can do,” said Katelynn Rolfes, the author of the report.
Studies have shown that microplastics harm metabolism, neurological function and reproduction in animals, and a few epidemiological studies have shown that microplastics are correlated with various chronic diseases in humans. For example, a 1999 study looked at multiple instances of work-related lung disease in U.S. and Canadian nylon fiber workers.
All 40 sites contained synthetic fibers, which come from clothing and textiles; 10 sites contained harder plastic fragments; and five sites contained film from bags and flexible plastics. The study did not find any microbeads, which are tiny plastics found in body scrubs and other beauty products.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated in 2017 that 35% of microplastics come from the degradation of synthetic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, typically from clothes and textiles.
The report is based on samples collected by citizen volunteers and staff from Environment Minnesota between May and September.
The report lists several policy recommendations to mitigate microplastics, including phasing out single-use plastics and plastic bags, implementing a refundable deposit for plastic bottles and passing laws preventing clothing manufacturers from overproducing.
Minnesota passed an “extended producer responsibility” law in 2024 requiring packaging producers to shoulder more of the responsibility for disposing or recycling their products, though it has not yet joined the states entertaining EPR legislation for textile producers. California was the first state to pass an EPR law for textiles in 2024, and similar bills have been proposed in New York and Washington.
Starting in 2017, Minnesota banned local jurisdictions from enacting their own single-use or plastic bag bans. State policy is split on the issue — 19 states have some statewide single-use plastic ban, while 19 states, including Minnesota, don’t have bans and also forbid local jurisdictions from enacting bans. The remaining states don’t have statewide bans but also allow local governments to make their own regulations.
Minnesota legislators have, in the past few years, introduced bills to reverse the ban on plastic bag bans, though they have yet to pass.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101625enviroMN111-1024x817.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

Kristin Robbins, who is running for Minnesota governor, released her proposals to prevent fraud in Minnesota programs at a Capitol press conference on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican candidate for governor, rolled out a fraud prevention agenda Monday as she seeks to amp up a key vulnerability of Gov. Tim Walz, who is seeking a third term.
Robbins, a Maple Grove Republican and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, 
proposed an independent office of inspector general to regularly audit programs, bolstering the state’s oversight of providers that receive taxpayer funds and appointing commissioners who will create a “no fraud, no excuses” culture.
“Walz turned Minnesota into the fraud capital of the country. As governor, I will make it a fraud free capital for America,” Robbins said at a Capitol press conference.
Fraudsters have in recent years have gamed state government — and federal programs administered by Minnesota — out of hundreds of millions of dollars, including the infamous Feeding Our Future scandal, the state’s autism program and a bevy of Medicaid schemes.
Walz has touted various measures he’s enacted to prevent fraud, including an executive order establishing a statewide Inspector General Coordinating Council, though it’s unclear exactly what this council will do. His administration also shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program, which Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said, while announcing indictments, is riddled with fraud. Walz has also increased data-sharing across state agencies and established a financial crimes and fraud division at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
Robbins said that currently a lot of employees within agencies want to prevent fraud, but they don’t have the training and agency heads haven’t taken action when credible allegations of fraud arise.
Robbins was first elected to the House in 2018, representing west metro cities like Maple Grove, Medina and Corcoran.
Scott Jensen, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor, and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive, are also challenging Walz and vying for the GOP nomination.
As governor, Robbins said she would order a top-to-bottom audit of all of the Department of Human Service’s Medicaid programs, where the bulk of fraud in Minnesota’s programs has occurred.
“The Walz administration has prioritized shoveling money out the door and counting that as a success. Instead, we are going to standardize the basic due diligence that Minnesotans have thought was going on and that they expect of their state government,” Robbins said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P1241836-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/USDA)Iowa and national agriculture groups said Monday that a proposal from President Donald Trump to import beef from Argentina would harm cattle farmers. 
Trump suggested Sunday the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina to help address the high cost of beef at grocery stores.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for ground chuck have risen sharply in 2025. August figures topped $6.63 per pound, which is up more than a dollar from prices in January. 
The bureau shows that beef prices have been on the rise over the past 10 years, likely due to declining herd sizes and drought. But more recent pressures from the new world screwworm and tariffs have likely added to the recent inflation in cost.

Trump, in an official address Oct. 16, said that the administration had a deal in the works that would bring down the price of beef. He floated the idea of purchasing from Argentina while speaking to reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One.
Bryan Whaley, CEO of Iowa Cattlemen’s Association, said the industry group is working to communicate with leaders about their concerns with the Argentina plan, “specifically the impact on cattle market prices.” 
“President Trump’s recent remarks about potentially importing Argentinian beef are concerning for U.S. cattle producers, and the little detail that accompanied those comments has created volatility in the market,” Whaley said in an emailed statement. “What we know is that consumer demand for the high-quality beef raised by U.S. producers has remained strong, despite the increased costs caused by drought, border closures, and high input costs to producers.” 
Whaley said the group will continue to elevate the issue to “avoid intervention and let the market work.” 
Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President Brent Johnson said Monday that the cattle market, where producers have positive returns on their livestock, was one of the “few bright spots in Iowa’s ag economy” amid “widespread depressed ag markets.” 
“We encourage the administration to resist actions that negatively impact the cattle farmers in Iowa and domestic beef production,” Johnson said in a statement. 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said importing from Argentina would harm cattle producers and disrupt the free market. 
“This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,” the association’s CEO Colin Woodall Woodall said in a news release. 
Additionally, the national association said Argentina has a “deeply unbalanced” trade relationship with the U.S. given the country imports more beef from Argentina than it exports to the South American country.
“We call on President Trump and members of Congress to let the market work, rather than intervening in ways that do nothing but harm rural America,” the news release said. 
The floated idea from the president comes less than a month after the administration approved a $20 billion credit-line swap with Argentina and proposed an additional $20 billion in financing to help the country. Shortly after the first deal was announced, Argentina delivered a massive sale of soybeans to China, potentially harming U.S. trade with its largest soybean buyer.
National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said in a statement the union was also against importing beef from Argentina, noting the recent news between the U.S. and Argentina. 
“The last thing we need is to reward them by importing more of their beef,” Larew said. 
He said importing foreign beef would be a form of “undercutting American ranchers” and said  “restoring fairness” in the market should be the target to lower grocery store prices.
“In times of extreme uncertainty in the farm economy, we should be doubling down on our efforts to support family farmers and ranchers here at home,” Larew said. “The answer isn’t foreign beef; it’s rebuilding herds to meet domestic demand, restoring competition in meatpacking, enacting mandatory country-of-origin labeling so consumers know where their beef comes from, and creating a fair marketplace that works for both farmers and consumers.” 
Trump said Sunday, while speaking to reporters, that Argentina is “fighting for their life.” 
“They have no money, they have no anything,” Trump said. “They’re fighting so hard to survive. If I can help them survive in a free world – I happen to like the president of Argentina.”

(Photo by Christina Felschen/Getty Images)The state of West Virginia is investing $19 million to help upgrade and replace portions of Clarksburg’s aging water infrastructure, according to an announcement from Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Monday.
The money will help support the Clarksburg Water Board with its ongoing replacement of hazardous lead service lines in the area, which can pose serious health risks to exposed individuals. It will also assist with upgrading the system’s water mains, enhancing fire protection, decreasing leaks and modernizing water meters for customers throughout the system.
“Every West Virginian should be able to turn on the tap and know that the water coming out is safe,” Morrisey said. “For too long, aging infrastructure has threatened the health and safety of our communities. This investment is about restoring trust in our public systems.”
According to its 2025 annual report with the state Public Service Commission, the Clarksburg Water Board provides water service to about 7,800 households in the area. It sells water to thousands of other customers. 
The $19 million committed to Clarksburg by the state this month will help cover costs associated with the final phase of the city’s ongoing lead line replacement project.
The total cost of that project phase — phase 3B, according to Clarksburg Water Board General Manager Jason Myers — is $50 million.
Myers said the project will “hopefully” go to bid in January or February of 2026. Construction would then start around June. It will take three to four years for the project to then be completed, Myers said.
Once phase 3A is complete, Myers said about 2,400 lead service lines will remain that will need to be removed during phase 3B.
The city began work to replace its lead service lines after blood tests between 2020 and 2021 showed that several children in the Clarksburg area had elevated levels of lead in their blood due to exposure from eroding and aging water service lines. 
Residents in Clarksburg — including the parents of two of those children — filed a class action lawsuit against the Water Board in 2021. They alleged in the suit that the water from the system was not safe to drink and that the water system’s leadership failed to ensure its safety by not monitoring lead levels adequately.
That same year, the Clarksburg Water Board received administrative orders from both the state health department and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to draw up a corrective action plan. That plan was meant to eradicate the presence of lead in the water system and correct numerous violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Residents at that time were provided with water filters for their homes to help prevent exposure to the lead pipes.
Experts and those in the industry said it was rare for the EPA to issue such an order to a locality. The lead levels detected, however, were so high that Erik Olson, senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the situation “could be as bad as Flint, if not worse.”
In July 2021, the Clarksburg Water Board approved the first preliminary action plan. Since then, work has been ongoing to both detail the problem and correct it. That work has coincided with a federal rule implemented under former President Joe Biden in 2024 that requires all water systems throughout the country to find and replace millions of lead service lines by 2037.
Under that rule, West Virginia would need to find and replace at least 3% of its existing water service lines, according to EPA’s most recent Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey Assessment. Billions of dollars were made available federally for lead service line replacements through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by congress and signed by Biden in 2021.
Under President Donald Trump, however, the federal rule requiring lead line replacement as well as the funding that would make it possible for West Virginia could be under threat.
In August, Trump’s EPA said it would defend the newly amended federal Lead and Copper rule — the changes made within it represented the largest update made in more than 30 years. Details, however, remain unclear on how it will be implemented as the Trump Administration has focused heavily on environmental deregulation and cuts to government spending.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is hiring two outside advisers to help address an operating budget shortfall and related questions from state regulators.
The not-for-profit will work with Ovation Healthcare, a national support organization, and David Sanville, a former chief financial officer at Windsor’s Mt. Ascutney Hospital, according to a social media announcement.
“Let me say this very clearly: Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is not closing,” acting co-CEO Elizabeth McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, said in a Facebook video posted Friday.
“We are fully engaged,” added fellow leader Tony Blofson, a primary care physician, “in ensuring that BMH remains a strong, independent and trusted part of this community.”
Administrators are still calculating the exact shortfall in a $119 million annual budget that ended Sept. 30. They’ve usually offered updates through internal emails to the hospital’s more than 500 staffers and 150 community “corporator” supporters. To reach more people, McLarney and Blofson — appointed interim leaders after this month’s unexplained leave of absence of CEO Christopher Dougherty — publicized their latest message on Facebook.
In a minute-long video, the two read a shared statement that aimed to reassure the 45,000 residents in the hospital’s service area.
“For generations, BMH has been a cornerstone of care in this region,” Blofson said. “We’re going to keep it that way by adapting and innovating, doing whatever it takes to continue to provide you with the highest quality care.”
“We’re in this with you, and we are here to stay,” McLarney added. “Thank you for your trust, support and patience.”
Administrators at the 61-bed hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, have blamed their fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs. In response, they have launched a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators.
But regulators at Vermont’s Green Mountain Care Board have questioned the budget numbers themselves, noting in an Oct. 1 ruling that “missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
The board ordered the hospital to revise its budget or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law. 
In a written update to VTDigger, regulators noted “it is our understanding that BMH is working diligently to address concerns” and the board would review the new numbers once received.
Hospital leaders hope the outside advisers will help. On its website, Ovation Healthcare says it has worked with more than 375 hospitals and health systems in 47 states, including the nearby Springfield Hospital, a 25-bed facility that had to reorganize its finances through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in 2019 and 2020.
“Springfield Hospital,” the Ovation site says, “went from one day’s cash on hand and millions owed to vendors and banks to a lower total debt, improved cash flow and positive days cash.”
Five years later, the Green Mountain Care Board noted in a recent ruling that “Springfield is an efficient hospital that can deliver care at lower-than-average cost.” That said, regulators added, “we are concerned about Springfield’s financial health” because of smaller yet continued negative operating margins in the past three fiscal years.

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)A coalition of North Carolina voting rights advocates on Monday denounced newly proposed congressional maps they say would dismantle the state’s historic Black Belt district and erode Black political power in the state’s northeast.
The group held a press conference hours after a Senate committee adopted a redistricting plan that would make the 1st Congressional District more favorable to Republicans. It is North Carolina’s only competitive United States House seat.
The 1st District, anchored in northeastern North Carolina, has elected Black representatives for more than three decades. It is currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, who won reelection last year by less than two points. Under the new map, Davis’s home county of Greene would be moved into the adjacent 3rd District, represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy. Members of Congress are not required to live in their districts.
Voting rights advocates said the proposal would split up communities that have long shared historical and economic ties, particularly in the state’s Black Belt region. The district includes several majority-Black counties such as Halifax, Hertford and Bertie — areas that have been the backbone of Black political participation in North Carolina since the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.
“Please don’t buy into it when someone says ‘This isn’t about race, it’s about party,’ because those two things are intertwined,” said Kat Roblez, senior voting rights counsel with Forward Justice.
“This map … is really a retaliation against the people of the 1st District for the audacity to select the representative that the General Assembly doesn’t approve of … and was drawn explicitly for political gain,” said Marques Thompson, organizing director for Democracy North Carolina and a district resident.
Ashley Mitchell, a staff attorney with Forward Justice who also lives in the 1st District, said the redistricting plan threatens communities that fought for decades to gain representation. “It’s the people power that pisses off our legislature, which is why we see so much pushback against the voters,” said Ashley Mitchell, a staff attorney with Forward Justice. We are not going to sit back. We are going to fight back in 2026 and show that the people truly do have the power to elect our representatives and leaders, whether they like it or not.”
Republicans currently hold 10 of North Carolina’s 14 congressional seats. With the new map, the GOP could expand its advantage to 11–3, a shift that comes as former President Donald Trump pushes to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterms.
“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), said as he presented the plan in the Senate Elections committee Monday. “Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives. And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”
Trump posted on social media thanking North Carolina Republicans for the plan, calling it an opportunity to “elect another MAGA Republican” next year. 
Gov. Josh Stein called the proposal a “cynical power grab” during a news conference Monday morning. “The Republican legislature is abusing its power to take away yours,” Stein said, as he urged lawmakers to instead pass new spending for the state’s mental health system and Medicaid.
Shruti Parikh, director of education & political engagement for North Carolina Asian Americans Together, said the state’s majority-Republican leadership is “taking the coward’s way out and putting a thumb on the scale.” She added that North Carolinians “deserve leadership that works for us, not politicians who twist the rules to protect their own power.”
Former U.S. Reps. Eva Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, who both represented the 1st District, also criticized the plan, saying it would “silence communities that have long been the backbone of northeastern North Carolina.” In a joint statement released through Common Cause NC, they called the map “a moral regression” and condemned the lack of public input.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-NC-Map-1024x666.png,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The chairman of the State Election Commission did not read the agency’s budget request, which included a payment he claimed was far beyond what the commission approved, before signing off on it last year, he said Monday.
Dennis Shedd has repeatedly said he and other commissioners thought voting machines bought last year would cost $28 million in taxpayer money. He blamed recently fired executive director Howard Knapp for not telling commissioners about an additional $4 million in the contract, which Shedd said commissioners learned about in the past two weeks.

FY26 E280 - Election Commission (1) 
But in September 2024, Shedd signed off on a budget request that included $32 million for new ballot scanners. Shedd’s signature and printed name appeared beneath a line affirming he had “reviewed and approved” the plan, “which is complete and accurate to the extent of my knowledge,” according to the document.
Shedd didn’t know about the discrepancy because he didn’t read the 32-page document, he told reporters following a State Election Commission meeting Monday.
“I probably didn’t even thumb through it,” Shedd said.
Shedd again faulted Knapp, who he has accused of creating a “toxic and perhaps hostile work environment” within the 65-person agency and misrepresenting the contract to commissioners, for not telling the commission about the increase in price.
An attorney representing Knapp has not responded to requests for comment Monday or last week.
The commission’s work is on a voluntary basis, so commissioners shouldn’t be expected to comb through budget requests, Shedd said.
“That’s not our job normally,” Shedd said. “We don’t take apart the budget and requests for expenses line by line.”
Gov. Henry McMaster appointed Shedd to the commission as its chairman in March 2024, saying in a statement at the time he was “uniquely qualified to lead the state election commission” because of his 12 years as a U.S. district judge. The governor’s office declined to comment Monday. The governor is responsible for appointing the entire governing board.
The five-member commission, which currently has one vacancy, acts as the executive director’s boss by overseeing and approving the director’s work, including spending.
Chairs for boards and commissions overseeing state agencies must sign off on budget requests alongside their respective executive directors. The requests, submitted in the fall to the state Department of Administration, start the process for the next budget year.
Unlike other board chairs, however, Shedd asked agency staff to add a line that he claimed showed he did not take responsibility for the accuracy of the request. The first page behind the sign-off cover sheet was a listing of 10 funding requests that totaled nearly $43.7 million, with the $32 million for a “voting system upgrade” at the top.
SC Election Commission has questions about $32M contract after firing director

“This document was completed by agency staff in compliance with state law and thereafter transmitted to the Department of Administration,” reads the “disclaimer,” as Shedd called the addition.
The first time Shedd saw the $32 million listed in the budget request was when reporters showed him a copy Monday, he said. Even if he had read through the document, he wasn’t sure he would have known whether the money was for the contract commissioners had authorized or if some of the money was meant to go elsewhere, he said.
Shedd wouldn’t have signed off if he saw the $32 million and understood where it was going, he said. He would have asked Knapp to go back to the company selling the voting equipment and attempt to negotiate the price down.
“I can tell you this much: If I had an inkling that $32 million represented that deal on the voting machines, I would have said, ‘Wait, wait,’” Shedd said.
Each item in a budget request includes a brief explanation for lawmakers of how the agency plans to spend the money. The election commission planned to use the $32 million to pay off a loan used to purchase ballot scanners and tabulators provided to every county, according to the description in the document.
Instead of reading through the request, or the included summary sheet, Shedd relied on Knapp to go over the highlights out loud during commission meetings, including any changes in amounts, he said.
“Don’t you have to take it that the person who’s working for the agency is truthful and is disclosing everything to you?” Shedd said. “Don’t you assume that?”
What began as a $28 million agreement ballooned without the commission’s knowledge, Shedd said.
The agreement Knapp made with the voting machine company came out to be about $800,000 higher than what the commission had authorized, and the loan he signed through the treasurer’s office was higher still. Knapp signed a second loan in January to add on about $2 million in sales taxes not included in the initial deal, said interim director Jenny Wooten, who took over when Knapp was fired last month.
The agency was supposed to make its first payment by Sept. 30 on machines bought and put in place ahead of last November’s election.
But it won’t get its $11 million that legislators approved in the state budget until February. That’s because the Legislature put a directive in the state budget delaying one-time allotments to agencies in case last year’s surplus would be needed to plug any gap due to an economic downturn for ongoing expenses.
Late fees on the voting machine bill start Oct. 30. Delaying the first payment is expected to cost the commission an additional $140,000, bringing the total for the ballot scanners, with interest, to more than $33 million.
The bank financing the loan agreed to push back the first installment, and the commission unanimously agreed Monday to authorize a change to the contract, allowing the agency to avoid defaulting on its payments.
Despite Shedd saying repeatedly he would have scrutinized every part of the document if he knew what he knows now, the chairman acknowledged he did not thoroughly examine the request submitted last week for the budget slated to begin June 1, 2026.
Shedd took home the request, “looked through it generally,” then told Wooten everything seemed fine and signed his name, he said. He again relied on Wooten, who mentioned a $25 million request to pay off the remainder of the loan during the last meeting, to get everything right, he said.
“I don’t go through it line by line,” Shedd said of the requests.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4301-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

When Gallup first measured media trust in the 1970s, nearly 70% of Americans said they had confidence in newspapers, TV, and radio to report the news fairly and accurately. Today, that number has plunged to just 28%. Among Republicans, it’s a staggering 8%.
That’s not just a crisis — it’s an existential threat to journalism, if not democracy. But what, if anything, can be done about it?
One bold idea is about to be tested in Indianapolis: Hire an independent public editor — not tied to any single news outlet — to monitor and critique how local journalism is practiced.
A first of its kind
Think of it like a citywide ombudsman. This person would serve the public by analyzing news coverage across all local media — print, broadcast, radio and digital — and offer fair-minded feedback, praise, and criticism. The goal: to hold newsrooms accountable while helping citizens better understand how journalism works.
The nonprofit Poynter Institute is launching the pilot project, with funding from the Lumina Foundation and the Hearst Foundations. They’re calling the role a local public editor, and the concept is simple but ambitious.
Poynter senior vice president Kelly McBride says:
“The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also, when appropriate, to elevate great journalism.”
McBride should know. She currently is NPR’s public editor and once served in the same role for ESPN.
Serving two audiences
The public editor, McBride says, will serve two audiences. “Your first audience is the public. It’s right there in the title. But your second audience is the journalists. You’re looking at their work. What you want with that second audience is respect.”
The public editor should not expect miraculous change from journalists. “Nobody is ever going to call you up when you have criticized what they’ve done and say, Oh my god, you are 100% right and we are going to change the way we do this. That does not happen. I’ve done this for five years for NPR. Instead, what you see is the journalists making subtle changes to their work.”
Once in place, the editor will accept questions from readers and viewers about how specific stories were covered. They’ll investigate and report back — calling out flaws, celebrating strengths, and explaining newsroom decisions.
So far, only three Indianapolis news outlets have agreed to run the public editor’s work: a public radio station and two online publications. The Indianapolis Star and the main TV news outlets haven’t signed on. McBride says some had trouble getting corporate buy-in and others prefer a wait-and-see approach. Still the public editor will critique coverage from all news outlets in town and will publish the findings on the three cooperating news outlets.
Worth a try?
As a former news director, I admit — I might have been defensive if an outsider said they were going to publicly review our work. Journalism is tough enough without someone watching over your shoulder. But looking at those Gallup numbers, I might have come around. If it helps us serve our audience better, isn’t it worth a try?
One Indianapolis supporter is Phil Bremen, a former local news anchor, NBC News correspondent and longtime journalism professor at Ball State University in Muncie.
“I think it’s a great idea,” he told me. “So many people consume media without really understanding how it gets there — or how to separate the wheat from the chaff.”
Bremen hopes both sides benefit: citizens becoming smarter media consumers, and journalists improving their craft through thoughtful feedback. And when public criticism turns out to be off-base? That’s part of the process, too.
He hopes the public editor will “weigh the evidence and lay out the facts as he or she finds them. And on those occasions when a piece of reporting that’s come under criticism from the audience is exonerated, then that’s good news.”
McBride hopes to have the editor hired and up and running yet this year. She has enough funding for 18 months but hopes it will be extended beyond that.

In this Oct. 17, 2025, image, Girod delivers the annual State of the University speech at KU. (Photo taken by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The University of Kansas said Monday the chancellor privately shared insights about a proposed compact offering preferential treatment by the Trump administration in exchange for freezing tuition rates, limiting international student enrollment and restraining campus employees from expressing political views.
KU Chancellor Doug Girod, vice chair of the prestigious Association of American Universities, responded to a request Friday to provide feedback on President Donald Trump’s unprecedented plan to bring higher education institutions into line with his agenda.
Six of nine universities originally offered the Trump deal have rejected the offer, which was denounced in a statement by the American Council on Education and dozens of other education associations. KU’s last-minute role in a virtual meeting was sought along with that of Washington University in St. Louis as well as Arizona State University. It wasn’t clear if KU was asked to sign the deal with Trump as well.
“Chancellor Girod was invited to provide feedback to federal officials on the Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education and related matters impacting universities,” said Erinn Barcomb-Peterson, director of media relations at KU. “The chancellor described the discussion as productive, and federal officials were interested in his perspective.”
After the meeting, Linda McMahon, secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, the gathering with Girod and others was “an important step toward defending a shared vision.”
“With continued federal investment and strong institutional leadership, the higher education sector can do more to enhance American leadership in the world and build tomorrow’s workforce,” she said. “A renewed commitment to the time-honored principles that helped make American universities great will strengthen the country and deepen public confidence in higher education.”
The White House convened the group ahead of Monday’s deadline for reaction and comment from nine private and public institutions — KU wasn’t on that list — initially contacted by the Trump administration. No institutions have signed the agreement.
On Saturday, Dartmouth President Sian Beilock issued a statement that said she shared on the call that “I do not believe that a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas. ”
Paul Mahoney, interim president of the University of Virginia, said a contract with the federal government predicating assessment of students on anything other than merit would erode confidence in U.S. higher education and threatened to undermine lifesaving research programs.
The Trump administration since taking office in January has blocked billions of dollars in research grants in an effort to compel operational changes at U.S. universities and colleges. Reasons for the budget cuts included alleged antisemitism on campus; policies ensuring LGBTQ+ equality, and operation of programs tied to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Frustrated by pushback from higher education, the White House delivered letters Oct. 1 to select colleges and universities on the Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. The strategy was to invite voluntary compliance with changes the Trump administration could have difficult enforcing.
The Trump administration’s compact would mandate schools freeze tuition for five years, limit international students to 15% of undergraduate enrollment, impose standardized tests for admission, abide by a ban on DEI programs and adopt a definition of gender that would block transgender individuals from using restrooms or participating in sports that aligned with their gender identity.
In addition, the arrangement would forbid participating colleges and universities from allowing employees to express political views on behalf of their institutions. Academic departments offering opinions counter to views held by conservatives would have to be closed. Students and employees would be polled on compact compliance and the results released publicly. There would be financial penalties for institutions that violated pledges included in the deal.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that other colleges or universities beyond those contacted so far could be signers of the reform deal.
American Council on Education’s statement with 35 other organizations in opposition to the compact said Trump’s maneuvering raised concern about undermining qualities that made the U.S. educational system exceptional.
“The compact offers nothing less than government control of a university’s basic and necessary freedoms — the freedoms to decide who we teach, what we teach and who teaches,” the statement said. “The compact is just the kind of excessive federal overreach and regulation, to the detriment of state and local input and control, that this administration says it is against.’
The joint statement said the proposed compact would hamper ability of colleges and universities to innovate and make advancements that contributed to the nation’s economic well-being and security.
“It would hinder, not safeguard, freedom of expression for all points of view, and it will not assist in expanding social and economic mobility for all of our students,” the statement read.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Doug-Girod-KU-speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)PHILADELPHIA — A Department of Justice attorney on Monday urged a federal appeals panel to allow Alina Habba to remain New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor in a case likely to determine whether President Donald Trump can appoint U.S. attorneys without Senate approval.
Henry C. Whitaker, counselor to Attorney General Pamela Bondi, squared off with two attorneys challenging Habba’s legitimacy during nearly 90 minutes of arguments before three U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges at the James A. Byrne federal courthouse.
Whitaker defended the unprecedented series of moves Trump officials took in July to keep Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer, in the post after the Senate did not act on her nomination within the required 120-day time period set by statute.
Thousands protest Donald Trump at New Jersey No Kings rallies

Attorney Abbe Lowell, representing a criminal defendant who says Habba lacked authority to indict him, accused Trump officials of using “a jerry-rigged way” to maintain Habba in the role and implored the judges to uphold a lower court’s August ruling disqualifying her and banning her from further prosecutions (that ruling was stayed pending appeal).
Whitaker argued his case first, but barely a minute after he started speaking, a judge interrupted with a pointed question that set the tone for the rest of the hearing. Judge D. Brooks Smith noted the two titles Habba now has after the Trump administration’s maneuvers — acting U.S. attorney and special attorney.
“Which, what, who is this person, what actual position are they serving, and when?” Smith asked.
Whitaker explained that Habba became acting U.S. attorney by default after a head-spinning few July days during which New Jersey’s federal judges, in response to the Senate’s inaction, voted to replace Habba with her second-in-command, Desiree Leigh Grace, over the objections of the Trump administration. In response, Bondi fired Grace, named Habba special prosecutor, and delegated to her the authority to supervise all pending prosecutions. Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney, and Bondi appointed Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant U.S. attorney automatically becomes the acting U.S. attorney when the top job becomes vacant.
The timeline as described by Whitaker spawned a slew of questions from the jurists.
“Isn’t that a redundancy?” Smith asked.
“So she has full power as acting U.S. attorney?” Judge D. Michael Fisher chimed in.
“Are there any functional differences between those two positions, or are they just titles?” Smith followed up.
Lowell capitalized on the judges’ perplexity about both Habba’s string of job titles and the various statutes Whitaker cited to defend them.
“The government cites a chimera of seven different statutes that they alternate depending on what they are trying to accomplish, to call her,” Lowell said, ticking off Habba’s various job titles since she was first appointed in March.
He added: “She’s now asking the court to affirm she’s two things at one time.”
Lowell and James Pearce, representing the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, renewed their concerns that the Trump administration’s moves to reinstall Habba unconstitutionally bypassed checks and balances meant to protect the post’s independence.
“Executive branch practice must yield in the face of clear law,” Pearce told the judges. “At the core of this case, the government has thwarted Congress’s attempt and its constitutional obligation to regulate the filling of U.S. attorneys’ positions.”
The judges asked questions about Habba’s lack of prosecutorial experience, with Fisher noting language in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that allows the president to appoint someone as acting officer of an agency if that person has served 90 days in the agency during the prior year.
“It’s not the best and most clearest statute I’ve ever read, I’ll grant you that,” Fisher said. “It does say to me that Congress had a very specific intent – they wanted an experienced person.”
Whitaker responded: “There is no categorical requirement that there be any level of experience.”
The judges also pushed back on Whitaker’s claims that first assistant U.S. attorneys are political positions.
“First assistants are overwhelmingly political appointees,” Whitaker said.
Smith cut in, asking: “What do you consider a political appointee? Because all I can tell you, in my experience, is that the appointment of, selection of a first assistant in a U.S. attorney’s office is anything but a political appointee.”
Whitaker responded that first assistants serve at the will of the attorney general, making them “something akin to political appointees.”
The judges also mused whether Trump officials would continue to extend Habba’s term through successive appointments and asked whether her current titles have any time limits. Neither side offered a clear answer.
“We are not asking for a limitless power to appoint acting officials,” Whitaker said. “We color within the lines here.”
Smith called the sequence of events surrounding Habba’s appointment “unusual.”
“Can you come up with an example of any time that such a concatenation of events has occurred with respect to the appointment of a United States attorney?” he asked Whitaker.
“Well, I guess I cannot,” he responded.

 Blue slips
Habba did not attend the four-hour August hearing in Pennsylvania after which U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that she has served as the state’s top federal prosecutor “without lawful authority” since July 1 and voided all actions she has taken in that role since then.
But she showed up to Monday’s hearing with a broad smile, hugging various members of her large legal team before arguments started and asking them: “Ready to rock and roll?”
She did not speak during the hearing and declined to answer reporters’ questions afterward. Instead, she used social media to blast the “blue slip” tradition, in which a nominee’s home-state senators can block their confirmation. Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, have objected to Habba continuing in the role permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
“The continued invocation of blue slips, a tradition not a rule, demonstrates a politically motivated effort to impede the President’s constitutional authority to appoint U.S. Attorneys,” Habba wrote. “The President appoints individuals to carry out the mission of this administration and that mandate should be respected. When millions of Americans voted for a change in leadership in November, they voted for a new direction. That choice should not be undermined by political obstruction in Congress or by criminal defendants.”
Federal prosecutions have largely ground to a halt in New Jersey, as the challenge to Habba’s authority makes its way through the courts. The government shutdown, now in its third week, added to the courts’ paralysis, with Chief U.S. District Judge Renée Marie Bumb earlier this month ordering most civil litigation suspended until at least November or until the shutdown ends.
The appellate judges now mulling Monday’s arguments did not say when they expect to issue a decision.
Fisher and Smith are both senior judges and Bush appointees, while the third judge on the panel, L. Felipe Restrepo, is an Obama appointee. Observers expect the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo via President Donald Trump/Truth Social)Lethal U.S. military airstrikes on suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea have congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from Washington state raising concerns.
The latest attack, announced Sunday, is the seventh known strike since the Trump administration began the campaign in September. It killed three men. In total, the administration has acknowledged killing more than 30 people in the strikes.
U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, and freshman U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, both say Congress should have more oversight of the attacks.
“I don’t have a problem with drug smugglers being sent to the bottom of the ocean,” Baumgartner said during a call with reporters on Sunday. “I do have concerns about the process.”
Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, wants House Speaker Mike Johnson to call the chamber back into session during the ongoing government shutdown for a hearing on the strikes.
“President Trump and his Administration continue to fail to answer pressing questions regarding the President’s orders to carry out lethal U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea,” Smith said in a statement. 
“They have failed to demonstrate the legality of these strikes, provide transparency on the process used, or even a list of cartels that have been designated as terrorist organizations,” he added.
Baumgartner, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said “Congress does need to be involved when military action is taken.” 
“I’ll be looking forward to getting updates from the White House and when we do return to D.C.,” he said, “to see what is the plan and what the authorization is.”
Baumgartner’s comments are a rare, albeit mild, rebuke of Trump administration policies from a congressional Republican. 
Republican leadership in the Senate this month turned down a Democrat-backed measure to require congressional authorization for the strikes. Republican Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, signaled support for the resolution. 
The U.S. military in recent weeks has destroyed boats the White House suspects are being used by cartels to smuggle drugs from South America to the United States.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro recently accused the U.S. military of killing an innocent civilian in one of the incidents. Trump responded by saying he would cut off foreign aid to the country.
The Trump administration sent two survivors of a strike last week back to their home countries — Colombia and Ecuador — instead of prosecuting or detaining them. 
The White House says the United States is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels to justify killing the alleged traffickers, instead of arresting them. Legal experts have widely disputed this rationale. 
Meanwhile, the military leader overseeing the boat strikes announced last week he was stepping down less than a year into his tenure as head of the U.S. Southern Command. It was unclear if Adm. Alvin Holsey’s decision was tied to friction with the White House over the attacks.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Department of Justice has fined Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives and the lone Democrat on the Executive Council for campaign finance violations, according to cease-and-desist letters sent Friday.
The DOJ sent letters to Republican House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, Deputy Majority House Leader Joe Sweeney, and the Committee to Elect House Republicans Friday evening. The letters accused the four of violating state laws that regulate how candidates for elected office can spend their money and how that money must be reported.
Osborne
In its letter to Osborne, who represents Auburn in the House, the DOJ told the state representative he and his candidate committee filed its 2022 campaign finance reports over 33 months late. For the 2024 election cycle, the DOJ said Osborne’s committee finance reports were 10 months late. It fined Osborne and his committee $2,000 over the matter.
The DOJ is also fining the Committee to Elect House Republicans, of which Osborne is chair, $1,500. The letter from the DOJ, addressed to Osborne and another House Republican, Jim Kofalt, who serves as the committee’s treasurer, said that as of January — when it first alerted the committee — roughly $68,000 was unaccounted for in the organization’s 2024 election cycle reports. Additionally, roughly $15,000 was unaccounted for in reports related to a special election in 2023 and $86,000 was unaccounted for in the 2022 election cycle reports, per the letter. It also said the committee didn’t file one of the required reports for the 2022 election cycle and had errors in its December 2022 report. However, the committee was able to reconcile these issues in the reports by hiring an accountant, the DOJ said. Still, this fix was too late in the DOJ’s eyes.
“Although this Office appreciates that CTEHR voluntarily and diligently worked to correct the issues with its campaign finance filings, CTEHR’s initial failure to timely and accurately report its receipts and expenditures during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles deprived the public of this information when it mattered most — during and immediately after the 2022 and 2024 election cycles,” the DOJ wrote in its letter. 
Liot Hill
In its letter to Liot Hill, the DOJ said she inadvertently used campaign funds from her campaign committee on personal purchases — including cleaning her home after campaign events, clothes she wore during campaign events, and her car registration, all things she said she believed were legal campaign expenses but were not — during the 2024 election cycle. And although she corrected that by reimbursing her campaign committee with her own money after the DOJ notified her of the error in December, she failed to correct the campaign finance reports in time, which constitutes a violation. Additionally, Liot Hill and her committee have yet to file two required campaign finance reports, the DOJ said. The DOJ is ordering her to pay a $1,000 fine for the violations. Liot Hill is a Democrat who represents communities including Lebanon, Concord, Littleton, Peterborough, and Hinsdale on New Hampshire’s Executive Council.
“This office recognizes that this was your first campaign for statewide office,” the letter read. “This Office further recognizes that you promptly and willingly agreed to reimburse your campaign for all improper expenditures. However, you chose to run for executive council and to accept more than $100,000 in campaign contributions. Those decisions created an obligation for you to familiarize yourself with campaign finance requirements.”
Sweeney
The DOJ also fined a political action committee run by Sweeney, who represents Salem in the House and serves on the Salem Town Council, $500. The DOJ said the PAC Granite Solutions did not file all its required campaign finance reports during the 2024 election cycle, including a 48-hour expenditure report related to a mailer. After the DOJ initially notified Granite Solutions of its missing reports in February, the PAC promptly corrected the omissions, the DOJ said. Still, because it was late, the DOJ is fining Granite Solutions.

The UW-Platteville Baraboo Sauk County is set to close after a steep decline in enrollment. The two-year campus hit an enrollment peak in 2000 with 758 students. Enrollment on the campus hit an all time low this semester with 116 students. 
Baraboo Sauk County is the eighth branch campus to be closed or dramatically downsized since 2023. It is also the second branch campus under the management of UW-Platteville to be shut down after the campus in Richland County was shuttered in July 2023. 
“This decision was not made lightly,” UW-Platteville Chancellor Tammy Evetovich said in the announcement Friday. “Enrollment continues to decline on that campus, and we are committed to being good partners with the city and county by ensuring the campus can be used in ways that best serve the region.”
Enrollment on UW’s branch campuses has steadily declined in recent years, however campus faculty and staff, as well as residents of affected communities, have blamed UW administration officials for decades of decision making that deprioritized maintaining the two-year campuses. 
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) blamed the closures on Republican budget decisions.
“Campus closures and the march towards consolidation is a result of Republican politicians viewing higher education as a luxury good that only those who can afford it deserve,” she said in a statement. “In their view, UW is just another cost preventing them from giving more public money to their billionaire campaign backers. The ‘budget shortfalls’ that led to this closure were manufactured over the last 15 years by right-wing politicians who systematically divested from public higher education while strangling UW’s ability to manage its own financial affairs.”

(Screenshot of campaign ad)Businessman Will Martin launched his campaign for lieutenant governor Monday, joining a growing field for the second-highest executive office in Wisconsin.
Martin called himself a “common-sense conservative” in his launch ad, saying there is a “quiet crisis” of young people leaving the state. This is Martin’s second campaign for the office. He came in fifth in the 2022 primary when former U.S. Rep. Roger Roth was the Republican nominee.
“Wisconsin jobs are being lost. AI and automation are disrupting entire industries, and for far too many, homeownership has become a distant, if not impossible dream,” Martin said. “As lieutenant governor, I’ll work to cut the size and cost of state government and restore the promise of the American Dream together. Let’s ignite a new era of freedom, opportunity, and prosperity from Kenosha to Cornucopia.”
Martin worked in the administrations of former Govs. Tommy Thompson and Scott Walker. Under the Walker administration, he worked in the Wisconsin Housing & Economic Development Authority and the Department of Workforce Development.
Martin joins Former Lancaster Mayor David Varnam, who launched his campaign in September, in the race. Varnam also ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, coming seventh in the primary.
“I am concerned about my family’s future and the path Democrats are taking Wisconsin down,” Varnam said in his announcement. “We need to lower taxes to keep retirees, young people, and businesses in Wisconsin. Our schools need to focus on raising standards, test scores, and expectations for our students. As a father of two daughters, I will fight to keep men out of women’s sports and protect their locker rooms.”
Wisconsinites will cast their votes separately for governor and lieutenant governor during the partisan primary next year. The winners of the primaries will run on the same ticket in November and voters choose them as a pair.
The partisan primary is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026.
Republican candidates for governor include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann.
Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat, launched her campaign for lieutenant governor in August.

Oct. 14, 2025 | ScreenshotThe Michigan Court of Appeals has denied a writ of habeas corpus for seven chimpanzees currently at the DeYoung Family Zoo in Wallace, Mich., affirming a decision from the trial court that chimpanzees are not ‘persons’ under the law. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project, who are representing the chimpanzees, had been seeking a court order to show the merits of the case — but the appeals court judges called that argument “unpersuasive.”
“On the face of the complaint, the chimpanzees at defendants’ zoo are not eligible for habeas relief,” the decision read. “The chimpanzees are animals, and as the common law authorities all make clear, animals—including wild animals, such as these chimpanzees—are treated as property.  No exception exists for ‘intelligent’ animals, which in any event has no natural stopping point.”
The question of that “stopping point” was a central point in a hearing for the case last week, in which judges questioned the argument of lawyer Jake Davis that autonomy should be the defining line of which beings have a right to habeas corpus.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The lawyers for the chimpanzees issued a statement criticizing this decision, writing, “The Nonhuman Rights Project is deeply troubled that the Michigan Court of Appeals declined to protect autonomy—a supreme value under Michigan law—when the autonomous beings are chimpanzees.”
“While the decision properly treated the issue of nonhuman eligibility for habeas corpus relief as one for judges to consider under the common law, the Court of Appeals held that it was bound by 19th-century Michigan Supreme Court precedent treating animals as mere property,” the statement continued. “The chimpanzees confined in the DeYoung Family Zoo deserve the law’s protection because they are autonomous beings whose suffering matters.”

In the hearing, Judge Brock Swartzle, the presiding judge, referenced the Nonhuman Rights Project brief’s argument that the case of the chimpanzees was analogous to issues around the rights of women and enslaved people. 
In the decision, the judges specifically pushed back on that argument. 
“Plaintiff’s analogies to habeas proceedings involving women or enslaved persons do not alter this landscape,” the court’s opinion reads. “Those episodes reflect failures to honor human personhood, not expansions of it beyond the human species.”
The Nonhuman Rights Project added in their statement that they plan to send the case to the Michigan Supreme Court, asking them to “reject this outdated classification.” 
The appellate court’s conclusion noted that “only our Supreme Court may revise that common law principle,” though they added that “plaintiff’s argument for doing so is in any event substantively unpersuasive.”

“Our doors are open,” said Peter Hadler, deputy commissioner at the state Department of Social Services, which manages SNAP in Connecticut. “We’re talking to everyone who’s concerned about this.”
Hadler spoke at a press conference at The Grocery on Broad Street in Hartford with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and others.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Connecticut legislature have the ability to temporarily fund SNAP from state funds. The legislative leaders are planning a special session mid-November to put last fiscal year’s state budget surplus towards offsetting cuts to various assistance programs.
It costs $72 million monthly to fund SNAP in Connecticut.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, is a federal program. Blumenthal and nutrition program leaders urged an end to the shutdown.
During the last government shutdown, almost seven years ago, the USDA paid some benefits early to bridge a gap. This time around, the USDA told states that funds will be depleted come November.
Blumenthal said he has talked with Lamont and believes “he cares deeply about this issue.”
Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, which runs the state’s food banks, said his colleagues in other states are “jealous” of how the Connecticut government has been working with Connecticut Foodshare to address the possible funding gap. If SNAP funding runs out, many recipients will head to food banks, which Jakubowski said will not be able to serve everyone.
“We are here in a state in which the state government is actually interested in figuring out, how do we help people? That’s not a conversation that’s happening in every state,” Jakubowski said.
Two weeks ago, Lamont announced the state would cover the funding lapse of a different food program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC. The program provides food for young children and nursing or pregnant women. But WIC is smaller and cheaper than SNAP: it costs about $6 million each month in Connecticut and serves around 52,000 people in the state.
The shutdown began when Democrats refused to support the GOP funding bill because it lets Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies expire. Now, the two parties are fighting a messaging battle to convince Americans the other is responsible for the shutdown.
“If it isn’t addressed today, people won’t know whether they can afford health insurance, and they won’t buy it,” Blumenthal said. “So our leverage here is that we will insist that the health care tax credit be extended.”
He added that he sees the fight as about human rights, not politics.
When pressed about what might jump-start progress in Washington, Blumenthal said he saw “energy and momentum” at anti-Trump No Kings protests over the weekend.
He said he is having bipartisan conversations in Washington but his Republican colleagues don’t want those conversations to be publicly known for fear of angering the White House. He blamed House Republicans and speaker Mike Johnson for being “out of town and out of touch” and continuing the shutdown.
Democrats across the country have argued that the shutdown is about fighting for health care, and that Republicans are at fault because they control Congress and the White House. Blumenthal was on-message on Monday.
“The White House and both houses of Congress are under their control. There are limits to what we can do,” he said.
He added it was “myth and misinformation” that undocumented immigrants receive SNAP benefits, a point some Republican lawmakers have used against the program.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9945-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 16:17:12.296846

HOST: Hallie Claflin
GUEST: Mayor Dominick Pangallo 







IF YOU WALK DOWN the crowded streets of Salem in October, you’ll come face to face – literally – with witches, goblins, ghosts, and a whole lot of tourists. The small coastal city of 45,000 is just eight square miles, with downtown and waterfront areas representing only a fraction of that area. Yet a love of history and Halloween tradition brought more than a million visitors to the witch city last year in the month of October alone, breaking a record.  
To the delight of local businesses and often the dismay of downtown residents, Salem has something other Gateway Cities don’t: a thriving seasonal tourism economy. But its tourism boom in recent decades has been met with contempt from many local residents who struggle to leave their homes amid the October crowds and heavy traffic. And the tourism season is only getting longer.  
But no spell or magic can stop the visitors from coming, meaning the city has to step up.  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon’s Gateway Cities reporter Hallie Claflin interviews Mayor Dominick Pangallo of Salem.  
“Our October preparation happens all year long. We start November 1,” Pangallo said. “We have about three and a half to four million tourists come to Salem every year, but to have a million of them coming in one month is definitely a significant endeavor for us to be able to manage that.”  
Pangallo explains that while essential to the local economy, the tourism boom isn’t as lucrative as some may think. He says the city spent close to $640,000 last year preparing for the flock of October tourists, most of which is spent on increased police presence and public works like barricades, portable restrooms, trash receptacles, and more. 
The city brought in about $700,000 in revenues last October, not including its meals and lodging tax, which is reported quarterly instead of monthly and totaled $1.5 million in the quarter that included October last year. It’s a small amount when compared to the city’s more than $200 million annual budget.  
“It’s helpful, but it’s not the largest source of revenue supporting city services by any means,” Pangallo said. “But it helps support the services that we especially need to be able to provide in October.”  
Pangallo pointed to a bill proposed by Gov. Maura Healey that would give municipalities the option to increase their local tax on meals and lodging. He says the city already meets the maximum limit set for both and adjusting it upward could help shift the city’s cost burdens onto the tourists who directly benefit from the services. 
For local businesses, tourism is lucrative, generating around $140 million in direct spending alone, Pangallo said.   
The tourism industry represents about 1200 jobs in Salem, which is just four percent of the local labor force, Pangallo said. But because of the visitor economy, the city enjoys a 98 percent storefront occupancy rate in the downtown and waterfront areas. But there are a handful of those that don’t benefit from the Halloween buzz.  
“Not every business in our downtown is connected to the tourism industry, so when October comes around, some of those places have a hard time with the regulars being able to get in and get a haircut or pick up something at the store,” Pangallo said.  
On the episode, Pangallo discusses how the city plans for the October influx (3:00), how lucrative the visitor economy truly is (7:49), and a pending state policy change that would benefit Salem (21:09).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

The Fairhope Police Department said in court documents that they received a complaint about the costume. In a statement posted to Facebook on Monday, the department said an officer “observed an individual in a phallic costume near the Baldwin Square Shopping Center.”

“The officer approached the woman and requested that she remove the costume, which is deemed obscene in a public setting; however, she refused to comply,” the statement said.
The rally was one of  over a dozen protests happening in the state on Saturday. The protests were peaceful with no major incidents reported. 
A message seeking additional comment was left with the Fairhope Police Department Monday. Attempts to find contact information for Gamble were not immediately successful. 
Johnston Tisdale, director of Indivisible Baldwin County, the organization that sponsored the protest, said in a statement Monday Gamble’s arrest violates the First Amendment.

“Ms. Gamble was peacefully expressing her point of view on Saturday.

Their complete failure to do so in this situation runs against the free expression values that created the city of Fairhope and against the liberty guarantees enshrined in Alabama law and the United States Constitution.
Resisting arrest is Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of $3,000. Disorderly conduct is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail and a fine of $500.

The Supreme Court put Eshelman’s failed lawsuit, “Iron Bar Holdings, LLC v. Cape, Bradly H., Et al.,” on its list of rejected appeals, which the court published Monday morning. The order ends a five-year fight that pitted the public’s right to access public land against private property rights.
Bradly Cape and three hunting friends corner crossed — stepping from one piece of public land to another where the two intersected with two pieces of Eshelman’s private ranch — momentarily passing through the airspace above Eshelman’s property. Even though the Missouri men never set foot on his land, Eshelman sued them for trespassing.
The hunter’s attorney, Ryan Semerad, said the Supreme Court affirmed centuries-old tradition and laws that public land is held in trust by the government for all Americans. The ruling applies to 2.44 million acres in Wyoming alone.
“That means something,” he said of the trust principle. “That’s real, it’s sturdy. We’re just thrilled.”
“Where you have checkerboarded land and there are public parcels that are only accessible by corner crossing [and] the only way to get to it is at its section corners, the private landowners can’t stop you.” Ryan Semerad
“Awesome,” was Cape’s reaction. “We never thought one time that we were doing something wrong.”
Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl had sided with the hunters in the first ruling on the federal civil suit. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals backed Skavdahl and Eshelman appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. A Carbon County jury had previously found the hunters not guilty of criminal trespass in Carbon County Circuit Court. 
The case grew out of southern Wyoming, where land ownership resembles a checkerboard of alternating square-mile sections of public and private property.
“Where you have checkerboarded land and there are public parcels that are only accessible by corner crossing [and] the only way to get to it is at its section corners, the private landowners can’t stop you,” Semerad said. “They can’t call the sheriff. They can’t sue you for trespass as long as you don’t touch or damage their property.”
1885 law
Eshelman’s lead attorney, R. Reeves Anderson, said he was not authorized to comment following the Supreme Court’s decision not to take up the case. Eshelman, a North Carolina resident, couldn’t be immediately reached.
The hunters’ legal arguments relied on the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act, which prohibits blocking public access to public land, including by fencing and using threats and intimidation. Some landowners, law officers, agencies and agriculture groups have interpreted various corner-crossing cases to insist that corner crossing is trespassing.
In a criminal case separate from Eshelman’s civil suit, the Carbon County attorney, at Eshelman’s insistence, in 2021 charged Cape, Philip Yoemans, Zach Smith and John Slowensky with misdemeanor criminal trespass.
Three of the hunters corner crossed to reach public land surrounded by Eshelman’s 20,000-acre-plus Elk Mountain Ranch in 2020. All four corner crossed to hunt on wildlife-rich Elk Mountain in 2021.
A six-person Carbon County jury found them not guilty in 2022, returning a verdict in less time than it took a hungry reporter to order and consume a quickly made taco salad from Rose’s Lariat café in Rawlins.

The Supreme Court decision today was almost as swift and certain. It filed the order without comment or dissent.
“It’s just an immediate sign they have reviewed the matter in as short a window as possible,” Semerad said of the Supreme Court. “They looked at it and said, ‘We don’t need to do anything here,’ at least that’s my interpretation.”
The order spans the 10th Circuit’s jurisdiction across Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. Had the Supreme Court heard the case, whatever decision it reached would have applied across all 50 states.
Mixed feelings
Cape said he was torn over whether it would have been better for the Supreme Court to take the case and expand the 10th Circuit decision across the country — an uncertain proposition — or settle for what he, his companions and the rest of the country won in the 10th Circuit. Semerad, too, said he had mixed feelings.
“There’s just this little nugget in me that’s like, I wanted to go do the fight,” he said of the now-disappeared prospect of arguing the case in front of nine justices. “But that is totally personal. I just wanted to throw some more punches.”
“But for now, this is where the book closes.”

Cape and friends had been hunting in Wyoming the year before they first corner crossed. They stumbled across Elk Mountain and talking to nearby ranchers they learned it was thick with elk to the point neighbors had to protect their haystacks from the herd.
Eshelman, they were told, didn’t allow the general public to hunt on his ranch or to corner cross to reach public land enmeshed in his holdings. By blocking corner crossing, Eshelman reaped for himself the bounty of property belonging to all Americans, the hunters contended.
Cape did some research and found a real estate agent’s listing for the ranch around the time Eshelman bought it in 2005. That listing described the ranch as consisting of both private and public property, amounting to 50 square miles or about 32,000 acres.
The ranch on the 11,156-foot-high Elk Mountain was listed for $19.9 million at the time. Court rulings, the listing stated, give the ranch owner exclusive access to the enmeshed public land.
“Reading that is first what got me to looking into such a thing,” Cape said of corner crossing. “It just didn’t make sense to me,” he said of the notion that corner crossing was illegal.
The legal case Cape found, a 1970s saga known as Leo Sheep, dealt with the construction of a road, also in Carbon County, across a common checkerboard corner. The Supreme Court said the government did not have the right to build a road that invaded private property.
Fence builder
Cape owns the All-Type Fence company in Cuba, Missouri and knows something about property lines, he said.
“All I wanted to do was walk and hike and hunt and cross the corners,” he said. “So that [Leo Sheep] case didn’t have any relevance [to] me. I kind of realized what was going on, that it [the real estate listing and similar claims] was just propaganda trying to keep people out.”
He briefed his hunting buddies — a high school music teacher, a mechanic and an employee at his company.
“Once I found this [Leo Sheep case] and figured this out kind of on my own and then relayed that information to them, they never doubted me,” he said. “They were good to go.”
Cape credited Semerad and fellow attorney Lee Mickus, the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and others. Backcountry Hunters raised funds to wrangle the case through the courts for five years, ensuring the men had the funding necessary to stand and fight in court.
Eshelman is a wealthy pharmaceutical magnate, a significant political donor to conservative causes and a philanthropist who’s given millions to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. He’s also a hunter and conservationist who placed significant development restrictions on thousands of acres of private ranch land that he bought and sold around Elk Mountain.
Backcountry Hunters’ fundraising got a boost when Steven Rinella, an author, hunter, conservationist and television personality who founded The Meateater, featured the corning crossing saga in his broadcasts.
“Our money, like doubled overnight,” Cape said. “So it was pretty easy to see early on that the support that we had was incredible.”
Also incredible, Cape said, is what he learned.
“It’s just one of those life journeys that you don’t suspect,” he said. “You learn all kinds of stuff about the legal system.
“I didn’t realize … there was that much propaganda built up, selfishness.” Cape said. Landowners “just kind of made that stuff up as they went along,” he said, something that was “kind of shocking to me.”
Semerad looked ahead. “It’s a solid foundation upon which to think about how to orient your life,” he said. “There’s going to be bad actors who have their own intentions, who want to treat these public resources — like our public lands — as a private kingdom.
“But every time they do that, they are cutting against American tradition and history, and they’re going to lose and there’s going to be a way to beat them.”

The board has postponed a decision and plant to get more input.,"For over four hours, a standing-room-only crowd of residents watched as opponents and proponents of a planned asphalt plant pleaded their cases at a Lafayette County Board of Supervisors meeting. 
After the hearing, the board unanimously voted to table a decision on rezoning a property in the town of Taylor from agricultural to heavy industrial use to allow development of the plant. 
“We feel like that we need more time,” said Supervisor John Morgan, citing new information presented by both sides and a need for additional time for written statements to be submitted.
“You’re determining the fate of our regenerative farm operation and our livelihood,” said Ley Falkner, whose family lives on and runs Falkner Farms across from the proposed plant. 
The Falkner family, their representatives and the bevy of supporters argued that the plant poses a significant environmental and health risk to residents and is anathema to the county’s existing zoning plan. 
J.W. McCurdy, the plant developer and owner of the proposed site, and other proponents made the case that there’s a need for a new asphalt plant to accommodate Oxford’s growth. They said it would create jobs and economic development and tried to assure the board that there is minimal environmental risk.
One of the central questions around the rezoning is whether Taylor and Lafayette County have changed enough to justify rezoning. Both sides presented letters from experts ranging from city planners to university professors about the risks and benefits of the proposed plant.
“I am respectfully asking you to consider the agricultural impact the zoning change could have, not only with respect to the land, but also to local food production,” wrote Andy Gipson, state agriculture commissioner and gubernatorial candidate, in a letter to the board.
Emotions ran high in the packed meeting room, with most of the public’s comments being against the plant. One woman was escorted out of the building by a member of the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department.
“That’s unfair, you gave (Mccurdy) 40 minutes,” said Elizabeth Falkner of Falkner Farms in response to her being cut off after five minutes while addressing the board. The crowd applauded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20134425/img_7740_720.jpg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas.
Last month, ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, submitted an $86.1 million bid for the two hospitals. Prospect did not receive any additional bids for the hospitals, court records show. The company originally paid $105 million when it purchased the two facilities in 2016. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, said the health system looks forward to the “opportunity to stabilize and expand the workforce at these hospitals, provide support to enhance quality and safety, and advance strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities and community partners.”
“Every hospital that has joined Hartford HealthCare has experienced measurable positive results that benefit patients — including across-the-board top safety ratings, improved access to care close to home, leading-edge technology and the recruitment of world-class clinicians,” Varona wrote in an emailed statement.
Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to a request for comment.
The deal still needs to obtain state approval, known as the “certificate of need,” overseen by the Office of Health Strategy. OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time required to approve a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
That deal also became mired in legal disputes, with Yale New Haven and Prospect suing and countersuing each other over the true value of the hospitals. The parties recently settled, with Yale New Haven agreeing to pay Prospect $45 million to exit the deal and end all pending litigation.
During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete, Boyd Jackson, OHS’s director of legislation and regulation, said in an emailed statement.
The acquisition of Manchester Memorial and Rockville General would further expand the footprint of one of Connecticut’s largest health systems.
Hartford HealthCare currently owns seven hospitals across the state, the most of any health system in Connecticut, and earned roughly $6 billion in revenue in 2023. By comparison, Yale New Haven Health had higher revenue in 2023, $6.4 billion, but owns only four hospitals.
The announcement of Hartford HealthCare’s success marks the latest ownership development for Prospect’s three hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital.
The state plans to acquire Waterbury Hospital as part of a broader plan to expand its own struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The state is also in talks to acquire two independent hospitals, Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam and Bristol Hospital. 
Officials hope the acquisitions will help boost the competitiveness of UConn Health in the world of academic medical institutions, as well as push the health system towards the ultimate goal of achieving financial sustainability for its clinical operations, so that it no longer has to rely on support from the state. 
The state is also seeking to borrow $390 million to fund the expansion project. The funding would primarily go towards capital improvement projects at all three hospitals, though it would also support the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital, state Comptroller Sean Scanlon said in a previous interview with the CT Mirror. 
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 20.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.
When regulated utilities want to hike customer bills, they go to the commission for permission. The IURC can also regulate construction projects, asset acquisition, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans, service territories and more.
Braun has suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.
“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters last month, after opening IURC applications. He called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”
Braun wants new appointees to focus on ratepayers, affordability and supply.
The commission can’t have more than three members of the same party, according to Indiana Code. Braun, a Republican, will fill two GOP openings and one Democratic vacancy. He’ll also have to choose who will chair the agency.
The jobs come with salaries of $152,000.
The 12 Republican finalists are:

Alfonso Vidal, a southern Indiana businessman
Andy Zay, who has served portions of northeast Indiana in the state Senate since 2016
Anthony Swinger, a 25-year employee of the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor
William Herrick, president of Midwest Energy Partners LLC

The bill cuts 20 percent of funding […]","THE RECENT REPUBLICAN megabill, H.R.1, slashed the largest amount from basic needs programs in American history to give tax breaks to the wealthy. The bill cuts 20 percent of funding from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – a basic needs program that serves 1 in 6 very low-income Massachusetts residents. Eligibility restrictions in H.R.1 threaten benefits for around 110,000 current Massachusetts recipients, including families with children, older adults, veterans, and homeless households. In Greater Boston alone, Boston Indicators estimates about 40,000 very low-income adults could lose benefits.  
However, to echo Gov. Healey: “In Massachusetts, we won’t accept that.” The Commonwealth has the expertise, the resources, and the moral commitment to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. Our leaders must act decisively to combat the harms of the bill by investing in systemic solutions that ensure residents with the lowest incomes can put food on the table.  
Doing this requires investing in the state’s SNAP agency – the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) – to make sure eligible families can readily connect to SNAP.  
Massachusetts has done much to bring SNAP to homes that need it, such as allowing people to apply for SNAP at the same time they apply for MassHealth, the state Medicaid program. This, in addition to need intensified by the pandemic and high food costs, has contributed to a 45 percent caseload increase since March 2020. But DTA staffing has not kept pace with the increase. Pre-pandemic DTA data show the ratio of SNAP cases per SNAP worker as about 900 to 1. Now, it’s 1,300 to 1 — nearly 50 percent higher.  
The consequences of this imbalance are clear: Right now, nearly three of every four calls seeking help from a SNAP worker don’t get through because DTA doesn’t have enough staff to respond. Accuracy suffers – when DTA workers can’t talk to everyone who calls, they don’t get information they need to keep case information up to date. Overburdened workers also make more mistakes, burn out, and struggle to provide efficient customer service. We see this in the data. Since August 2024 the total number of people receiving SNAP has been notching down – even though severe food insecurity has been going up – in part because people cannot get access to the help they desperately need. 
We commend the governor for committing to level funding DTA case workers in the immediate term – but in the post H.R.1 world, we must go further to invest in SNAP. For example, we should tap into the Commonwealth’s rainy day fund to alleviate the existing and potential harm to recipients and increased state costs expected in the next few years. This includes making sure DTA has enough staff to enroll all eligible Massachusetts families and minimize mistakes.  
Even before the bill’s cuts, SNAP was not enough to meet the cost of a meal in any Massachusetts county. We know our colleagues in the emergency food delivery system do heroic work each day trying to address gaps. We have also seen great examples of philanthropic institutions, like the Boston Foundation, coming forward to help alleviate the cruelty and shortsightedness of the president’s legislation.  
But philanthropy can’t fully replace what food assistance programs offer. SNAP alone brings $2.6 billion in federal aid to the Commonwealth each year, accounting for $1 of every $5 spent at grocery stores in Massachusetts. While H.R. 1 may pass a percentage of those costs to Massachusetts (as much as 15 percent) based on the state’s effectiveness at delivering benefits, even at the highest rate, the cost share is a burden worth bearing. Any policy reducing SNAP eligibility in Massachusetts would likely not only hurt local businesses, it would also worsen health outcomes, increase health care costs, force residents to go hungry, and harm other programs like the Commonwealth’s universal school meal program. 
In this environment, strengthening and improving the efficiency of the DTA is an economic and moral imperative. We look forward to working with Gov. Healey, our Legislature, and partners to chart a path forward in Massachusetts that expands SNAP’s reach and fully harnesses the most efficient, impactful, and cost-effective program we have to reduce hunger and poverty.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Supreme Court's video)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court has approved a framework for virtual proceedings, extending pandemic-era approaches after hearing mixed opinions from judges and attorneys.
The court filed an order Tuesday with the Kansas Court of Appeals that urges district judges to consider accepting remote hearings or remote appearances in certain circumstances to improve efficiency and access to justice.
Remote proceedings were used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but since public and private spaces resumed typical gathering practices, it has been up to judges across Kansas how they want to use the technology in their courtrooms.
Kansas has lagged behind most other states. But the exception has been for criminal defendants in jail, who make early and brief appearances in court via video conference. Other states left the remote rules created during the pandemic in place or expanded them to allow remote appearings for a variety of hearings.
The Kansas Supreme Court outlined in the rule guidelines for judges in deciding whether to allow a remote hearing or appearance. Among them: If all parties agree, a proceeding is preliminary or for scheduling purposes, the time and expense of traveling for an in-person proceeding outweighs the benefits, a remote proceeding would increase access to the court or address an attorney shortage, or a person involved in the case expresses health concerns about attending in-person.
The rule attempts to balance concerns from some judges, who want to retain the discretion to decide whether remote proceedings happen in their courtrooms, and warnings from attorneys that requiring in-person hearings harms defendants and exacerbates the state’s attorney shortage.
Nearly 80% of Kansas attorneys live in five counties that contain about half of the state’s population: Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte. The rest of the state is underrepresented, according to data from the American Bar Association.
Judges would retain discretion to deny a party’s request for a remote appearance under the rule, particularly if the request is untimely or if remote proceedings “would undermine the integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding, such as when highly sensitive, particularly dense, or exhibit-heavy testimony is expected,” the rule said. A court must not hold a remote proceeding if it could threaten or violate a person’s rights under the Kansas and U.S. constitutions, privileged attorney-client communications are made difficult, public access is restricted, it interferes with a court’s ability to produce an accurate record, or a party or the court cannot access technology needed.
Acting Chief Justice Eric Rosen said in a Tuesday news release that remote hearings will, at times, promote efficiency,” just as there will be times when an in-person proceeding is absolutely essential to be fair and effective.”
He added: “Every case has its own set of facts and circumstances, so it was paramount the rule created a clear framework for someone to make a request while retaining a judge’s discretion whether to grant or deny the request.”
The final version of the rule included changes from the draft distributed for public comment in July, including adjusted wording to emphasize the discretion afforded judges. The following sentence was also added: “This rule does not provide any grounds for appellate review beyond existing statutory or constitutional law.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Supreme-Court-chamber.png,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan’s attorney general has joined several states in filing a friend of the court brief supporting the student-led campus newspaper of Stanford University, which sued the administration of President Donald Trump over its ideological deportation policy.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced her involvement with the brief on Monday, filed by 20 state attorneys general in Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation v. Rubo. The lawsuit was initiated by The Stanford Daily in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, citing the Trump administration as targeting and punishing noncitizens with lawful status.
In the context of the student newspaper, The Stanford Daily notes that college students and faculty were particularly vulnerable to the administration’s immigration enforcement if they expressed political beliefs that did not align with Trump’s White House.
“Taking away student visas because of someone’s political opinions is an embarrassing and unconstitutional stance for this administration to take,” Nessel said in a statement. “Michigan is home to dozens of incredible colleges and universities that attract students and faculty from across the world. Actions like this don’t just silence debate on campus – they threaten everyone’s First Amendment rights by discouraging open discussion and the exchange of ideas. I join my colleagues in urging the court to uphold the right to freedom of speech.”
The lawsuit specifically targets two Trump executive orders – EO 14161 and EO 14188 – both of which laid the groundwork for the ideological deportation policy. The orders allow federal law enforcement and other agencies to investigate, detain and deport noncitizen students and faculty engaging in constitutionally protected political speech. The Stanford Daily argues the practice is causing a chilling effect among international student journalists, who have declined assignments, removed their bylines or resigned out of fear that their reporting could be grounds for their deportations.
Nessel and the other attorneys general filing the brief said that Trump’s use of ideology in this context was unlawful, and threatens the economic vitality, public health and safety of affected states. The harms also include detriments to the overall purpose of higher education.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts recently addressed the policy in American Association of University Professors v. Rubio, which ruled that First Amendment protections apply to citizens and lawfully present noncitizens.

Beverly Chester-Burton, D-Shively, speaking during a legislative committee meeting, Jan. 18, 2024. (LRC Public Information)Kentucky Democratic Rep. Beverly Chester-Burton has been placed on home incarceration following her arrest in 2024 for driving under the influence. 
Chester-Burton, from Shively, agreed to an Alford plea to driving under the influence on Oct. 15. According to Jefferson County District Court records, the state lawmaker was sentenced to 10 days on home incarceration. A charge of reckless driving was dismissed. 
Chester-Burton also received a work release stipulation, meaning she can still attend legislative meetings in Frankfort amid home incarceration. 
Her attorney, Krsna Tibbs, did not immediately return a request for comment from the Kentucky Lantern Monday. However, Tibbs told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Chester-Burton “took an Alford plea on a DUI with the condition of alcohol treatment.” He said that such a plea “allows her to maintain her innocence but acknowledges that the prosecution could win based on her word versus the officer.” 
“She is not serving a jail sentence, and she has no restrictions and will meet all her legislative obligations in Frankfort as normal,” Tibbs told the newspaper. 
According to the arrest citation from last year, police officers were responding to a domestic violence call when Chester-Burton drove her vehicle into oncoming lanes of traffic and “sat there for a minute forcing an oncoming vehicle to pass around her in the opposite oncoming lane.” Chester-Burton then pulled into the correct lane, but stopped her vehicle in the middle of the road and put it into park. 
The citation said that officers approached Chester-Burton and reported a strong alcoholic odor coming from her. Chester-Burton told officers she was coming from Frankfort and “people were calling her and asking what was going on in Shively.” 
After she was arrested and being transported to jail, Chester-Burton “stated that ‘these guys act like they haven’t ever been to a birthday party,’” the report said. 
House Democratic Caucus leaders — Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, Caucus Chair Al Gentry and Whip Lindsey Burke — said in a statement Monday that public officials “are entrusted with the confidence of the people and must uphold the highest standards of conduct.” 
“Impaired driving endangers lives, and we take that responsibility seriously,” the caucus leaders said.
“We are committed to encouraging her to address any personal issues that may be impacting her life, her community, and her public service.”
Chester-Burton was previously arrested for a DUI in 2020 after falling asleep in a drive-through line at a White Castle while she was the mayor of Shively. 
Chester-Burton was elected to the House in 2023 and represents the 44th House District, which includes western parts of Jefferson County.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chester-burton011724-1024x702.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

(Photo by Maria Pemberton/CommonWealth Beacon)It was three months into the second presidential administration of Donald Trump when a small group of New England university administrators convened at a 1902 Beaux-Arts mansion owned by Boston University, just a few blocks from the main campus on an unobtrusive treelined side street in Brookline.
They filed into a high-ceilinged conference room in a one-time steel magnate’s estate turned events center, with huge picture windows overlooking the sleepy residential neighborhood. Representatives of the international student recruiting company that was hosting the meeting strategically positioned themselves at the entrances, handing out agendas.
The peace and quiet were a stark contrast to the growing chaos in the broader world outside. Billions of dollars of federal research funding for many of the universities where these administrators worked was being cut, and investigations and sanctions were being fired at them by the Trump administration. Soon budgets would be slashed, programs shut down, and employees laid off. This day-long event was about a group that seemed to be facing yet another threat — one with equally grave implications for these schools and the larger Massachusetts economy: international students.
Just days earlier, masked agents had arrested a Tufts University doctoral student on a street in Somerville and whisked her to a detention center in Louisiana. Thousands of student visas were being revoked. International students already admitted to U.S. universities faced a slowdown in appointments for required consular interviews and would soon be required to provide their social media histories. The administration would later try blocking Harvard from enrolling international students at all, limit the proportion other elite schools others could admit, restrict the time these students could stay in the country, and increase the cost of the follow-on visas many have historically used to remain and get jobs here.
A succession of speakers broached these topics at the conference, which was sponsored by the Norwegian international student recruiting company Keystone Education Group. Some triggered nervous laughter, and there were anxious whispers between sessions and over the buffet lunch, from which some attendees had to excuse themselves to take phone calls from colleagues helping international students worried they might also be detained or wouldn’t be allowed to return to the US if they went home for the summer.










I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world. Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.


– Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president


The message of the gathering was grim. The seemingly ceaseless flow of international students so critical to Massachusetts universities and colleges would almost certainly slow — probably dramatically.
“You cannot pretend that students from X countries are going to be coming to us in Y numbers anymore,” Vera Grek, director of graduate and international enrollment at Wentworth Institute of Technology, told the meeting.
That’s a $4 billion-a-year problem for Massachusetts alone, which ranks fourth among states  — after California, New York, and Texas  —  in the number of international students at its universities and colleges. More than 82,000 international students studied here last year, supporting an estimated 35,849 jobs.
But there was something else the officials in this room knew. The institutions that they represented largely had themselves to blame for becoming so financially dependent on international students. Many schools in Massachusetts recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else, federal data show, increasing their numbers year after year to help fill each successive class. That’s largely because of a demographic decline in the number of domestic students in the Northeast, and the comparatively high cost of higher education here, which makes it less appealing to American applicants from places in the country where the number of 18-year-olds is steady or rising.
While international students comprise less than 5% of total enrollment at US universities, they make up 35% at Northeastern University, 34% at Clark University and Babson College, 31% at MIT, 29% at Berklee College of Music, 27% at Brandeis University, and 26% at Harvard. Even onetime commuter schools like the Boston and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts state system have hugely increased their number of international students. International graduate students in particular proved so lucrative that, on one Massachusetts campus — Northeastern — they had come to make up more than two-thirds of graduate enrollment.
Yet as international students became increasingly essential, there were signs that fewer of them were coming, even before the turmoil of Trump’s second term. Global demand for American higher education had already started slipping under pressure from geopolitical tensions, increased competition, and concerns among prospective applicants about cost and safety. Fewer of the international students who were still coming could afford to pay full tuition. While the United States is still where the largest proportion of international students end up, its lead has been eroding, Keystone data show, In the fall before Trump’s reelection, the number of international graduate students and new undergraduates had already started to decline, according to the Institute for International Education, or IIE, threatening Massachusetts colleges’ reliance on them.
“I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world,” says Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president, who was also state commissioner of higher education from 2009 to 2015. “Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.”
That complacency now presents a potential multibillion-dollar hit to the economy, if international student flows further decline, as projections suggest they will. The number of international students arriving in the United States in August, before the start of this semester, was down nearly 20% compared to the same period last year, new figures show. International students don’t only help universities balance their books and inject dollars into the local economy by patronizing restaurants, buying cars, and renting off-campus apartments. They also create research that fuels business, fill jobs in knowledge industries, and create their own startups.
“The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot,” says JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an industry group. “People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.”

Massachusetts universities and colleges started doubling down on international student recruitment around 2011, when domestic enrollment began a long decline. Since then, the number of students overall has fallen by more than 14 percent, but the number of international undergraduates at Massachusetts colleges and universities jumped by about 20 percent, an analysis of federal data show. The number in graduate programs, which are big money makers for universities, nearly doubled.
University admissions offices employ designated international recruiters who spend months living out of suitcases as they travel across the globe to entice students. Some team up with schools that teach English to prospective applicants and with companies like Keystone, which works with 5,500 institutions in more than 190 countries. These recruiting agents generate leads from online inquiries and help students pick countries and schools, complete their applications, and find places to live. As an indication of how important international students have become, many universities pay commissions to these agents, according to the National Association of College Admissions Counselors.
However they recruit, there were plenty of signs, even before Trump, that it was becoming harder for US universities to enroll international students — especially those who could afford to pay full American tuition. Instead, the market has shifted away from China and the Middle East to students from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where many need financial aid. This means less revenue than in the past for the US universities they choose.
“The countries where [cost] is not a hurdle are flattening,” Anne Corriveau, BU’s director of international admissions, told the meeting at the mansion.
In 2023, the last year for which the figures are available by country, the number of international students from China fell by four percent after years of increases, the IIE reports. Numbers were also down from other more affluent nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Japan, and flat from Europe, but up from places in the world with less wealth, including Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ghana.
Meanwhile, there has been intensifying competition from other countries — notably Canada, Australia, and the UK, which last year surpassed the United States as a preferred destination, according to a 2024 Keystone survey. Interest in Italy and Spain is also up. Schools in these countries charge less, on average, than colleges in the United States, and generally make it easier for international students to stay and work when they graduate. Far higher proportions of prospective international students also say they feel more welcome and safe in those places than the United States, another Keystone survey of more than 41,000 students worldwide found in April — though two-thirds said their biggest concern about going to college in the US was the cost.
How vulnerable US universities and colleges were to their reliance on international students was laid bare by the pandemic, federal data show; the number fell by 72 percent in calendar year 2020 alone. The greatest decline was in the Northeast, which saw a drop of nearly 20 percent. Even before Trump returned to office, more than 40 percent of student visa applications to the United States last year were denied under the Biden administration, up from 15 percent 10 years ago.
The impact on enrollment of the Trump administration’s visa revocations and research funding cuts will take time to know conclusively. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, which represents international education professionals worldwide, projects based on available State Department data that the number of international students will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent this year nationwide with an estimated $7 billion economic hit. The association’s numbers suggest the Massachusetts economy will lose nearly $620 million — more than any other state except for California and New York. (Other estimates are less dire, an indication of how hard it is to track this, and of mistrust in federal data.) Even before the election, however, the enrollment of international students declined in two key nationwide measures. The number in graduate programs dropped by 2 percent last fall, or more than 10,000 enrollees, according to IIE, after years of increases and in spite of pent-up demand that accumulated during Covid. The number of first-time international undergraduates also fell by 5 percent.
“We often think about year-to-year enrollment, and really that’s not where we can see change. It’s about the slow erosion of what America represents,” says Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College who studies international shifts. “There are actually concerning trends that have been happening for years.”
Massachusetts universities prefer not to talk about this. Northeastern, for example, did not respond to repeated requests to for an interview. Most of the international student administrators at that Brookline conference wouldn’t go on the record. Another school, Gordon College, gave a response that has become typical across higher education. It “decided to pause on providing comment due to the deep sensitivity surrounding international students and ongoing current events,” a spokeswoman wrote.
All of this comes at a time when university enrollment overall is projected to decline further starting next year, as the number of 18-year-old prospective first-year students plummets – a product of the low birth rates coming out of the 2008 Great Recession called the “demographic cliff.” US high school graduates have also started going to college at lower rates, questioning the return on the investment.

A mile and a half from the Wightman Mansion, where university officials huddled to discuss international student enrollment, the smell of Korean barbecue wafted through a neighborhood of boba tea cafes, dumpling dives, ramen shops, and restaurants that sell malatang, a particularly spicy kind of hot pot. Young people balancing book bags and backpacks pedaled on Blue Bikes past storefronts advertising rental apartments. Others fidgeted with their phones while waiting for the 57 bus to Boston University. This bustling enclave in the student-packed Allston neighborhood of Boston is increasingly embracing its identity as a reminder of home for some of the tens of thousands of students who pour into Massachusetts from around the globe to go to college.
Upstairs at Stage Karaoke, a sleek space hung with video screens, LED lights, and lyrics projected in various languages, owner Alex Vichienrat says international students make up most of his business. Private, soundproofed VIP rooms encircle a communal main stage, where karaoke brings cultures together. “This is our melting pot space,” Vichienrat said. Without international students, he added, “this entire neighborhood would be gone.”
These more nuanced contributions of international students are often celebrated by advocates of international education. They’re also easy to see, in places such as Allston.
International students broaden the experience on campuses for everyone, says Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents public college and university faculty and staff.
“This is an increasingly interconnected, global world. We want to train our young people to understand the rest of the world,” Page says. Without international students, “you don’t get exposed to other people and their ideas and it can breed a narrowness of thinking. That would be a real loss, if that kind of thing was to stop.”










The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot.

You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.

Less evident are the long-term economic implications of what could happen here if international students stop coming.
The preponderance of international students in graduate programs isn’t entirely because of universities trying to meet revenue targets. It’s also because Americans are comparatively less well prepared for science, technology, and other fields. US students score lower than those in 36 other countries in math on the Program for International Student Assessment, a test  that measures how well 15-year-olds can solve real-life challenges using skills they’ve learned. Only one in five college-bound American high school students is equipped to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, or math, the National Science and Technology Council has found.
International students now earn nearly two-thirds of all master’s degrees from US universities in computer science and more than half in engineering. Two-thirds of graduate students in artificial intelligence at American universities are foreign born.
This portends another grim scenario for Massachusetts if the slide continues or accelerates in the number of international student numbers already under way: There will be fewer of them to work in or help start businesses in increasingly competitive industries. More foreign-born than native-born residents in Massachusetts have graduate degrees, and nearly three in 10 workers here in science, technology, engineering, or math come from other countries, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports immigration.

One bright spot — for US universities, if not for students — is that competing destinations have begun to impose their own restrictions. Canada has tightened international student caps. In Australia, the government failed in a proposal to put a limit on international students last year. But it increased visa fees and slowed down processing times. While the UK has a goal of increasing the number of international students, it has restricted most of them from bringing dependents, required them to prove they have enough money to support themselves, and banned them from working until they finish their degrees.
Massachusetts could have an edge with international students who still want to come to the United States but to a place more outwardly accepting of migrants, some experts say. That’s been a concerted approach at BU, for instance, Corriveau said at the April conference in Brookline. “I used to try to sell the US in general, and now I focus more locally,” she said. “I think it’s more important that students understand what it means to be in Boston.” BU even produced a video for prospective international students acknowledging “recent events” but promoting Boston as “remarkably diverse and inclusive.”
Many international students in Massachusetts stuck around for the summer, instead of going home, out of fear they might not be allowed to re-enter the country, university administrators say. Schools including Wentworth helped find them houses and summer jobs, Grek said at the BU meeting. UMass Amherst set up a fund to help them. Bunker Hill Community College canceled summer study abroad programs out of fear that international students wouldn’t be allowed to come back.
Over the longer term, however, the state’s strength in attracting international students makes it more vulnerable than other places in the United States to a continued decline in the number of them, says Chris Slatter, Boston-based managing director at the education consulting firm Huron.
“They rent apartments, they spend in local businesses, they support innovation through research, and in many cases they contribute to the workforce,” Slatter says. “International students are the cornerstone of both institutional strategy and regional economic vitality in Massachusetts.”
If they don’t keep coming, “and, when appropriate stay, and work here, what we’d have is a different economy,” says Tom Dretler, CEO of the Boston-based international student recruitment company Shorelight. “We would be a poorer state.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Time is money, and overtime is extra money.
Just ask the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, which needs more and more state funding to cover overtime costs because it can’t hire enough correctional officers. 
The Ocean State spent the 14th most per capita on its correctional facilities and operations of any state nationwide in fiscal 2023, despite having the third lowest number of incarcerated people, according to a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council report published Monday.
The 37-page report highlights how Rhode Island compares with other states on various spending categories, along with state and local tax rates. 
Rhode Island ranks near the top of the pack on per-person spending, boosted by a tranche of federal pandemic aid and congressional infrastructure and economy funds.
“A lot of the stories we see in this report are the same,” Justine Oliva, RIPEC’s policy and research director said in an interview Monday. “We are a relatively high tax state, and a relatively high spending state. We have historically spent a lot on government administration and on public safety.”
The business-backed policy group last reported Rhode Island’s tax and spending comparisons in 2019. The new edition also includes fiscal 2018 data to offer a five-year evolution in state spending and tax patterns relative to its peers.
Rhode Island boasted the highest per capita spending on general government administration of any state in the nation, reflecting personnel, planning and zoning and allocations to government and legislative agencies. The first place finish marks a slight rise from fiscal 2018, when Rhode Island rounded out the top three states based on per capita government administration spending. 
A bigger shift over the last five years: spending on the state corrections agency, which rose more than 35% per capita from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023. Not because its prisons are full — the 124 incarcerated people per 100,000 state residents is only greater than Maine and Massachusetts, according to 2022 federal data.
The report does not specify where the funding for the state corrections operations is going. But like other state agencies, personnel — including pensions and benefits — consume a big chunk of the bottom line, Oliva said.
70 correctional officer vacancies 
Especially true for the Department of Corrections, which has been plagued by vacancies that result in costly overtime for the remaining employees. 
In fiscal 2025, the state agency paid for nearly 594,000 overtime hours, according to the agency’s fiscal 2027 budget request to Gov. Dan McKee. The budget request did not specify the cost of overtime in fiscal 2025, but the longstanding staffing woes were projected to cost nearly $43 million in overtime for the year, according to a March presentation to lawmakers.   
Director Wayne Salisbury Jr. proposed hiring 150 more officers — to fill the 70 existing openings and add funding for more workers — to “properly staff” facilities and decrease overtime costs.
“If these positions are authorized and filled, it is anticipated that the Department would see a significant decrease in overtime,” Salisbury wrote in the Oct. 1 letter to McKee.
The request remains under review. The governor is expected to release a preliminary version of fiscal 2027 spending plan early next year.
A spokesperson for the corrections department did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.

Corrections is not the only area where Rhode Island outspends its peers, including most of the region. Police spending per capita ranked fifth overall in fiscal 2023, while spending on fire protection came in third. While states with densely populated cities typically spend more on fire protection, Rhode Island’s costs are still higher than other densely populated states, such as New Jersey, according to the National Fire Protection Association.
RIPEC’s report stops short of offering budget tips to state and local lawmakers. But Oliva pointed to Rhode Island’s disproportionate public safety spending as one area ripe for examination.
“We have to ask about what we are getting for what we are spending and the efficiency of those dollars,” Oliva said. “There is not a clear reason why Rhode Island is spending more than the nation, and neighboring states, on public safety.”
The report does not separate spending by the state government from what is spent by municipal governments, which can also vary widely, Oliva noted.
Also due for review: state K-12 education spending. Rhode Island state and local governments directed large swaths of federal pandemic relief aid to elementary and secondary education, boosting expenditures even higher. Rhode Island boasted the ninth highest per capita K-12 education spending in fiscal 2023 — and the sixth-highest based on personal income.










We have to ask about what we are getting for what we are spending and the efficiency of those dollars. There is not a clear reason why Rhode Island is spending more than the nation, and neighboring states, on public safety.


– Justine Oliva, RIPEC’s policy and research director


Yet Rhode Island students aren’t rising to the top of the class. While standardized test scores inched up in 2025, according to newly released results, the Ocean State still lags behind Massachusetts. It ranked 28th on educational outcomes in the 2025 KIDS COUNT report — the weakest showing across various metrics of state children’s wellbeing.
Meanwhile, state spending on Medicaid and other social service programs continues to balloon, outpacing per capita averages nationwide and in New England. RIPEC has long warned about unsustainable state budget growth, particularly on Medicaid, which comprised more than one-third of the $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget.
Federal cuts loom
Federal budget cuts to the government-subsidized health care program will only add pressure to insurers and providers, who have already clamored for state lawmakers to make them whole. Other federal budget cuts to state food stamp programs and health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are expected to hit Rhode Island hard.
“There’s no question Rhode Island is more vulnerable than a majority of states in terms of what happens federally,” Oliva said.

Property tax revenue remains the state’s top source of income, but the phaseout of the motor vehicle excise tax — eliminated in 2022 — suppressed revenue growth from property taxes, which rose 1.5% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023, according to the report. But Rhode Island’s property tax rates are still higher than most states, ranked 10th per person in fiscal 2023.
Oliva expected the Ocean State’s tax ranking to inch up in coming years, reflecting changes made in other states to reduce income taxes.
Oliva reiterated RIPEC’s resounding warning about the need for state and local lawmakers to reign in spending. But, that doesn’t mean cuts across the board.
“There are some areas in which increased spending might be an important part of improving our economic standing,” Oliva said. “We shouldn’t be aiming to be the lowest spending state in all of these areas.”
Transportation and higher education are two areas that might benefit from an extra infusion of cash, Oliva said. 
While Rhode Island’s highway spending fell in the middle of the pack among states in fiscal 2023, it frequently ranks among the worst states for road quality and infrastructure safety. And, despite reliance on state public colleges and its university to boost the state’s labor market and research presence, Rhode Island’s spending on higher education ranked 44th per capita in fiscal 2023.

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Dana Edwards to discuss his article, “26 years after lobster die-off, CT lobstermen reflect on a net loss,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Dana’s story here. 
WSHU: As a visuals reporter, what got you interested in telling this story? Was it the allure of going out on the sound on a fishing boat?
DA: Yeah, that was definitely part of it. I actually spent part of my childhood living on a sailboat, so I’ve always been interested in being on the water. But another entryway I had into the story is that I was new to Connecticut as a visuals fellow this past summer at the Connecticut Mirror, and so I was exploring some waterfront towns. I tried a couple lobster rolls for research purposes, of course. And I, you know, I learned there’s this famous Connecticut style of lobster roll, but I learned that most of the lobster that’s now inside of those rolls is imported from Maine or Canada, and that, in fact, there are hardly any lobsters left in Long Island Sound. So that was sort of an aha moment for me. I, you know, I thought, what happened to the lobsters and to the lobstermen?
Another angle I had into this story is I was introduced to Roddy Grimshaw, who’s one of the state’s last remaining commercial lobster men in Stonington, and I just found it to be a fascinating and frankly tragic story about, you know, what used to be a really thriving industry in Long Island sound that was decimated in the late 90s by historic die off of the lobsters. It’s been a tough journey for the lobstermen since then, there’s been coverage of the, you know, struggles that the industry has faced. But I wanted to dive a bit deeper and add a visual angle to it as a photojournalist as well as a writer.
WSHU: Let’s talk a little bit about the die-off itself. There’s been a lot of research done into this. What was responsible for it, and did it pretty much kill off the entire industry?
DA: Yeah, it might be interesting to kind of walk you through what people found out in real time, because it was sort of an unprecedented mystery at the time, right? And so in 1998 that was the peak of lobster landings in Long Island Sound and in Connecticut as well, there were 10 million pounds of lobster that were hauled in that year. And then suddenly, in the fall of 1999 in August, dead and sort of sickly lobsters started washing up onto the sound. Then there was a huge storm that hit it was Tropical Storm Floyd in September of 1999 it rained about 12 inches, and after that, within just a matter of a week or so, lobstermen were pulling up, almost no lobsters at all, and the ones they were pulling up were dead or dying.
And so at first, scientists really did not know what was going on at all, but there was a suspicion that pesticides were the cause, because just a month before that tropical storm that washed so much water into the sound the states of New York and Connecticut had begun applying pesticides to combat West Nile virus, and because mosquitoes, which the pesticides are designed to kill, are related to lobsters, that’s why people call lobsters bugs. People suspected that the pesticides killed the lobsters. There was a bunch of money that came in from the federal government to fund research into the causes of disaster, and after a few years, they found out the primary causes were a crustacean disease parasitic amoeba called parame biasis, and that the warming waters due to global warming were also a large contributing factor, because lobsters are extremely sensitive to warm waters, and so that had weakened their immune systems, making them even more vulnerable to the disease. They determined that the pesticides never reached the lethal levels in several modeling exercises.
WSHU: But also, there’s contention that there was a boom in the lobster industry in Connecticut, and that had been enabled by the fact that the fishermen were actually feeding the lobsters. So there, in the late 1980s into the 90s, there was just a real boom in the number of lobsters that were caught in Long Island Sound, which was not traditionally the case.
DA: Yeah, that’s a great point. Yeah. So that was an additional factor. Researchers referred to a quote, “perfect storm” of factors that led to this die-off. And just as you mentioned, the lobstering practices in the 80s and 90s, lobstermen referred to farming and harvesting the lobster rather than catching them. That’s because, you know, they’re using these pots or traps in which they put bait, which is, you know, various kinds of fish that are caught through other means. But they’re putting a ton of fish into these pots, and that represents a huge supplement to the natural food source of the lobsters. And so it actually artificially increased the lobster population in Long Island Sound significantly.
So there were far more lobsters on the sea floor than there had ever been, which is a little bit counterintuitive. You might think that, you know, as these lobster hauls were increasing, they were depleting the population. What they were actually doing was increasing it, but they were increasing it in a way where they were harvesting lobsters when they were young, you know, as soon as they reached the minimum size that was required by regulation. And so you had these extremely crowded conditions on the sea floor, and they were mostly young lobsters. And the biologists think that those made the lobsters even more susceptible to the die off, because they were young, and they were, you know, the disease could just spread really quickly through those crowded conditions.
WSHU: Now, you talk to the few lobstermen remaining. What happened? Because it was a pretty large industry at one time in Connecticut, there were a lot of Connecticut ports that had lobster fishermen, from Greenwich all the way up to North Stonington.
DA: So, you know, in the years after the die-off, it was this very sudden event. But it wasn’t like immediately the industry was not viable. The population would ebb and flow a bit for years, but it was trending significantly down. You know, some years would be a bit better, and that biologists think that has a lot to do with years when the water was a bit cooler, because the lobsters really just cannot tolerate warm water. So when the conditions were a bit better, you know, lobstermen were still able to, you know, make something of a living. But on the whole, most of them were no long longer able to support themselves lobstering, because it just trended significantly downwards. In 2024 there, the lobster catch in Connecticut was only 5% of what it was at its peak in 1998.
So most of the lobstermen were forced to leave the fishing docks behind entirely. Some of them switched to clamming or catching conch shells or fishing, but it’s hard to say percentage wise, but it seems like the vast majority just had to leave fishing behind entirely, and it was an extremely difficult transition. I spoke to a social scientist named Tarsila Seara who studied the social impacts of the die off and the impacts on the kind of fishing culture, and it really is a tragic story there. There were a lot of people who struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse, and the government put in place various job retraining programs, but they were not well received by the lobster men. There’s just sort of widespread bitterness about the die off. Most of the lobster men think that the pesticides were the cause, and they also hold a lot of grudges against the politicians who they don’t think we’re supporting, and the scientists whose explanations they disagree with.
WSHU: So the bottom line, are we ever going to have a viable lobster industry on the Long Island Sound?
DA: It looks extremely unlikely. In my reporting, in my story, the sort of state’s last commercial lobsterman who I profiled, they’re operating up in Stonington. That’s really the last active commercial lobster fleet in the state, and they’re not even full time. Most of them go out a couple days a week, and then they augment that with fishing. And the reason that they’re still able to catch lobster up in Stonington is that they’re just outside of the sound, and the water is slightly cooler there, and it wasn’t hit as hard by the die off in the late 90s and following years. So there’s still some lobster up there, all the way near the Rhode Island border. But deeper into the sound all the former lobstermen I spoke with who still put out some traps from time to time, just to just to see what’s out there. And they’re not catching anything. They’re a tiny fragment of what, you know, what there used to be. So, the scientific consensus is that the waters have just gotten too warm, even though this disease epidemic has passed, the American lobster just cannot tolerate the bottom temperatures due to global warming, and historically Long Island Sound was the southernmost end of the inshore range of the American lobster. So now it seems that it moved north. And you know, it may soon be the case that the southernmost tip is Massachusetts.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LOBSTER-0925-DE-206-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-10-20 14:58:31.343829

(South Dakota Searchlight/Courtesy SD Public Utilities Commission)Last month, utilities regulators voted 2-1 to tell a company that wants to put industrial scale batteries near Watertown that they’ll need a permit before they build.
Last week, lawyers for the company behind the $174 million project signaled plans to do just that.
Crowned Ridge Energy Storage I, LLC, is an affiliate of Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources. The company unsuccessfully lobbied the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission  for a permitting exemption in August, arguing the project does not meet the legal definition of a facility.
If built, the project would be the first large-scale, standalone battery storage facility of its kind in the state of South Dakota. Documents filed by the company with regulators say it would utilize lithium ion or similar battery storage technology.
South Dakota utility regulators decide energy storage facility needs a state permit

The company’s lawyers filed a notice of intent to apply for a permit last week, following the ruling against its petition for an exemption. The filing outlines a plan to construct, own, and operate a battery system with a 120-watt capacity in Codington County, about 20 miles northeast of Watertown. The project could store and continuously deliver enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes for four hours before needing to recharge, the document says.
The batteries would cover roughly 15.4 acres and connect to a nearby Crowned Ridge-owned substation. It would store excess electricity from regional wind generation and release it when demand peaks. When less electricity is being used at night, the batteries can charge, and in the morning, when families flick on the lights, that stored electricity can be used.   
Most impacted land is agricultural, and would be leased or bought, the filing says. Construction is expected to employ about 180 workers and result in one or two permanent jobs.
The company anticipates a final permit decision by April 2027. If approved, construction could begin in May, targeting commercial operation in early 2028.
The state’s three elected utilities regulators entered uncharted territory when the project appeared on thier docket last month. 
Commissioner Chris Nelson argued in September that “batteries don’t generate electricity” and therefore fall outside the agency’s jurisdiction. 
Commissioners Kristie Fiegen and Gary Hanson disagreed, saying large-scale storage puts usable electricity into the grid when discharging and should face public review.
Now, Crowned Ridge must secure both a state facility permit. It will also need conditional use  and building permits and a road-use agreement from Codington County.

The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has charged Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill with committing acts that would render her Controlled Substances Act registration inconsistent with the public interest; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct or practices harmful or detrimental to the public; forging or altering a prescription; failing to maintain a separate registration for each location where she distributed or dispensed controlled substances; dispensing a controlled substance without a prescription; possessing a controlled substance not obtained directly from a valid prescription, and dispensing medication not based on a valid patient-prescriber relationship.

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Thompson with eight separate regulatory violations. The disciplinary charges filed by the nursing board include failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and reviewing the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispending of an opioid.
The two licensing boards have not publicly disclosed the manner in which any of their respective regulations were allegedly violated or indicated when or where the alleged violations took place.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the store closed in September 2024.
According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.” The company also alleged Thompson had violated her franchise agreement with Live Hydration by opening a competing business that offered IV vitamin therapy, injections, hormone replacement therapy and Botox treatments. Thompson denied all of the company’s allegations.
Thompson is now suing Live Hydration for breach of contract and defamation, alleging the company tried to “starve” her franchise and mount a hostile takeover of the Ames location – charges the company denies. A trial is scheduled for Dec. 15, 2026.
State records indicate the Iowa Board of Nursing approved the disciplinary charges against Thompson in April 2025, although those records also indicate the charges were not publicly reported until September 2025. A hearing on the nursing board’s disciplinary charges was scheduled for Oct. 10, 2025, although the disposition of that case is not yet known.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy records indicate that board’s charges against Thompson were approved in January 2025, although they were only recently posted to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website. A hearing on the pharmacy board’s disciplinary charges is scheduled for Jan. 6, 2026.

(Mac Johnson/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen is asking a district court judge to pause a lawsuit over whether he will hand the state’s voter data to the federal government in light of the ongoing federal shutdown.
Nebraska Solicitor General Cody Barnett and the state Attorney General’s Office, on behalf of Evnen in a Friday motion, asked that the case be delayed so Evnen could continue discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice over how voter privacy would be protected. Negotiations had to pause because of the ongoing federal shutdown since Sept. 30 — now on day 20.
The motion states that without federal funding, Justice Department attorneys can’t work, even on a voluntary basis. It asks to pause the case until Evnen can reopen discussions, but to resume it no more than 60 days after the shutdown ends. 
“It is in the interest of judicial economy and conducive to an efficient resolution of this matter that this agreement be completed and available for production before the next stages of litigation,” the motion states.

Evnen anticipates the discussions “will yield an agreement that will impact the arguments made in this case,” according to the motion. That could mean getting in writing how the privacy of the voter information — names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers — would be protected.
The motion also confirms that Evnen will not send the requested voter data to the federal government during the course of the lawsuit.
The Justice Department requested Nebraska’s fuller voter file Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline. The lawsuit was filed Sept. 22 by Omaha voter Dawn Essink and voter advocacy group Common Cause.
Attorney Daniel Gutman, for Essink and Common Cause, confirmed that his clients do not oppose Evnen’s motion but still oppose the federal request for voter information.
“We continue to believe that releasing the entire voter file to the federal government is plainly unlawful under Nebraska statutes,” Gutman said Monday. “That’s true regardless of whether the state reaches an MOU [memorandum of understanding] with any third party, including the federal government.”
Attorney Daniel Gutman of Lincoln, center, in Lancaster County District Court. May 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The lawsuit cites a state law prohibiting election officials from disclosing certain voter information, preventing third parties from making or receiving copies of the voter registry and restricting the use of voter registry copies to only “list maintenance” or law enforcement purposes. Anyone who receives the information must attest that they will use the list for authorized purposes and won’t post it online, under threat of election falsification charges, a Class IV felony.
A public, more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, with redactions, is available for a fee.
Evnen told KFAB in late September that he doesn’t have “any problem” with handing over voter data and is glad the DOJ is looking at other states, “because while I’m very confident about Nebraska,” he said questions had been raised about others.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has also defended the federal government’s request, saying the information sought “is well within bounds. It’s well within the law.”
Lancaster County District Judge Lori Maret had not yet ruled on the delay as of mid-day Monday but is expected to approve the unopposed motion.

“Florida has been, I think, the state that has provided the most law enforcement agreements under the 287(g) than any other state” she said at the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office in Bradenton. “It shows that they recognize the importance of bringing individuals to justice that have [been] convicted [of] crimes against the people that live in their communities.”
Under legislation passed by GOP lawmakers in Tallahassee earlier this year, all 67 counties in Florida are required to enter into 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That program allows local law enforcement to work with ICE to deport undocumented immigrants. Although municipalities in Florida are not required to enter into those agreements, hundreds of them have — including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and St. Petersburg.
Noem said she came to West Central Florida on Monday because often “we see the news distorting the truth and not bringing the real facts” to the public when it comes to ICE detaining “criminal illegal aliens.”
She specifically cited the cases of four undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds who have recently been detained and deported.
Since January, Noem said, DHS has arrested more than 480,000 undocumented immigrants, 70% of whom she said had either been charged or convicted of criminal allegations. However, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, as of Sept. 21, 71.5% held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction.
She also touted how effective the Trump administration’s offer to allow people to “self-deport” has been. DHS has promised to give individuals who wish to return to their countries of origin $1,000 each and one-way airplane tickets.
The DHS reported last month 1.6 million people have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 people have been deported since Jan. 20.
Noem also reported that since ICE began advertising for 10,000 new agents, the agency has received more than 175,000 applicants.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After two months of higher-than-expected tax revenues, Nebraska’s monthly general fund receipts fell just before economic forecasters will update the state’s projected budget deficit. 
Nebraska’s September tax receipts show a net loss of 6.6% under what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in April, according to the state Department of Revenue. That equates to roughly $47 million in less revenue in the state’s coffers. 
State Sen. Robert Clements of Elmwood. (Courtesy of the Unicameral Information Office)
That followed tax receipts from July and August, which came in modestly above projections and brought in an additional $32 million. Appropriations Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood said while September’s drop is “disappointing,” he wasn’t too concerned, because overall net receipts for the current fiscal year remained relatively flat. 
Net tax receipts so far for fiscal year 2025-26 are about 0.9% below forecasts — a difference of about $15 million, the Revenue Department noted.
The biggest contributor to the drop was corporate income tax receipts, which came in 31% below projections, a loss of $56 million. Clements said he suspects that this is ImagiNE Act tax credits accelerating in September, based on information he received from a department analyst. 
The ImagiNE Act is an economic incentive program for businesses expanding in or relocating to Nebraska. Clements said the program was expected to dole out about $36 million in credits over 12 months, but it’s distributed roughly $22 million over the last three months alone. The incentives, within limits under state law, allow businesses to pick which tax year to take the tax credits, which can make predicting the timing more difficult.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said other factors may be at play as well, including a drop in quarterly estimated corporate tax payments. State officials previously hoped these payments would raise September’s receipts above projections, but Patent said if corporate profits have fallen this fiscal year, that would lower their payments. 
The outlier in the Revenue report was miscellaneous taxes, which came in 365% above projections, but that slice is the smallest portion of Nebraska’s overall tax revenues. That resulted in an additional net $18 million for the month, a small portion of the $661 million the state generated in September. 
Miscellaneous taxes are a bit of a mixed bag, but they can include things like Nebraska’s alcohol and cigarette taxes.
Patent said this was not due to any changes in miscellaneous taxes, but was more due to past projections. She said the state bases its miscellaneous tax projections based on monthly receipts from the previous year, which is why July’s miscellaneous receipts were about 41% below forecast, and September’s essentially offset that, Patent said. 
“It’s really just a timing thing,” she said. “It doesn’t have to do with the receipts themselves.” 
September’s receipts are significant because it’s one of the last pieces of information the forecasting board will receive before its next meeting Oct. 31. However, both Clements and Patent said the board also will receive some early estimates for October revenues because it is meeting at the end of the month. 
The board’s new projections will update the state’s expected budget deficit, which currently stands around $95 million. Members will consider monthly general fund receipts, as well as other economic factors. 
Another factor the board could consider is the impact of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” A separate Revenue report from September estimated that the new tax and spending law could cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two years of its current budget cycle. Pillen and other conservative state leaders supported the bill.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — A required work zone safety course for Oklahoma teen drivers is expanding to include an impaired driving section, the program’s founder said Monday at a driving school in Edmond. 
Tom Robins, the founder of Work Zone Safe, said impaired driving is 100% preventable and now students will learn about the impacts. More than 400 lives in Oklahoma are lost every year due to impaired driving-related crashes, according to a news release. 
“Impaired driving impacts us all, and it impacts us forever,” he said. “And so we know that teens during National Teen Driver Safety Week are going to get an opportunity now in the state of Oklahoma to have a section just specifically on impaired driving so that they can learn from the faces and families behind the flags and the flashing lights.”
Taking the course is required in Oklahoma since it became part of state law in 2023, Robins said. Over 110,000 Oklahoma teens have taken the free course. 
The impaired driving section of the course will include stories of a handful of people killed by an impaired driver, including an Edmond police officer and a student at University of Central Oklahoma. 
Students will also be taught about the impact of driving while impaired. 
Some short-term effects include arrest, fines, jail time, license suspension and raised insurance costs, according to a news release. Long-term consequences include having a criminal record, prison sentences and limited job opportunities.
Work Zone Safe is currently required in Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Wisconsin but is expanding to other states, Robins said. Oklahoma was the first state to require the course. 
Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Foster, who was hit by an impaired driver in 2021, said he’s experienced first-hand what can happen when someone operating a vehicle doesn’t make good decisions. 
He said if the impaired driver hadn’t hit his stationary car, 10 people in a work zone could have been killed. 
“It’s not just about passing a test,” Foster said. “It’s about learning how serious the privilege of driving is. Because every time you start your car, you hold the power to protect or to destroy your parents, your friends, your community. We’re all counting on you to be the kind of driver who pays attention, who plans ahead, who chooses safety over speed, and responsibility over recklessness.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Five months after the Trump administration canceled a series of environmental grants for Alaska, including an erosion-control grant that was to have gone to one of the villages hardest hit by ex-Typhoon Halong, the fight over the money continues.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in her speech Saturday to the annual Alaska Federation of Natives convention, said she is trying to restore some of the canceled funding, including money that was to have gone to the Yukon-Kuskokswim Delta village of Kipnuk. The village of 700 had been awarded $20 million by the Biden administration to combat problems connected with permafrost thaw and other climate change effects, but in May the Trump administration canceled that and other grants.
Murkowski blasted officials who characterized the grant to Kipnuk as wasteful.
“I am offended,” she said. “I am outright mad that some have suggested that it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to protect Alaskan communities. We are Americans. Every single person that has been impacted is an American that deserves to be treated with that level of respect.”
Murkowski was responding obliquely to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and his spokesperson, who issued what delegates to the AFN convention considered to be insulting statements.

The village of Kipnuk, largely submerged by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, is seen from the air on Oct. 12, 2025.

In a post on the social media site X, Zeldin called news reports about the canceled grant “left-wing hackery” that were dishonest. The grants would not have provided protection in time for ex-Typhoon Halong, he said.
“And to be brutally candid, due to the proactive cancellation of this grant, $20 million of hardworking U.S. tax dollars are currently sitting in the U.S. treasury instead of swept into the Kuskokwim River,” his post said. He concluded the post on a pugnacious note: “As for the clowns who want the EPA to light tens of billions of tax dollars on fire, we refuse to bend the knee and play along.”
Grant cancellations hit Indigenous communities
The Kipnuk grant was to have paid for a barrier on the rapidly eroding Kugkaktlik River. The project was part of Kipnuk’s broader erosion control and climate-change adaptation plan, which includes elements of “managed retreat,” the relocation of some structures and facilities to safer ground farther from the river.
Murkowski, in her AFN speech, said it may be true that work under the canceled grant would not have come in time for the devastation wrought by ex-Typhoon Halong. But that and other grants were still needed, she said.
“They may prevent future disasters, and that’s the point,” she said. “It’s not just what happens today. It’s the ability to look forward out into the future, to make it better into the future.”
Most of Kipnuk’s residents were airlifted out of the storm-wrecked village, part of the more than 1,500 people now taking shelter in Bethel, Anchorage or other spots. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is one of the most rural parts of North America; no road connects its communities, where the mostly Yup’ik residents depend on traditional Indigenous fishing, hunting and other food-gathering practices.
The Kipnuk grant had been among several awarded by the Biden administration to Alaska Native communities under the EPAs’ Community Change Grant Program. That program was funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a piece of legislation that passed with no Republican votes. In all, over $150 million in Alaska grants under the program were canceled by the Trump administration.

Robyn Burke, D-Utqiagvik, in her Juneau office on May 20, 2025, holds a May 2 letter from the Environmental Protection Agency annoucning that it has canceled funding for a permafrost management project. The project had been selected during the Biden administration under EPA’s Community Change Grant Program. It would have funded protections for traditional Inupiat ice cellars and gravesites in the nation’s nothernmost community and provided new equipment for the local utility cooperative that provides electricity, gas, water and wastewater services. The grant totaled $20 million and work was to have started that month. It was one of several Community Change Program grants canceled in Alaska. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Among the nixed grants was $20 million previously awarded to Kotzebue for expansion of wind power. As in other areas of rural Alaska, residents of Kotzebue are seeking to reduce reliance on diesel fuel, which is costly and difficult to transport and store, by shifting to locally produced renewable energy.  
The administration also canceled a previously awarded $20 million grant to Utqiagvik, the nation’s northernmost community, for work to protect infrastructure from permafrost thaw, improvements to the utility system and other environmental tasks.
Aside from the more than $150 million in Community Change Grant Program funding for Alaska that the Trump administration’s EPA canceled, the agency also eliminated the Biden-era Solar For All program and, with it, $125 million in funding that had been awarded to expand solar energy in Alaska.
At a news conference following her AFN speech, Murkowski said the state’s congressional delegation and others might be able to use a $40 million pot of money to restore some of the lost project funding. That would be much less than a full restoration, she conceded.
“The Community Change Grant Program was very specific, and the criteria were very specific. And so many of our communities, including Kipnuk, met the criteria,” she told reporters. “That’s where the real tragedy is in all of this. But we’re working to get some portion of that funding to go towards Kipnuk again, to recognize that you’ve got a vulnerability in the community and how they’re able to address it. You can’t do it with just a lot of good thoughts.”
The administration also eliminated a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. That program funded projects intended to prevent damages from disasters like floods, thus saving money that would be spent on recovery and repair.
Murkowski said the administration has taken the position that it will oppose anything having to do with resilience or “anything that has the word ‘climate’ in it,” she said.
“Crazy, in my view,” she said.
In her convention speech, Murkowski described what she saw the previous day in Kipnuk — an eerily quiet village that a week earlier would have been filled with children playing and four-wheelers zipping around. She also saw one of the main obstacles to escaping this and other storms. 
“Flying over, you realize there is no retreat to higher ground, because there is no higher ground in many parts of the delta,” she said.
Public broadcasting funding loss another AFN concern
Beyond her comments on the remnants of Typhoon Halong, Murkowski lamented the recent vote by Congress to rescind all previously appropriated funding for public broadcasting.

	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a key source of funding for rural Alaska stations, and Murkowski voted against recission of its funding. The other two members of Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation, Sen. Dan Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich, were enthusiastic supporters of the recission, which had been championed by President Donald Trump.
Murkowski said she and Sullivan eked out a slight reprieve by securing some Bureau of Indian Affairs money to help 14 rural Alaska stations. “But that’s one-time money. That’s this year. What about next year?” she said.
The role of public broadcasting and the threat posed by elimination of previously awarded federal funding was much discussed at the convention. Attention to that issue was heightened by the typhoon disaster and the role that public broadcasting, notably the Bethel outlet KYUK, played in relaying emergency information.
Several attendees, including those staging a silent protest during Sullivan’s speech on Friday, held signs that said: “Public radio saves lives.”
Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, in an address on Friday, urged audience members and organizations to donate to public broadcasting outlets to make up for the loss of federal support.
“We learned a lot how important public radio is, based on the last week or so,” Edgmon said.
Like other rural outlets, Bethel’s KYUK, which broadcasts across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the Yup’ik language as well as in English, has been highly dependent on support from the now-defunded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said Kristin Hall, the outlet’s manager.
“For KYUK, that funding made up nearly 70% of our annual operating budget,” Hall said during a panel discussion Thursday on public broadcasting. “That funding is not just a line item. That is not just a line item in our budget. That is our livelihood.”
Public broadcasting in rural Alaska is about much more than emergency communications, Hall and other panel members said. The Indigenous content is a comfort to elders, educational for youth and an important part of civic life in the villages, they said.
“Not only do we provide cultural and traditional knowledge, but it’s also a human need to see ourselves in media,” said Jaclyn Sallee, president of Kohanic Broadcast Corp., an Alaska-based nonprofit that produces and distributes Indigenous programs statewide and nationally.

Ashlee Rezin/Sun-TimesThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between WBEZ and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
The Silver carp is big, unwieldy, and requires Joe Greendyk use both hands to measure it before tossing the fish overboard into the Illinois River.
The nearly 2-foot-long aquatic menace, which now overruns the river, has become the target of a state-run monitoring program to rein in its exploding numbers.
“They’re pretty slimy and pretty strong,” Greendyk says with his hands caked in fish slime. He’s a seasonal field researcher with the Illinois Natural History Survey. “So if you don’t grip them right, they’re pretty hard to control.”
For decades, local, state and federal officials have worried that the carp could bypass Chicago and breach the Great Lakes, possibly reducing populations of native species that locals like to fish. The feared spread could wreak havoc on the world’s largest freshwater ecosystem and the multibillion-dollar tourism, boating and fishing industries that rely on it. Carp, which can out-eat and outgrow native fish, can also leap out of the water and startle boaters.

The fight to keep the carp under control and out of the Great Lakes may be getting easier. Last week, Illinois announced it had acquired land needed to move forward with a $1.15 billion barricade aimed at keeping the voracious Asian carp from entering the channel that connects the Mississippi River Basin with the Great Lakes.
The barricade, called the Brandon Road Interbasin Project, is an underwater defense system long hailed as the solution to the carp problem.
Designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it’s slated to be built in the Des Plaines River, which connects the Illinois River to Chicago’s shipping canal near suburban Joliet. The billion dollar lock and dam upgrade will deploy a bubble wall, acoustic blasts, an electric barrier and a flushing mechanism to keep the carp from passing through.
Last week, Illinois officials announced they had reached a deal on Sept. 30 for the two small upland parcels totaling 2.75 acres required for the project. The donation may, however, end up costing Illinois taxpayers.

WBEZ and Grist have previously revealed longstanding concerns from state officials over contamination at the site caused by burning coal. Pritzker cited concerns about the cost of cleaning up the toxic mess in a 2024 letter to the Army Corps.
“It would be irresponsible to write a blank check to the Corps of Engineers or any other project manager without having a better understanding of what we’re agreeing to for the long term,” Pritzker’s spokesperson said in a statement at the time.
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources confirmed that state officials are currently developing a plan to investigate the site and are reviewing whether any additional land is needed.
Despite these concerns, regional leaders are pushing forward the necessary funding. Earlier this month, Pritzker joined six other Great Lakes governors in submitting a letter to Congress, calling the project a “national priority” and urging lawmakers to provide full federal financing.
The invasive carp — a family of fish which also includes the Bighead carp, Black carp and Grass Carp —  first turned up in the Mississippi River about 50 years ago. Experts say fish began overwhelming the waterway after escaping Arkansas fish farms, where they were imported to help limit algae and weed growth. In the intervening years, the fish expanded their range throughout the river and its tributaries — beginning to dominate the Illinois River in the 1990s.
From the back of the carp sampling boat where Greendyk grabbed the slimy fish, Michael Spear, a quantitative ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey, said the carp populations weren’t as high in the northern stretch of the river as they are further downstream.
“But still, we should see some action,” he said.
Back in 2019, the INHS partnered with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to establish a program to track the relative abundance of the carp up and down the Illinois River. As part of the program, crews of ecologists catch and track the health of the carp and native fish every year between June and October.
The data helps the state stay ahead of the carp. If populations are surging in one stretch of the river, Illinois officials can adapt their main form of carp control: paying commercial fishermen for targeted catches, including an extra 10 cents per pound of carp.
“We’re making an increasingly large dent in the population, according to these data,” Spear said. “That incentive seems to be paying off.”
He pointed to the area near Starved Rock State, one of the northernmost stretches of the more than 270-mile-long river, where he has noted drastic declines in the carp over the last five years. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources didn’t say exactly how much carp populations have declined.
Spear watched from the back of the boat as Greendyk and the rest of the crew wrapped up their sampling work for the day. While the data is promising, he said nobody wants to find out what happens if the carp ever make it past Chicago.
“The carp may not be in some of these other Great Lakes states,” Spear said. “But there’s a lot of attention from those states, because if they get into the Great Lakes, it’s going to become a much more regional problem.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carpottawa-1024x576.webp,,,2025-10-20 14:02:29.276627

(Photo via Roblox)Following a civil subpoena earlier this year, Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Monday that he is issuing a criminal subpoena to Roblox, an online video game.
According to Uthmeier’s office, “multiple investigations have revealed that sexual predators are using Roblox to access, communicate with, and groom minors.”
“Roblox profited off of our kids while exposing them to the most dangerous of harms. They enabled our kids to be abused,” Uthmeier said in a video posted to his social media. “Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids.”
The attorney general said there have been reports of predators using Robux, the in-game currency, “to bribe minors into sending sexually explicit images of themselves.”
According to the attorney general, victims accuse Roblox of failing to implement safety measures and failing to warn parents of the dangers the game could pose to their children. 
In a response to the Phoenix, Roblox said, “We share Attorney General Uthmeier’s commitment to keeping kids safe and we will continue to assist his office in their investigations.”
“We have a strong record of working with law enforcement and investing in advanced safety systems to help protect our users and remove bad actors. To safeguard users, we prohibit the sharing of images and videos in the chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information, and we are working to implement age estimation for all users accessing chat features,” Roblox continued.
The attorney general said there have been “troubling allegations” that the game has been negligent in verifying users’ ages and failed in content moderation. 
“These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on Roblox’ platform as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused,” Uthmeier said. 
Uthmeier appeared on Fox & Friends First Monday to talk about the launch of the investigation. 
“Here in Florida we’ve arrested over 1,000 child predators just this year, and many of these investigations lead right back to Roblox,” Uthmeier said. 
Predators often pose as young people and “engage in long-term dialogue” with the minors, “and in the worst of cases, we’ve seen actual physical abuse,” Uthmeier added.
In 2023 and 2024, Roblox was included on the National Center on Sexual Exploitation Dirty Dozen list. 
The list, since 2013, calls out “mainstream entities for facilitating, enabling, and even profiting from sexual abuse and exploitation.”
In 2024, other companies on the list included Reddit, Discord, Spotify, Telegram, LinkedIn, Meta, Apple, Cash App, GitHub, and Cloudfare. A federal law, the Communications Decency Act Section 230, provides legal immunity for for technology companies for material posted by users.
The center did not release a list of companies for 2025; instead, it showcased victims it said were denied justice as a result of the federal law and called for its repeal.
“While no system is perfect, our trained teams and automated tools continuously monitor communications to detect and remove harmful content. We are committed to leading the industry in safety and transparency,” Roblox concluded its statement.

In April, Uthmeier requested information from Roblox, such as how many of the game’s users are under the age of 16, marketing materials that relate to suitability for children, documents showing parental controls, and documents showing steps Roblox has taken to ensure children do not see mature content. 
Uthmeier’s April subpoena also sought communications with the National Center relating to Floridians and communication with Florida users reporting abuse.
Uthmeier told Fox & Friends that after the April subpoena, “what we found is evidence that they’ve been operating in a careless way. They know child predators are using the app to go after our kids and they haven’t done enough about it.”

(Courtesy photo)In a recent order, the New Mexico Supreme Court decided to move forward with the state’s request to remove embattled Eleventh Judicial District Attorney Bernadine Martin in McKinley County.
In August, citing violations of state law and other concerns, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a petition to remove Martin from office. The petition was sparked after state lawmakers voted to remove funding from Martin’s office and gave it to the neighboring district attorney in San Juan County, a move spearheaded by Senate Finance Chair George Muñoz (D-Gallup), citing turnover of Gallup prosecutors.
The findings in the AG’s petition included: a hostile workplace environment; failure to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; breaches of procurement law, despite a prior settlement with the State Ethics Commission; “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and Martin’s alleged continued work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
Martin has denied all allegations in court filings. A voicemail, text message and email to Martin were not returned before publication.
Additionally in September, the state took over prosecution of two cases, alleging Martin had improperly dismissed the cases and failed to send them to an outside prosecutor.
Martin has argued that the state law allowing for removal of district attorneys only applies to her current term, which started in January of 2025, after her reelection to office in 2024. She argued it would be “obviously unjust” for the New Mexico Supreme Court to hear evidence “for misconduct [that] may have occurred during a previous term.” Moreover, Martin contends removal of district attorneys should be left either to state lawmakers or voters “when the public official stands for reelection.”
The New Mexico Attorney General’s office disagreed, citing state laws that district attorneys may be removed from office in a court proceeding, for certain reasons including: “failure, neglect or refusal” to perform the duties of the office.
In an Oct. 17 order, the New Mexico Supreme Court determined to move forward with removal proceedings, and wrote that a further order would contain the reasoning at a later date.
State law for the removal of public officials requires a trial without a jury before the Supreme Court justices.
An initial hearing is scheduled virtually for Oct. 31, and will be overseen by Special Master Alan Malott, a retired Albuquerque district judge appointed by the state’s Supreme Court to help act as a trial judge, including clarifying the exact nature of arguments and scheduling.
The Supreme Court’s decision on a removal proceeding is final, according to state law.

	Speaker after speaker at the convention, the largest annual convention of any kind in Alaska and one of the largest Indigenous gatherings in the nation, referenced the storm. It has displaced more than 1,500 people, killed at least one person and dislodged houses from their foundations. Residents of stricken villages have been airlifted away, with hundreds getting temporary residency in Anchorage. The state’s largest city is about 490 miles east of the evacuees’ home villages, and vastly different in culture and character from the highly rural Indigenous communities.
“My heart with everyone impacted by the recent coastal storms,” Natasha Singh, the president of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the keynote speaker on the first day of the convention, said at the start of her address.
“While the damage is so vast, the love for our people is even greater. And even as we feel the pain and the loss, I also feel a sense of inspiration to see so many people reach out to help,” she continued.

	A special feature of the convention was a second-floor room at the Dena’ina Civic and Convention Center that was set aside to collect donations headed to the storm victims. Over two days, as convention proceedings unfolded in the third-floor ballroom, the collection room became filled with boxes of diapers, toiletries, clothing items, shelf-stable food and other necessities that were sorted by volunteers.
On Saturday, the final day, delegates passed a resolution seeking an immediate national disaster declaration, and investment by the federal government in better infrastructure in rural Alaska to protect against future disasters.
The ravages of the remnants ofTyphoon Halong demand more than an emergency response, the resolution said. The disaster “has continued to expose vulnerabilities in infrastructure, housing, and emergency preparedness for rural Alaska/extreme remote America, and highlights the need for stronger tribal-state-federal collaboration,” it said.

	The call for a national disaster declaration and the aid that would come with it was among a packet of resolutions passed on Saturday. Many of the resolutions concerned food security and efforts to ensure that Alaska Natives can safely practice their traditional fishing and hunting practices.
One highly anticipated convention speaker was former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, who is considered a possible candidate for governor or U.S. Senate.
But Peltola made no campaign announcement.
“I want to preface everything I’m saying with: This is going to be very anticlimactic for everybody, I think,” she said at the start of her speech. “No big announcements, no big declarations.”

	She spoke about the way subsistence ties Alaska Natives to their home regions.
“Those spots, the places that we hunt and fish, they’re like another personality to us,” Peltola said.
She referred to a close friend who recently died. When she was on her deathbed, her family gathered around, Peltola said. “And at one point, they just talked about places. They just said the names of the places where they pick berries, or get whitefish, gather greens. And it was one of the most beautiful moments I’ve ever experienced, just reciting names.”

At a time when the incarcerated population in county facilities is dropping — and budget-writers are struggling to navigate federal funding cuts and holes in tax revenue — one top Democrat said the request from sheriffs left “eyebrows raised” under the Golden Dome. 
“We certainly want to take a time out here,” Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues told CommonWealth Beacon. “We need to stabilize, investigate, and control the sheriffs’ spending in the future. This is an unsustainable path that the sheriffs are on.” 
Rodrigues said the Senate’s version of a so-called closeout budget — a spending bill needed to wrap up the state’s accounting for the fiscal year that ended June 30 — would create a “sheriff fiscal oversight council,” led by the administration’s public safety and budget secretaries. The governor would appoint three other members with experience in correctional facility operations and public finance.  
Sheriffs’ offices would be required to submit monthly reports to the panel, which Rodrigues said would “ensure that they’re fiscally and operationally accountable, [and] that the sheriffs are spending money maintaining activities that are actually specifically required by state law, case law, or court orders.” 
The panel would wield significant power. It would have access to “all records, documents, accounts, correspondence and any other data and material” it deems necessary from sheriffs’ offices. If those offices fail to meet financial targets recommended by the new organization, the council could appoint a receiver or even order the state comptroller not to certify new payments toward sheriffs. 
The Senate bill would dissolve the panel on January 1, 2028, but its members could vote to extend their work beyond that date. 
House and Senate budget-writers already agreed to withhold most of the money Gov. Maura Healey proposed to replenish sheriffs’ offices after spending overruns last cycle, supporting a much smaller $26.5 million sum to cover treatment services and free communication between incarcerated individuals and their loved ones.  
Legislative leaders in both chambers also want the inspector general to examine budgeting practices in sheriffs’ offices and report back next year. 
But Senate leaders want to do even more, and it’s not clear if House Democrats will get on board. Rodrigues said the IG investigation would be backward-looking, while the proposed new panel would instead keep finances under control moving forward. 
Protracted House-Senate negotiations could delay passage of everything else in the more than $2 billion spending bill, including hundreds of millions of dollars for MassHealth and a policy rider decoupling Massachusetts vaccine authority from the recommendations of a Centers for Disease Control panel. 
It’s common for state agencies and offices to spend more than they received through the annual state budget, then to request additional money at the end of the fiscal year.  
But, Beacon Hill insiders say lawmakers for years have had questions about the way sheriffs approach their year-end shortfalls. The sudden jump in scale this time around, combined with the heightened scrutiny on sheriffs amid a series of political controversies, seems to have pushed House and Senate Democrats to take a harsher stance. 
A year ago, the fiscal year 2024 closeout budget provided sheriffs with an additional $46 million. Rodrigues said that was a “record” amount at the time. 
Healey’s fiscal 2025 closeout proposal sought nearly $163 million for sheriffs — more than three times as much as last year and roughly 22 percent of the amount they received through the annual budget. 
“No other state agency or department overspends their budget by 22 percent,” Rodrigues said.  
Sheriffs said they faced major cost growth due to salary increases, substance use disorder care, and the “no-cost calls.” The Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said it projects the free communication program cost all sheriffs a combined $12.4 million in fiscal year 2025.   
“For years, the Sheriffs have invested in evidence-based programs that make Massachusetts a national leader in corrections and rehabilitation — especially when it comes to saving lives and improving health outcomes,” a spokesperson for the association said last week. “These are proven, responsible investments in public safety and community well-being. We welcome any review that strengthens public confidence and supports our continued focus on operating safe, efficient facilities that help people rebuild their lives.”  
Legislative leaders did not learn of the apparent massive financial need for sheriffs’ offices until Healey filed her spending bill in August, according to Rodrigues. 
“We’re not satisfied with the level of communication [from sheriffs],” he said. “This caught us completely by surprise.” 
Healey, who moved to fulfill sheriffs’ full request for nearly $163 million, has not weighed in on whether she also has skepticism about the need or supports the Legislature’s push for additional scrutiny. A spokesperson for the governor last week said only that she would review any bill sent to her. 
The Legislature’s approach could become a talking point on the campaign trail. Two Republican challengers for governor, Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve, last week criticized the House bill for withholding funds and seeking an IG probe. 
Massachusetts sheriffs are primarily responsible for managing county correctional facilities. Similar to a trend within state prisons, the number of people incarcerated in county jails has been declining. In March, sheriffs reported they had a combined 7,048 in custody, less than half of the available capacity. 
Rising spending and falling incarceration is not a new development. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the average daily population overseen by sheriffs dropped 16 percent, while the number of total sheriffs’ employees grew 5 percent, according to a MassINC report published in 2017.

(Courtesy photo)Democratic precinct committee members in Indiana House District 9 on Saturday unanimously elected LaPorte County Councilman Randy Novak as the state district’s next representative. He was unopposed.
The real estate agent will serve out the remainder of former Rep. Pat Boy’s term, which runs through November 2026. Boy resigned her post early.
Novak is an alumnus of the AFL-CIO’s Path to Power program, which recruits and elects candidates to run for local government offices. The initiative is meant to promote pro-worker policies in local government and develop a bench of candidates to move into higher office, according to the website.
Novak served on the LaPorte County Council for over a decade before winning the caucus.
“I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Representative Pat Boy for her years of dedicated service and commitment to the people of our community. Her leadership has made a lasting impact, and it is truly an honor to be selected to continue her work at the Statehouse representing District 9,” he said in a press release. “To the residents of District 9, I pledge to serve with integrity, transparency, and dedication. I will work tirelessly to advance policies that strengthen our communities and improve the quality of life for everyone in our area.”
Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian oversaw the caucus, which included precinct committee members from both LaPorte and Porter counties in northwest Indiana.
“We are thankful for Representative-elect Randy Novak, and his willingness to serve Hoosiers at this moment. He’s been a champion for labor and our working families throughout his time on the County Council, and he will bring that same commitment to service with him to Indianapolis,” she said. “We appreciate his background in labor, and his 33 years of service to the Michigan City Fire Department, including retiring as Fire Chief. We are excited for the impact he will make from day one on supporting labor, public safety, and public schools.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)North Carolina Republicans are quickly advancing a plan to add another Republican seat to the state’s congressional delegation. A state Senate committee on Monday adopted a plan that would likely make one more district unwinnable for a Democrat.
Republicans are redrawing the northeast 1st Congressional District to be more advantageous for the GOP — a move that will likely flip control of the seat as President Donald Trump aims to maintain Republican control of the House after the midterms.
“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), said as he presented the plan at the Senate Elections Committee. “Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives. And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”
Trump posted a message on social media thanking North Carolina Republicans for the new map, writing it would give the state the opportunity to elect another MAGA Republican next year. He said he was “watching, and strongly supporting” the redistricting effort.
Mid-decade redistricting is not unusual in North Carolina because state and federal courts have struck down maps found to be illegal. But this is likely the first mid-decade redistricting with the express intent to help a president avoid a midterm slump.
U.S. Rep. Don Davis, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points after Republicans redrew the district in 2023 to be more Republican-friendly. The 1st district is currently rated a “toss-up” for 2026 by the Cook Political Report — North Carolina’s only competitive House seat.
The current configuration of the district is part of a federal lawsuit over the dilution of Black voting power. Hise said the new plan would stand up to legal challenges.
“We will defend these maps, and I am confident they will be held by the courts,” he said Monday.
With the new map, the state’s congressional delegation would move to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. Republicans currently hold 10 seats to Democrats’ four.
Stein: “Cynical power grab”
North Carolina is among several states drawn into the redistricting wars in recent months.
Texas was the first state to redistrict at Trump’s behest. Missouri followed. In response to the Texas redistricting, California Democrats approved a ballot measure that would add Democratic seats in that state. Voters there will decide in November whether to approve the new map.
North Carolina Democrats cannot prevent passage of district maps Republicans want. The GOP holds majorities in both the state House and Senate. And Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, is not permitted by law to veto the map.
Stein called the redrawn map a “cynical power grab” during a news conference Monday morning.
“The Republican legislature is abusing its power to take away yours,” Stein said, as he urged lawmakers to instead pass new spending for the state’s mental health system and Medicaid.
And he praised Davis, whom he said he had not personally spoken to, saying that Davis’s winning record in the district spoke to his ability to represent it well.
“Don Davis won because he is who they want,” Stein said. “The people of that district chose him … and now the Republican legislature is trying to take away the ability for the people of that district to make their own independent choice, by rigging the system so much that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for Rep. Davis to win.”
Hearing room cleared after outburst from audience
Hise’s committee presentation drew derisive laughter from members of the public who attended the meeting.
All public comment was negative, with the redrawn map being described as a racist power grab done at the request of a wannabe dictator.
Robert Yhl of Raleigh said the plan is a tool of voter suppression.
“It makes more sense to me for the legislature to do what their people elected it to do, and that is to conduct business for the people and not conduct activities ordered by a convicted felon,” he said.
As the committee prepared to vote, the audience began chanting “Racist maps make racist reps.” The committee room was emptied of most public spectators.
After the meeting, Sen. Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford), called the map “blatant racism.”
“Black people will not have representation in terms of ability to elect a person that they want,” she said. “Don Davis will be gone.”
Earlier this month, a rumor circulated that Senate Leader Phil Berger, who is being challenged in the next primary by his local sheriff, would redistrict in exchange for a Trump endorsement. Berger denied the rumor.
During Monday’s committee meeting, Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) pressed Hise on communication between Berger, other Republican senators, and the White House.
Hise said he didn’t talk to anyone from the White House, but couldn’t answer for anyone else.
Northeast U.S. House district has elected Black lawmakers for decades
The 1st District is historically significant. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a U.S. House seat from North Carolina.
Though it has mutated over the years, the district has been anchored by counties that are part of the Black Belt in the eastern part of the state. The South’s Black Belt was named for its fertile soil. The majority Black populations in some of the district’s counties, including Halifax, Hertford, and Bertie, are part of the legacy of slavery.
Several of those counties are moved out of the 1st District under the proposed map and into the 3rd, represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy. One of them, Greene County, is where Davis lives, although congressional candidates are not required to live in the districts they run in.
Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, who have both previously represented the district, released a joint statement Monday through Common Cause NC, strongly criticizing the new map.
“The proposed congressional map would silence communities that have long been the backbone of northeastern North Carolina, fracturing counties and towns that share common bonds of history, economy and hope,” Clayton and Butterfield said. “This is not merely a political act — it is a moral regression.”
And the pair added that they were “offended that the people … have not been given ample opportunity to provide their input.”
“This is not how democracy is supposed to work,” Clayton and Butterfield said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-NC-Map-1024x666.png,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)All over Ohio on Saturday, crowds turned out to protest the many controversies of the administration of President Donald Trump.
In the midst of a government shutdown over health care subsidies, organizers estimated that more than 10,000 turned out to protest at the Statehouse in Columbus. It was by far the largest protest there against the second Trump administration.
Large demonstrations in Cleveland and Cincinnati were also reported, in addition to estimates of more than 1,000 in smaller communities such as Bexley, Grandview and Pickerington. Indivisible Central Ohio, one of the organizers, estimated that 6,500 turned out in Westerville, more than 4,000 in Clintonville, and 2,000 in Delaware.
National organizers said the Ohio demonstrations were among 2,700 overwhelmingly peaceful protests in 50 states that drew about 7 million people.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Today, millions of Americans stood together to reject authoritarianism and remind the world that our democracy belongs to the people, not to one man’s ambition,” Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, co-founders of Indivisible, said in a written statement. “Authoritarians want us to believe resistance is futile, but every person who turned out today proved the opposite. This movement isn’t about a single protest; it’s about a growing chorus of Americans who refuse to be ruled. Trump may want a crown, but in this country, there are no kings.”
“No Kings” has been a slogan for a protest movement underpinned by dozens of organizers, including 50501, Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union and the League of Women Voters. Among many other issues, Trump’s critics object to masked immigration agents conducting violent arrests, attempts to deploy troops to cities over their mayors’ and governors’ wishes, using the Justice Department to target Trump’s political enemies, and bombing boats in the Caribbean on claims they were carrying drugs, but without furnishing any evidence.
More than 10,000 are estimated to have gone to the Ohio Statehouse Saturday to protest the administration of Donald Trump.(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)
In Columbus, thousands found those and other problems with Trump compelling enough to turn out in the middle of an Ohio State Buckeyes football game. Some noted the fact on signs they were carrying. 
Hundreds lined the sidewalks along High Street where it borders the state Capitol. Protesters waved signs, a makeshift band played, people danced and cars streamed by, laying on their horns in support. Ever the football-obsessed community, one car bore a sign saying “This Buckeye supports (Michigan) more than Trump.”
Standing on the Statehouse side of High Street, Columbus resident Phillip Johnson said the stakes couldn’t be higher.
“We’re in trouble as a nation,” he said. “Not since the Civil War has it been this bad. I believe that this is white supremacy’s last stand and Trump is their person out front.”
As a Black man, Johnson said it was inspiring to see thousands come out, many carrying signs decrying what they see as Trump’s and his allies’ racism. 
“This right here lets me know that we’re not alone, that people get what’s going on,” he said, adding that it was also a personal call to action.
“There aren’t enough African Americans down here. That lets me know that I have work to do in our community. That’s something I’m getting out of this.”
Stephanie Howard of Columbus said she was protesting “the fascist tactics and illegal actions of this administration around immigration, around free speech, around detaining American citizens and other people.”
She said Trump and his allies have reason to be concerned about the huge turnout for Saturday’s protests.
More than 10,000 are estimated to have gone to the Ohio Statehouse Saturday to protest the administration of Donald Trump.(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)
“They should be worried because this shows them that there are people eager to do something in a peaceful, constructive way,” Howard said. “The people are here and we are ready to push back. We don’t want to fight. We don’t want anyone to get hurt. But people are upset and angry and they are not going to put up with the administration and what it’s doing.”
Republicans, such as House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, called the protests “Hate America Rallies.” But organizers said the exact opposite was true.
“I heard someone was trying to say we’re unAmerican,” Mia Lewis, assistant director of Common Cause Ohio and a volunteer with Indivisible Central Ohio, said in a written statement. “Honestly, I can’t think of anything more powerfully American than a diverse group of free people exercising their rights, speaking truth to power, and refusing to bow down to a wannabe king!” 
Statewide action
Organizers in Central Ohio planned protests for earlier on Saturday in surrounding communities and then a 4 p.m. protest at the Statehouse in Columbus. In Newark, 35 miles east of Columbus, it appeared that more than 1,000 came out at noon to the Licking County Courthouse to show their distaste for Trump. 
They played music, chanted and almost made a ring around the courthouse as they marched around the sidewalk. 
A few cars sporting Trump flags drove around. In one, a passenger with a bullhorn taunted the crowd, saying they were being paid and had been bussed in. That provoked laughs.
When he said, “ICE is doing its job,” a protester shot back, “Yeah. Fascism.”
Steve Sunkle has spent his life in Newark. Asked if the size of the crowd surprised him, he said, “In this town, yes. You can’t even find a Democratic headquarters here.”

But, Sunkle said, sentiment seemed to be shifting.
“I think some of the elderly who voted for him are turning against him,” he said. “I live in an apartment building with 100 apartments. It’s hard to find a fan in that building right now.” 
He said inflation and threats to health care are reasons, “and people don’t like to see bombs being dropped on boats in the Caribbean without any proof. That’s not America. That’s the beginning of a totalitarian state.”
Diana Dudgeon stood with a sign that said “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren I did not stay silent.”
She has five grandchildren and has serious worries about the future.
“I’ve been thinking along these lines for awhile, because I’m 79 years old,” she said. “I won’t be around to see all the damage that’s being done. But my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, will. I just want them to know that I cared enough to try to do something.”
Attending her first protest, Dudgeon said she was surprised that she found it to be such a positive experience.
“This is awesome,” she said. “This is my first time. I feel very empowered. It’s so much more than I expected.” 
At the Statehouse later that day, Phillip Johnson said that was the point.
“They say fear is contagious, but so is courage,” he said. “People get a shot in the arm when they see this all over the world.”

The Louisville Democratic Party selected Gary Clemons, the president of the Steelworkers Local 1693, to run in a special election to fill the vacant seat in the 37th Senate District. 
In a Monday statement about Clemons’ nomination, the local party said he was selected unanimously by the nominating committee. 
“We are thrilled to have Gary representing Democrats in Senate District 37,” said Logan Gatti, the chair of the Louisville Democratic Party. “Gary is exactly the kind of leader Kentucky needs — grounded, community-driven and unafraid to fight for working families. He brings a wealth of experience, compassion and common sense to the table.” 
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg appointed Yates to serve an unexpired term as Jefferson County clerk earlier this month, following the death of Republican Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw. Yates had declared candidacy for that office earlier this year. 
Clemons also quickly received the backing of the Kentucky Democratic Party. Chairman Colmon Elridge issued a statement Monday morning in support of the union leader. 
“The Democratic Party has always been the party of working people and Gary Clemons is uniquely qualified to go fight for our families in the General Assembly,” Eldridge said. “At a time when too many Kentuckians are feeling the effects of a Republican-created cost-of-living and health care crisis, Gary’s decades of advocacy for fair wages, fair treatment and a more affordable life for working families will mean Louisvillians won’t just have a representative in Frankfort — they’ll have someone who understands their needs and continues to stand, and fight, alongside them.”
Michon Lindstrom, a spokesperson for the Kentucky secretary of state’s office said the deadline to file for the special election is Tuesday, Oct. 21. The election will be held Tuesday, Dec. 16. 
The deadline for voters in the Senate district to register and be eligible to vote in the election is Monday, Nov. 17. The district includes western parts of Jefferson County. 
The Jefferson County Republican Party did not immediately return an emailed request for comment Monday asking about a possible nomination for the special election. 
With Yates’ departure, Democrats hold five seats in the state Senate to Republicans’ 32 members.

(Photo courtesy of Merck)Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. is breaking ground on a $3 billion expansion of its longtime Elkton manufacturing campus, a project state and federal officials say will transform the Shenandoah Valley into a hub for life sciences innovation while adding as many as 500 permanent jobs.
The 400,000-square-foot facility will serve as Merck’s Center of Excellence for Pharmaceutical 
Ingredients and Small Molecule Manufacturing, marking a significant increase from the company’s earlier $2 billion commitment and 300-job projection. Construction is expected to begin this year and finish by 2029.
Company officials said the new site, which builds on nearly 85 years of Merck’s presence in Rockingham County, will enhance the production of small-molecule medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), adding cutting-edge testing and manufacturing capabilities.
“This investment will help advance our goal of providing new, innovative treatment options for people facing serious health challenges in the U.S. and around the world,” said Merck Chairman and CEO Robert Davis, calling the expansion a milestone “for Merck, for Virginia, for manufacturing in the United States and, most importantly, for the patients we serve.”
 State officials tout ‘transformational’ investment

Virginia leaders hailed the project as one of the largest single corporate investments in the state’s recent history.
“Merck’s transformational $3 billion commitment to locate its Center of Excellence marks a giant leap forward for both America’s and Virginia’s life sciences sector,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who called the project evidence of Virginia’s growing reputation as a leader in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Commerce and Trade Secretary Juan Pablo Segura said the project underscores the state’s “rapidly expanding biopharmaceutical sector,” crediting Virginia’s workforce and business-friendly policies for attracting large-scale investments.
Local officials called the expansion a turning point for the Valley’s economy.
“This announcement by Merck marks a momentous occasion for Rockingham County and the Shenandoah Valley,” said Shenandoah Valley Partnership Executive Director Jay Langston, adding that the project “positions the Valley at the forefront of a new class of pharmaceutical innovation.”
Rockingham County Board of Supervisors Chairman Joel Hensley said the expansion will “bring valuable jobs” and represents years of collaboration among local, state and company officials.
 Incentives and workforce training

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) worked with Rockingham County and the Shenandoah Valley Partnership to secure the deal. The state will provide a $5 million performance-based grant from the Virginia Investment Performance program and a $4 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to support site development.
Merck will also benefit from the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, which offers customized workforce recruitment and training services at no cost to qualified employers. The program, ranked as the nation’s top customized workforce training initiative by Business Facilities for three consecutive years, aligns with community colleges and universities to train workers to international standards.
“The expansion provides for more job opportunities and will further strengthen our local economy,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg. “Merck’s continued commitment to our community underscores the strength of our workforce.”
Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, called the project “truly transformative,” adding that Merck “has been a trusted partner to Rockingham County for many years, providing good-paying jobs and supporting our local economy.”
 Warner and Kaine praise expansion’s impact

U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats representing Virginia on Capitol Hill, also welcomed Merck’s investment and said it reflects the company’s long-term confidence in Virginia’s workforce and life sciences potential.
Warner noted that the company’s plan to bring most of its global small-molecule production to Elkton will “strengthen America’s pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity” and “reaffirm Virginia’s leadership in the life sciences sector.”
Warner also praised Merck for continuing to produce vaccines in Elkton, including its cancer-preventing Gardasil shot, at a time when “political attacks and misinformation are undermining trust in medicine and public health.”
Kaine, who helped expand Merck’s Elkton site during his term as governor, called the new investment “welcome news for Virginia’s economy.”
The senator also reflected on his role in including the Gardasil vaccine in Virginia’s immunization requirements during his tenure as governor, making the commonwealth the first state to do so. 
“Particularly as the Trump Administration sows doubt about the effectiveness of vaccines,” Kaine said, “it couldn’t be more important that we recognize and celebrate the impressive progress that Virginians and Merck have shared with the world.”
Warner and Kaine have both been involved in the facility’s growth over the past two decades. 
As governor, Warner secured a $40 million investment from Merck to prepare the Elkton site for vaccine production, and Kaine later helped secure another $57 million to expand its Gardasil operations.
In recent years, the senators have also pushed for greater federal investment in Virginia’s biotechnology research and manufacturing sector. 
In 2021, they helped secure more than $52 million under the American Rescue Plan for the Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster in Petersburg. Two years later, the Petersburg cluster was designated a Tech Hub under the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation Warner championed in Congress.
 Strengthening Virginia’s life sciences economy

Merck’s $3 billion project builds on the company’s nearly century-long presence in the Shenandoah Valley, where it has maintained major vaccine and drug manufacturing operations. 
Local officials said the scale of the project will create ripple effects across the Valley economy — from construction jobs to workforce training partnerships.
“This investment not only strengthens the regional economy through new jobs and capital investment but also positions the Valley at the forefront of a new class of pharmaceutical innovation,” said Langston of the Shenandoah Valley Partnership.

But when the system is repeatedly rigged to favor one side, that right quickly erodes. 
On October 13, North Carolina Republican leaders announced plans to vote on new United States House maps. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell), Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), and House Redistricting Chairs Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) and Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) openly stated that they are acting on instructions from President Donald Trump, aiming to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House in 2026. They claim Trump’s state win gives them a mandate to further manipulate an already unfair district map. 
If this new map is passed, it will be harder for voters to hold their representatives accountable, especially now that changing policies, like federal Medicaid cuts, are hurting many North Carolinians.  
This recent decision isn’t a one-time power grab. It is part of a years-long strategy to entrench partisan control through redistricting. As Senator Phil Berger posted on X on September 25, “We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats… If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.” 
Framing this as a partisan standoff is misleading. Let’s be clear: North Carolina maps have been repeatedly redrawn because courts found earlier versions violated constitutional protections against partisan and racial gerrymandering.   
You might have heard that our state has some of the most unfair Congressional maps in the country. What does that really mean? In North Carolina, Republican leaders have made a habit of manipulating district maps to make Congressional races less competitive. This tactic, known as gerrymandering, involves strategically drawing district lines to favor one party. One method of gerrymandering, called “cracking and packing,” involves diluting opposition votes across multiple districts and/or concentrating them into a single district to limit their influence. 
In 2022, North Carolina had a balanced 7-7 party split for the state’s 14 U.S. House seats. In 2024, after the adoption of a controversial new map, the state’s representation shifted dramatically to Republicans occupying 10 of 14 seats. Now, NC Republican leaders are targeting the state’s last remaining swing district with their proposed map, the 1st Congressional District (CD1) in the historic Black Belt, to undermine the freedom to vote and suppress Black voters.   
A vast majority of North Carolina voters reject the practice of gerrymandering, with 84 percent stating that it is never acceptable for politicians to manipulate district boundaries to benefit their own party. This opposition spans all political affiliations, including 78 percent of Republicans, 87 percent of Democrats, and 85 percent of unaffiliated voters. 
Eighty-two percent of voters also recognize the importance of judicial oversight in preventing racial discrimination in electoral maps, which is crucial given ongoing and past litigation. The case North Carolina NAACP v. Berger, recently consolidated with Williams v. Hall, will decide whether the state’s three electoral maps violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, due to possible racial discrimination against Black voters. This comes amid a federal court rejecting Jefferson Griffin’s baseless attempt to challenge the election of Allison Riggs to the NC Supreme Court in 2024—a major victory powered by voters’ organizing and advocacy.  
There is an alternative to these unfair maps, and we can look to our own state not too long ago for inspiration. In 2022, NC Supreme Court intervention prevented the use of gerrymandered maps and resulted in more competitive, fair elections in the midterms. Another option is the establishment of a bipartisan citizens commission to draw fair voting maps, which is supported by 70 percent of North Carolina voters. Such reforms would help ensure courts and voters, not politicians taking orders from partisan leaders, determine fair representation. 
At the ACLU-NC, we work in the legislature, courts, and communities to protect North Carolinians’ civil rights and liberties, including your right to vote in fair elections. While Senator Berger and Speaker Hall take orders from President Trump, we answer to North Carolinians because we are all CD1, united in the fight for fair representation.

Rankin County NAACP President Angela English said a Justice Department official recently  informed her that Attorney General Pam Bondi had authorized federal investigators to move forward with the Rankin County investigation after months of uncertainty about whether it would continue under the Trump administration. 
English has been coordinating with Justice Department officials since they began investigating the department in 2023, after a group of sheriff’s deputies and a Richland police officer, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” tortured two Black men during a late-night raid. 
Last year, the six officers were sentenced to federal prison for their roles in the incident, and dozens more people have since accused Rankin County deputies of abuse. 
“We need people to be held accountable for what they’re doing,” English said. “We need people to come forward and tell their own stories.”
After learning that the investigation would continue, English organized a listening session to help investigators connect with more alleged victims of the sheriff’s department.
The session will be held Nov. 1 at the Mount Elam Family Life Center in Pearl, where attendees will have an opportunity to share their experiences in private and submit their claims to the Justice Department.
“I have not seen where the Department of Justice has signaled anything regarding the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department,” said Jason Dare, the department’s attorney and spokesperson. “The RCSD will continue its cooperation with the investigation in order to show that all aspects of the department’s policing are within constitutional boundaries.” 
The Justice Department launched an investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department in September 2024, after Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a pattern of torture by Rankin deputies stretching back nearly two decades and involving at least 20 deputies. 
The federal agency did not respond to requests for comment on the investigation, but in July, it denied a Freedom of Information request filed by Mississippi Today seeking the status of its Rankin County investigation, saying the records “pertain to an ongoing law enforcement proceeding.” 
While the investigation had not formally been abandoned, its future was uncertain under the Trump administration, which has moved to scuttle most of the Justice Department’s ongoing investigations into law enforcement agencies accused of civil rights violations. 
In May, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division announced it was closing eight investigations into police departments in Arizona, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, Oklahoma and Louisiana. 
The division also dismissed lawsuits and investigations into the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, which were responsible for the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. 
Civil rights advocates said the sweeping changes signaled an end to the department’s longstanding practice of holding abusive law enforcement agencies accountable. 
“The Trump administration is essentially giving a green light to police abuse and unconstitutional policing,” Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, said in a May statement.
Survivors of the Goon Squad’s abuses said news of the investigation came as a relief. 
Rick Loveday, a former jail guard who said he was brutalized by Rankin County deputies when they raided his home in 2018, said he was excited to hear the Justice Department was continuing its investigation. 
“ They did a bunch of bad stuff,” Loveday said. “Fate caught up with some of them, but they still haven’t been punished, really, for what they’ve done.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28094225/IMG_0260.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office asked executive councilors and lawmakers on the state’s Fiscal Committee for an additional roughly $4.3 million to pay for litigation costs related to a number of lawsuits the state faced, including abuse allegations in the state’s juvenile justice system.
The funding is in addition to what the state Legislature budgeted for the Attorney General’s Office. However, it is typical for the office to request funding outside of the two-year budgeting process. State law specifically instructs the attorney general, unlike other state agencies, to spend more money than is budgeted for this purpose, with the approval of the Fiscal Committee and Executive Council.
“For the last decade-plus, that’s how our litigation fund has been run,” Attorney General John Formella told councilors during Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. “The Legislature budgets an amount that I think everyone understands is not going to be enough, and the plan is for us to have to do the work, try to figure out what we’re going to need for a particular fiscal year, come to the Fiscal Committee and the Governor and Council to ask them for it.”
This funding is meant to cover the costs the state incurs in litigating the cases, not any settlements it is ordered to pay out as a result of these cases.
Approximately $1.5 million of the $4.3 million is being used to litigate cases related to abuse at the former Youth Development Center, a juvenile justice facility in Manchester that has been the center of one of the largest child abuse scandals in U.S. history, Formella said.
Formella told councilors the $4.3 million is actually a cost-savings.
“I will note that we really worked hard to cut down on our request this fiscal year knowing the budget challenges the state is facing,” he said. “This is 40% less than we requested last fiscal year, and while that is in part due to just the cases, we’ve also been able to achieve some pretty significant savings by just spreading work around the office, taking some work from one area of the office and applying it to another area of the office.”
Both the Executive Council and the Fiscal Committee approved the funding.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/formella-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Facing an Oct. 31 deadline to adopt a new congressional redistricting map, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will meet for the first time this month on Tuesday.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s office sent out an official announcement last week, with the first meeting of the “reconstituted” commission scheduled for Oct. 21 at 9 a.m.
The commission will meet in the Ohio Senate’s Finance Hearing Room, where appointed officials will be noted for the record and co-chairpersons for the commission will be chosen.
Gov. Mike DeWine is constitutionally required to officially reconvene the group and stand as one of its members. Also on the commission will be Auditor of State Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, and two members each from the Ohio House and Senate, one from each party in each chamber.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio have both indicated they will be serving on the commission. State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, was announced as an appointee, but a Republican Senate appointee has not been announced as of Friday.
The last time the commission was reconvened, back in 2023, trying to decide on the two co-chairs delayed the commission in getting to the official agenda.
If the co-chairs are decided in Tuesday’s meeting, the agenda includes “consideration of congressional maps.” The only two confirmed proposals on the docket are the Democratic maps that were introduced by Antonio and Isaacsohn at the beginning of September.
Though the maps were introduced ahead of the first deadline set in the Ohio Constitution for the legislature to adopt a bipartisan-approved map, no votes were held by the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting. Several Republican members of the committee said the Democratic proposals were unfairly gerrymandered, while only one member of the public spoke out against the maps.
The committee heard hours of supporting testimony for the proposals over the two meetings it held. The Dem proposal would create a congressional delegation with eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts.
A Republican caucus map has not been publicly released.
Republican co-chairs of that joint committee argued the constitution’s deadlines include not only the Sept. 30 date that passed without a vote on a map and the Oct. 31 deadline for the Ohio Redistricting Commission, but also a final Nov. 30 legislative deadline, giving them more time than is being represented by anti-gerrymandering advocates, who argue the missed deadlines show a lack of good-faith effort.
If the commission isn’t able to come to bipartisan agreement on a map by Oct. 31, the General Assembly would only need a simple majority in the Republican supermajority chambers for a map to be approved. Lawmakers would have until Nov. 30 to come to a decision.
The map is required to be approved in time for the 2026 elections, meaning whatever is approved will have implications on imminent congressional races.

(Style Weekly)The University of Virginia declined to accept an offer from President Donald Trump‘s administration to sign an agreement granting federal funding and privileges in exchange for support of the administration’s policies, according to an Oct. 17 letter submitted to White House officials. Virginia lawmakers had denounced the proposal as “political extortion” and threatened to withhold state funding from the college if it accepted. 
In a statement to the institution’s community, UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney said he and Rector Rachel Sheridan wrote in the letter to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and White House officials that federal research funding should be based on merit while declining the invitation. 
“The integrity of science and other academic work requires merit-based assessment of research and scholarship,” the letter stated. “A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education.”
UVA was one of nine colleges nationwide that the administration asked to sign the compact, which requires school leaders to cap the number of international students in the Student Visa Exchange Program, forgo considering race and sex in admissions, bar transgender women from women’s athletics, freeze tuition for five years and limit university staff from political speech, all in exchange for research funding. Institutions had until Monday to respond.
Va. Senate Dems call Trump admin’s UVA funding proposal ‘political extortion’

Mahoney added that higher education faces “significant challenges” and has not always “lived up to its highest ideals.” Still, he said “UVA believes that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation.”
Over the past week, voices opposing the invitation to UVA grew louder, including from state Senate Democratic leadership and hundreds of students and staff who protested against it on Friday. Democratic senators warned that joining the compact could have a financial impact on the institution during future budget cycles.
The decision, which came after a demonstration on campus on Friday, followed UVA’s initiative to gather feedback from the community regarding the invitation. Additionally, a workgroup was formed to review the invitation before a response was submitted.
“Your thoughtful feedback shows a profound care for the university and a strong commitment to its future,” Mahoney wrote in the letter rejecting the compact.
He added “we will continue to work to strengthen free expression and free inquiry, protect academic freedom, ensure affordability, promote intellectual pluralism, and maintain institutional neutrality in an increasingly polarized world.”
UVA joins institutions like Brown University in Rhode Island, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California in declining the invitation, which critics say would undermine academic freedom and institutional independence.
According to media reports, the Trump administration is considering expanding the offer to more institutions.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)New Mexico Democratic U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján announced on Monday they had co-sponsored legislation backed by 31 Senate Democrats and sponsored by U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota to protect federal contractors during the governmental shutdown.
“Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House, but they refuse to come to the table and work with Democrats to lower costs and health care premiums. And every day Trump keeps the government shut down, New Mexico working families suffer,” Heinrich said in a statement.  “I’m proud to introduce legislation that will help ensure New Mexicans are paid for the wages and benefits lost during Trump’s manufactured crisis. Every hardworking New Mexican deserves access to affordable health care and the dignity of financial security.”
According to a news release, the Fair Pay for Federal Contractors Act will provide federal contract workers, “including low-wage service workers” with back pay and restored paid-leave benefits if used; cover costs associated with backpay in amounts equal to their weekly compensation up to $1,442; and require the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to submit a report on federal contractors accessing back pay.
“Federal contractors, like those from the Department of Energy and Department of Defense that are safeguarding our national security, should not miss a paycheck because of the Republican shutdown,” Luján said in a statement. “These skilled workers are essential for our defense and innovation, and they deserve the same backpay protections as other federal employees. It’s time to right this wrong, and I will fight to ensure that contractors are paid for what they have earned.”
The bill also has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, where is is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA); New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury has signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill has endorsements from numerous unions, including and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
“Through no fault of their own, many of these families faced the reality of missing payments on their mortgages, student loans, school tuition, car loans, health care premiums, daycare, interest fees, and so many other expenses,” IAM Union International President Brian Bryant wrote to lawmakers in the House and Senate. “Today, they are looking down the barrel of a similar fate. Contract workers and their families should not suffer the consequences of a shutdown they had no hand in creating. Dedicated federal contract workers maintain the aircraft, vehicles and systems that keep our military mission-ready and our nation secure. Many live paycheck to paycheck and are among the first to feel the devastating impact of a government shutdown.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/arboretumclosed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 12:04:20.125190

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)LAFAYETTE – As its full-time undergraduate enrollment steadily declined over the past decade, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette nonetheless went on a hiring spree.
UL’s full-time undergraduate enrollment — where it makes the most money, as each student generates about $12,000 per year — declined by 1,700 students since 2015. That resulted in a $20 million loss in revenue. While its online and graduate student numbers ticked up during that period, it wasn’t enough to make the university whole.
“They are the students who really pay the bills,” interim UL President Jaimie Hebert told faculty and staff at his Sept. 25 town hall meeting, the first time the university has publicly addressed the budget shortfall.
Despite that downward trend developing in plain sight, the university’s hiring nevertheless continued on an upward trajectory, with 554 positions created from 2015 to March of this year. Because each new position means recurring costs like salary, benefits, retirement, space and administrative overhead, the hiring added $60 million to UL’s budget over that period, Hebert said.

Those rising cost commitments, according to Hebert, are part of the reason the university is scrambling to close a $25 million deficit, and staring down unknown levels of personnel cuts. So far, only six job losses and the closing of the sustainability office have been confirmed.
The annual job additions are not uniform, as some years saw more hiring than others. Data that UL provided in response to a public records request supports Hebert’s assertion that staffing increased — but it doesn’t show how the new hires were justified, for instance to support a growing program or expand research.
In 2018, hiring spiked. It then fell for the next three years before rebounding to previous levels during the post-Covid years of 2022 and 2023, right after UL first earned the prestigious R1 research designation. The numbers declined in 2024, and last fall notifications started going out to faculty and staff about cost-cutting measures.

UL wasn’t able to offer any analysis of the numbers it provided.
“We’d have to do a real deep dive to see where those people were hired. Some of them may have been part of a grant that was given” that allowed for new hires, says UL spokesman Eric Maron.
“We can’t really say whether R1 has anything to do with anything,” Maron added. “There can be peaks and valleys.”
In its response to The Current, UL indicated that 87 of those 554 newly created positions are unfilled, leaving a net of 467 positions. UL provided a list of the deleted positions.
UL enrolled its largest freshman class to date this fall and saw overall enrollment grow from last year.

Few areas of modern American popular culture have undergone greater or more rapid changes in recent years that college sports. Thanks to a series of successful legal challenges, the nation’s longstanding practice of treating college athletes as amateurs has been completely upended and, especially at big schools engaged high-profile sports like football and basketball, teams have become professionalized, with many athletes switching schools yearly, and raking in multi-million dollar deals under so-called “name image and likeness.”
In a time of such rapid change and upheaval, it comes as little surprise that many people who were used to how things once worked – be they university leaders or average citizens and sports fans — are experiencing a sense of disorientation and discomfort. And this fact was made clear in some recent opinion surveys conducted by the Elon University Poll and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, and recently Newsline caught up with the Elon poll director, Prof. Jason Husser, to learn more.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation Husser, we discussed some of the results of the recent opinion surveys of university leaders he oversaw on the subject of the rapid changes that have been underway in college athletics – particularly the professionalization of once amateur sports and the newfound ability athletes enjoy to transfer from school-to-school.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of these issues, the concerns that many university leaders have about how these changes are impacting low revenue sports, and, in addition, how these views compare and contrast to what a poll conducted this past summer revealed about the attitudes of the general public.

Over the last several decades, much of the world has made significant progress in how it views and responds to the affliction we’ve come to refer to as substance use disorder. Whereas people who once struggled with the misuse of and addiction to drugs and alcohol were once dismissed as weak and flawed, we’ve learned that substance use disorder is an illness not unlike many others that can and should give rise to treatment rather than judgment and ostracization.
A recent lawsuit settlement should help advance this ongoing piece of societal progress. The case involved a pair of North Carolina skilled nursing facilities that sought to deny admission to an individual in violation of multiple federal laws because of his substance use disorder and recent drug use. The case settlement requires the facilities to develop and implement a Substance Use Disorder Non-Discrimination Policy and to implement several other modern, medically sound policies and recently, in order to learn more, we caught up with a pair of attorneys from the nonprofit that helped spearhead the case, Disability Rights North Carolina: Holly Stiles and Sara Harrington.

More trans youth and their families are expected to seek gender-affirming care and community support following two New Hampshire laws that restricted access for minors. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont positioned to become gender-affirming care haven for New Hampshire families.","When Michelle purchased her house in a small town near Keene in 2017, she thought she would never leave. Yet, less than a decade later, she was back to house hunting and saying goodbye to the wide porch and the basement apartment that she so loved in her New Hampshire home.
“I thought that we would be there for a very long time,” she told VTDigger. “I literally cried the day of the closing, and I had such a hard time just walking out that last day,” 
By February, staying in New Hampshire with her 18-year-old transgender daughter seemed far scarier than leaving, said Michelle, who moved to Vermont early this year. VTDigger is not using her last name to protect her and her daughter’s safety.
Two bills effectively blocking gender-affirming care in the state for any new patients under 18 were then working their way through the New Hampshire Legislature. In August, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed them into law, making New Hampshire the first state in New England to set such limits. Even before that, though, in 2024, a ban on genital surgery for minors became state law.
One of the new state laws prohibits health care providers in New Hampshire from administering puberty blockers or hormone treatments to new patients under 18 — though patients receiving that care before January 1, 2026, can continue it. (It is still legal for adults to access this care in the state.) The second law blocks New Hampshire doctors from performing “breast surgeries” on minors.
But months before the state legislature passed the 2025 bills, Michelle and her family members saw the writing on the wall.
Anti-trans rhetoric was mounting in the state legislature and had only only gotten worse through the 2024 presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. They no longer felt at home in their dream house. 
When a neighbor posted an Ayotte for New Hampshire lawn sign, it felt targeted against them. Michelle said her daughter told her then, “Mama, I don’t feel safe in our neighborhood.”
“I was just devastated. I knew that what was going to happen this year was not going to be pretty, and I needed to get our family out of New Hampshire,” Michelle said. 
The night of the election felt like the final nail in the coffin, she said, with wins called for Republicans Donald Trump and Ayotte. At 2 a.m., her daughter texted her from another room, saying “we need to leave the country.” 
Instead, Michelle and her spouse immediately put their house on the market and started looking for homes in Massachusetts and Vermont. When she found the Washington County home she now lives in, she jumped. 
They moved to Vermont before Valentine’s Day. “When I looked across the street and saw a pride flag, I felt like this was it,” she said.

Affirming care in Vermont
Michelle’s family is not alone in their desire to move to a state they perceive to be more accepting for trans youth. 
Beyond New Hampshire, bans on gender-affirming care for minors are active in 25 other states. All of these were effectively upheld in June by a Supreme Court decision that determined a Tennessee law blocking gender-affirming care is not unconstitutional, which health care providers expect to drive many young people across state lines seeking care. 
The tenor at the federal level has had a chilling effect on some larger health care providers who are also closing their clinics, even in states without bans. This past summer, Yale Connecticut Children’s Medical Center announced it was ending its gender-affirming care program in light of federal pressures, and Yale New Haven Hospital stopped providing hormone treatment to minors. Though Connecticut law still protects the care, the closures have de-facto cut the state off from local access to it. In Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Penn State Health similarly opted to end gender-affirming care for minors, cutting off a large portion of the state from this care. 
Unlike in some other states, New Hampshire’s law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, 2026, still allows providers to refer patients under 18 for care out of state. As a result, advocates and clinics in Vermont say they are expecting an influx of new patients either moving or traveling from states with more restrictive access to gender-affirming care for minors. 
“We are fortunate in this region that patients may seek care nearby in neighboring states for the time being, but that remains a hardship for many due to travel and insurance hurdles,” Keith Loud, the physician-in-chief of the network of pediatric care across Dartmouth Health Children’s hospitals and clinics, said in a statement to VTDigger about the new laws. Loud noted that gender-affirming care is broader than just hormonal therapies and surgeries, and that the Dartmouth Health patients will still be able to seek support from their doctors, for referrals or other therapeutic expertise.

“There will certainly be an increase of families that are looking to move to places where there’s a different level of care, whether that’s (from) New Hampshire or whether that’s Texas or Indiana,” said Dana Kaplan, the executive director of Outright VT, a group that aims to support LGBTQ+ youth in the state.
“We’ve already seen that start, and we anticipate that it will only continue,” he said, “which is just another reason to make sure that in Vermont, we’re not backing down and we’re staying out in front as a national leader.” 
Vermont’s shield laws, passed in 2023, offer protections to providers and recipients of gender-affirming care and establish the care as an essential part of the standards of care a health insurance plan should cover. Also, denying a patient gender-affirming care would be a violation of the state’s anti discrimination laws, as Monica Allard, a lawyer with the ACLU of Vermont, told VTDigger.
University of Vermont Medical Center’s Transgender Youth Program remains the primary place in the state for young people to access gender-affirming healthcare. The hospital and the clinic have seen an uptick in inquiries from patients in other states, said UVM Medical Center spokesperson Annie Mackin. So far the clinic has mostly received calls from patients in New Hampshire, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, trying to make a plan for where they can go for care, Mackin said. 
The clinic is prepared to receive these patients when they do come, said Jason Williams, the head of communications for UVM Medical Center, in an interview. They should be able to see a clinician within a few weeks of scheduling, he said.
“We don’t think we will have to immediately change. We’ve got all the people and all the expertise,” Williams said. 
Patients at the UVM Medical Center’s clinic can meet with a therapist or psychologist or a pediatric endocrinologist to access hormonal interventions like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy. For surgical care, patients are referred out of state, Williams said. 
PlannedParenthood of New England is also able to provide hormone replacement therapies to those above 16 years old. The population of 16 and 17 year olds who do seek gender-affirming care at PPNE are less than 1% of the provider’s patient population. 
Jessica Barquist, a spokesperson for PPNE, said that the provider has not seen a “significant influx” of patients into Vermont yet, but expects that it will come in January, when the New Hampshire laws go into effect. Because trans minors are such a small percentage of those the organization serves, Barquist said she expects the clinics to be able to easily accommodate the influx with their existing resources and schedules. 
The organization also runs a donor supported fund for gender-affirming care patients as a way to reduce barriers to care, Barquist said.
In addition to medical resources, Outright Vermont offers an extensive list of where to find items that young queer people may need, like chest binders or specialty providers, as well as places to gather with a supportive community.
Connecting young people with the health care that affirms their gender identity, that makes them feel seen and respected and even celebrated “is life altering,” said Kaplan, with OutrightVT. “It really is life changing.”

An ‘innermost sense of belonging’
The way Kaplan sees it, support for trans and queer youth that isn’t so explicitly medical is also crucial care. “There’s a continuous barrage of messages that target LGBTQ youth, telling them that they’re not valued, cared for, allowed to exist,” he said.
That support includes events like Outright’s summer camp and Friday night social support group, which aim to help kids connect both with their peers and with themselves, Kaplan said. Or the support could be information like resource toolkits for parents and family members or peer groups like a Gay-Straight Alliance club at school.  
“What we’re trying to do is really take that narrative (of difference) and say who you are is a superpower,” said Kaplan. “Through connecting to other people and realizing that there’s a larger community here and that there’s something joyful about being yourself.” 
Understanding their identity as a source of inner strength “creates a world of possibilities for young people,” he added. That sense of power and community can also be life-saving.
“Your innermost sense of belonging is the biggest predictor and a protective factor against suicide,” Kaplan said. 
Nationally, queer youth are four times more likely to to attempt suicide than their peers. In Vermont, 50% of trans youth and nonbinary people  “seriously considered” suicide in 2023, according to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, a percentage slightly higher than the national trend of 46%.
For Michelle and her daughter, those statistics hit particularly close to home. When her daughter was 16, she started experiencing chronic migraines that ultimately led her to shift to homeschooling.
“It was like a light went out, and she just started to get a headache that was just literally constant. Looking back, I know now it wasn’t just a typical migraine. It was a lot of internal stress that she wasn’t really able to express,” Michelle said of her daughter, who had not yet begun her transition at that time.
Nearly a year later, Michelle’s daughter attempted suicide. Soon after that, she raised the possibility of hormone replacement therapy to her mother.
“I obviously was all ears at that point,” Michelle said, describing still feeling raw from the experience of nearly losing her child. She doesn’t think that a person’s status as a minor should interfere with whether they can access gender-affirming care. 
“I’m not going to just say, ‘Well, I’m sorry, you’re 17’ and have her then go ahead and actually attempt suicide again and maybe possibly be successful in that attempt,” she said.
‘Room to do more’
Michelle’s daughter still struggles with her mental health and feelings of isolation here in Vermont but is buoyed by looking forward to her upcoming gender-affirming surgery next year, Michelle said.
As the family has settled into their new home, the harsh tenor of the national discussion about transgender people has only become more heightened. Michelle and her daughter both still feel a near-paralyzing anxiety over the rhetorical attacks on both trans children and adults. Many days, Michelle said, it keeps her daughter from leaving her room. 
Her daughter’s experience underscores a reality for many queer youth in Vermont, Kaplan said. Even though the state has strong laws and access to gender-affirming care and support, it can still be a lonely place to find yourself.
“In a rural state like Vermont or New Hampshire, isolation is a real thing. It can run really deep. It separates young people from each other, and it also makes it harder to access information and resources,” he said. 
“In Vermont, we are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place where there’s this sense of ‘Well, we’re so progressive. We are above and beyond so many other places. We’re not New Hampshire.’ I think that that can be a dangerous place for us to be,” he added. “There’s definitely room for us to do more.”

Those efforts to provide a deeper sense of belonging for queer youth in Vermont are currently overshadowed by the federal government’s efforts to limit access to gender-affirming care nationwide. Though care remains available, Vermont hospitals, clinics and providers are carefully tracking any proposed changes to federal regulations that might affect access and considering how to respond.
In spite of the challenges at the federal level, Michelle said she and her daughter have felt a broadly more welcoming atmosphere in the Green Mountain State. 
“It feels like there are more safe places in Vermont,” she said. “I’ve taken my daughter to have some piercings, and she felt incredibly welcome in the piercing studio. We went to have her first haircut in Vermont, and I literally took a huge sigh of relief when I walked into the stylist salon.” 
It was the first time she can remember that the place she was taking her daughter for a haircut felt completely safe, she said. “That’s really a simple thing for a parent, to be able to take your kids somewhere and get their hair cut.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”
Shah’s role with the U.S. CDC placed him as the agency’s second in command, but having been put in that position by the Biden administration, he returned to Maine after Trump was elected to his second term. Currently, Shah lives in Brunswick and works as a visiting professor at Colby College in Waterville. 
“The challenges facing our state require a leader with a different skill set to bring Mainers more than they have today,” Shah said. “I’ve run organizations with tens of thousands of employees and managed multi-billion dollar budgets by being curious, asking tough questions, and demanding accountability. As governor, I will run toward tough problems, not away from them.”
Shah became a household name during the pandemic, but he will face plenty of other candidates with name recognition in the Democratic gubernatorial primary next June. This includes current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, former head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future Hannah Pingree, as well as businessman Angus King III, son of Maine’s sitting U.S. senator. 
With outgoing Gov. Janet Mills termed out and looking to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the open governor’s seat is drawing candidates from a variety of backgrounds and political identities. Multiple current legislators have also thrown their hats into the ring, including Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford and Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland, who have both shed their former party affiliations to run as independents. 
Earlier this month, Jonathan Bush, the nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush announced his bid as a Republican candidate, joining more than a half dozen other candidates vying for the GOP nomination.

The American South has the highest HIV rates in the country, accounting for more than half of new HIV diagnoses nationwide in 2023. This is despite growing availability of a highly effective HIV prevention medication that has made it possible to live a long, healthy life with this once fatal disease.
This medication – called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP – reduces the risk of HIV transmission by over 99% when taken as prescribed. Yet, in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, one of the most vulnerable populations – Black men who have sex with men – are rarely using it, with fewer than 1 in 5 who are eligible taking the drug.
The Trump administration has previously frozen and proposed more cuts to HIV prevention programs in the U.S. And although the administration has restored some of the federal webpages and datasets it took down in January 2025, it is unclear what information remains missing or has changed. Communities in the South that already face the highest burden of infection will feel the greatest effects of changing public health priorities.
In my work as a public health researcher, I have spent years studying HIV prevention and the social determinants of health in the Deep South. Through interviews with health care providers and Black patients in major Southern cities, what I learned was that a powerful clash between culture and public health plays a significant role in why effective medical treatments are still failing to reach those who need it most. I call this tension the Southern paradox – where medical solutions exist but systemic forces block access.
The stories of these clinicians and patients in the South weren’t simply about a pill: They were about trust, identity, family and faith. And their words highlighted a complex web of emotions and experiences that often go unaddressed in standard health messaging.
 Southern culture and sexual health

In my recent study, I interviewed 12 people in Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta: eight Black men who have sex with men, along with four health care providers. Three of these providers also identified as men who have sex with men.
Many participants reported that physical access to PrEP wasn’t the issue. Instead, what stood in the way was far more personal and deeply embedded in their environment.
“In church, you’re taught to love your neighbor, but there’s always an asterisk when it comes to who you love,” one participant from Jackson told me. “If you’re gay, you’re either ignored or silently judged.”
Nearly all participants described the South as a place deeply shaped by conservative values, especially those rooted in religion and traditional family structures. The Black church emerged as both a protective factor and a challenge. While offering vital community support, it also often reinforced stigma around homosexuality and discouraged open conversations about sexual health.
One participant from New Orleans shared that he heard about PrEP from his health care provider and his friends, while another from Atlanta recalled learning about PrEP during his annual physical. Despite repeatedly being exposed to information about PrEP, both described hesitation about starting treatment. One worried about potential stigma if others discovered he was taking it, while the other questioned whether he “really needed” it. Ultimately, neither had started PrEP.
In many of these communities, sex education in schools is still focused on abstinence and often excludes LGBTQ+ topics entirely. “You grow up not hearing anything about gay sex or HIV,” one man from Memphis said. “So, when you get older, it’s like starting from scratch.”
Even decisions around condom use were heavily shaped by cultural norms. Men described relying on partner trust, age or perceived cleanliness rather than research-based ways to reduce the risk of HIV.
This absence of comprehensive, inclusive sex education leaves many vulnerable to misinformation and, ultimately, to preventable infections.
 Trust is the real barrier

One of the most striking findings from these conversations was the deep mistrust that many Black men who have sex with men feel toward the health care system.
“It’s hard to find affirming care for people in the queer community,” said one Memphis-based health provider. Others talked about fears of being “outed” through their insurance, especially if they were still on a family health plan.
A Jackson-based participant confided, “Some people avoid taking [PrEP] because for each prescription you are required to be evaluated. Some people don’t want the follow-up or the screening.” Another noted how fear of both outright and subtle judgment during medical appointments made it easier to avoid health care altogether.
Systemic racism compounds these concerns. For many Black men, historical and ongoing experiences of discrimination, including rushed visits, lack of empathy, misdiagnoses and even being denied care altogether have built a lasting sense of caution.
Even when resources like PrEP are available, these treatments often feel inaccessible to Black men because they do not trust the system offering them.
 Social networks step in

Thankfully, these conversations also uncovered moments of hope.
Many participants learned about PrEP from peers. “We talk about it regularly,” said one participant in Jackson. “I have friends who work in public health, along with friends who are taking the medication.”
In the South, where community ties often serve as critical safety nets, these social networks can sometimes provide more trusted health information than clinics or campaigns. Informal conversations in group chats, at house parties or during community gatherings often serve as powerful platforms for health promotion.
One provider in Atlanta said he intentionally shared his own experiences with PrEP to reduce stigma. “I have a little soreness,” he said with a smile, referring to a recent injection. “Then I tell everyone, ‘Yup, I just got mine.’ The casualness of that comment made a difference: It made PrEP feel normal, relatable, something for ‘us,’ not something done to ‘them.’”
These social exchanges, rooted in trust and shared experience, frequently did more to shift attitudes than traditional public health campaigns. As one participant put it, “I trust my friends more than those ads. If they’re taking it and it works for them, that means something to me.”
 Making PrEP culturally relevant

What these conversations show is that for PrEP to work in the South, access to treatment is only part of the equation. Building trust, cultural affirmation and community-led education are equally critical.
Public health messages that go beyond medical facts and address the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of health are more likely to build lasting engagement with HIV prevention. This includes investing in Black, LGBTQ+-affirming health care providers who reflect the communities they serve. It also means integrating discussions of sexual health into everyday conversations at barbershops, churches and community centers, not just in clinics.
Public health officials and clinicians can explore alternative treatment delivery methods that address privacy concerns, such as telehealth PrEP programs, discreet mail-order services and community-based distribution points. These can make PrEP easier to access and reduce the stigma associated with clinic visits.
Most importantly, valuing the knowledge already circulating within communities and supporting peer educators as legitimate public health messengers can strengthen credibility, normalize PrEP and empower people to take charge of their health.
In the battle against HIV in the South, culture is not just a barrier. It can also be the solution. I believe that when care is offered in a way that honors people’s identities, experiences and values, it becomes not just accessible but empowering.

Singing songs and carrying signs, rally goers gathered in Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, Lander, Cody, Torrington, Pinedale, Gillette, Worland, Sheridan, Rock Springs and Jackson in crowds some estimated to be as large as 500 or so. The protesters challenged what they see as Trump’s consolidation of power, erosion of democratic checks and balances, and authoritarian acts.
“No kings! No kings!” many chanted, some recalling the land’s last king — George III — and the 1776 revolution that showed him the door.

Little Snake River Valley folk traveled from Baggs to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to join a mile-long line of protesters, according to a post on the Wyoming Democratic Party’s Facebook page. A social media post from Riverside, population 66, showed four protesters — some 6% of the inhabitants, not counting the photographer.
Signs ran the gamut.
“Love everyone, save our democracy.” “ The only orange monarch we want is a butterfly.” “I heart America.” “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism.” “Don’t tread on our democracy.” “Hate will never make America great.” “No faux-king way.”
In Jackson, Jenny Landgraf’s inflatable costume had her riding a giant chicken while she carried a sign, “A president most fowl.” Other inflatable costumes, apparently intended to counter notions that the gatherings might be riotous, included dinosaurs, cartoon characters, frogs, a raccoon and a person in a pickle suit.
“We are in a pickle,” read their sign.

A large inflatable red Jeff Koons balloon dog carried a placard declaring “Nobody is eating the dogs,” pushing back against Trump’s claim that Haitian immigrants were eating pets. 
On the contrary
On Thursday before the rallies, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso called the planned protests “radical” and “anti-American.” He spoke in the Senate.
Democrats are beholden to far-left activist groups with names like “hashtag resist Trump” and “American Atheists,” he said. “All will be calling on the Democrats to keep the government closed.”

Barrasso echoed House Speaker Mike Johnson, saying some are calling the protests “I hate America” rallies.
“On the contrary,” said former Wyoming Rep. Andy Schwartz of Teton County. “I saw people loving America and showing their commitment to the ideals established 250 years ago.”
He carried a sign near Jackson’s elk-antler arches that read “We the people,” and was decorated with American flags.
“It’s not perfect,” Schwartz said of the country’s record of achieving its ideals, “but we are getting a glimpse of what an alternative looks like.”
Fox News reported roughly 2,500 protests across the country with only a few arrests. Organizers estimated 7 million people rallied nationwide. Strength in Numbers, an independent data-driven political-analysis Substack column, calculated a median number of participants at 5.2 million with a high estimate of 8.2 million.
Author G. Elliott Morris headlined his conclusion that the No Kings Day saw “the largest single-day political protest ever.*” The asterisk notes that 1970s Earth Day events, not necessarily political and arranged much further in advance than No Kings, had more participants.

Please contact a member of the family if you would like a link to a video conference gathering to celebrate Sally later this year, or for Sally’s instructions on preparing oatmeal properly.

Sally Martyn Lacy of Jericho, Vermont, died on October 17th at the age of 97. Born in Cleveland Ohio to Herbert Vivian Martyn and Frances Dunham Martyn, Sally soon demonstrated her innate curiosity for plants and animals, riding her beloved horse Lucky, and drawing and making notations about what she saw in nature. Even with that love of the outdoors, she treasured the family lace and china left to her by British and Welsh ancestors.
Sally attended Wellesley (B.A.) and Harvard (M.Ed) and in 1955 married MIT man Thomas Bowditch Lacy. They raised their family and many pets in Brookside, New Jersey. Sally briefly worked as a special education teacher but her true callings were as animal portrait artist and advocate for working border collies. In addition to commissioned animal portraits, her pastels of the first giant panda pair from China at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in 1972 were shown in New York galleries.
Her love of equestrian dressage began in New Jersey when she acquired a frisky thoroughbred horse. Sally was also active in the League of Women Voters and was the local grammarian and unofficial wildlife rescue center. 
Her first border collie Keswick inspired Sally’s 70-year commitment to the breed. She was drawn to Scotland to study the intelligence and instinct of working border collies and their relationship with their shepherds. When Tom’s job transferred to southern Ohio, they bought enough land to keep sheep and put the dogs to work. Sally became a skilled dog handler and ably competed in sheepdog trials throughout the U.S. and Canada. She was the first woman to compete against men in the United States Border Collie Handlers Association (USBCHA) National Finals. 
Sally chaired the genetics committee of The New England Border Collie Association (NEBCA) and coordinated countless clinics to screen potential breeding dogs for Collie Eye Anomaly. Dedicated to breeding based on herding instinct and talent rather than on a physical standard, Sally unsuccessfully campaigned to stop the American Kennel Club (AKC) from recognizing the breed.
Sally and Tom retired to Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, where she continued to breed sheep and border collies with an eye towards building her success on the trial field. She supported many novice handlers by sponsoring training clinics with Scottish herding masters and still managed to marry farm life with really good tea, NPR, twice-cooked Scottish oatmeal, and visits to the Boston Symphony. 
After Tom’s death, Sally moved to Jericho Vermont, where, at 86, she traded in her large dog-trial-ready RV camper for a Connemara pony named Hope. She credited Hope for her recovery from a serious stroke in 2021. In 2022, with a combined age of 115, Sally and Hope completed the Century Club Ride, a judged dressage test for owner-horse pairs whose combined ages surpass 100. With concerns for her pony’s future, she donated Hope to a children’s riding academy in southern Vermont, and had one last ride on her 95th birthday. 
Sally is predeceased by husband Thomas Bowditch Lacy, brother William Dunham Martyn, and nephews David Lacy and Peter Martyn. She is survived by her children Charles Martyn Lacy (Gaye Symington), Paul Matthews Lacy, Kathryn Lacy Marshall (David Marshall); grandchildren Emily Marshall (Will Matthews), Samuel Lacy (Carmen Lacy), Mary Lacy (Paul Coyne), Benjamin Marshall (Sarah Sandhaus), and Thomas Lacy of Jericho; great-grandchild Parker Marshall; numerous nieces and nephews, and her close friend and co-adventurer, Lorna McMaster.
Sally also leaves behind many friends and admirers from Westford and Colchester stables and her Jericho Center, West Bolton, and Underhill community.  Over the past summer and fall, Jean, Bradlee, Margot, Bernie and Maeve, Kellianna, Faith, Jen, Katie, Patty and many others emailed and visited her, sharing with her their observations, photographs and poetry describing bees, insects, birds, deer, flowers, and other wonders from the wetlands, woods, gardens, and trails they were exploring. Sally so appreciated seeing that familiar natural world through their eyes.
In addition to friends and neighbors, the Lacy family appreciates the care and support provided by Dr. Marie Sandoval and the skilled and caring staff at Home Care Assistance of Vermont, Mansfield Place in Essex, and UVM Home Health and Hospice.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Katie Batza’s first memory of HIV and AIDS was as a pre-teen church volunteer helping her mother deliver Meals on Wheels to a man facing death.
She was 11 years old and her politically conservative Catholic mother was dedicated to making certain those struck by the pandemic were treated with kindness, empathy and love.
HIV and AIDS, first recognized in the early 1980s, emerged as a lethal disease most commonly contracted by men having sex or addicts sharing needles to do drugs. The disease’s learning curve meant it was common for people to mistakenly believe the virus could be contracted by touch. Doctors and nurses were scared to treat the sick. The general public was profoundly alarmed. In partisan circles, AIDS was a vehicle of political attack.



“We were in charge of visiting this young man with HIV, who was in hospice,” Batza said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “My mom really wanted to make sure … that the person felt like we weren’t afraid of him, that we could be friends with him. To try and be gentle to him in the final, you know, weeks and months of his life.”
She put aside medical trappings of a life ebbing away, and would sit with him, play Legos and chat.
“I learned that his family wasn’t speaking to him and he was relying on people like my mom to kind of help him in the final weeks,” Batza said. “It was a formative memory for sure.”
Afterward, she found reason to explore shelves of the library to learn about LGBTQ+ history. She was deeply disappointed by the lean offerings.
“In that moment, I thought, ‘This isn’t right. This isn’t good. I need to figure out how to fill this bookshelf,'” Batza said.
 
Heartland answers
Decades later, Batza has become a researcher, writer and teacher on the history of this breathtaking disease estimated to have taken more than 40 million lives worldwide so far.
Batza, associate professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at University of Kansas, recently published “AIDS in the Heartland: How Unlikely Coalitions Created a Blueprint for LGBTQ Politics.” It explores the pandemic from perspectives of family, friends and others who grappled with AIDS far from population epicenters for the disease in San Francisco or New York City.
Library shelves aren’t as bare as they once were, but Batza said there was a need to help fill gaps in medical, religious, social, economic and political history of AIDS in the heartland.
“Even historians who study HIV and AIDS, they kind of gloss over the middle part of the country as a place that was really not impacted,” Batza said. “That does a huge disservice for the history that is here, as well as the people that are here fighting to make sure that the AIDS epidemic doesn’t kind of rear its ugly head again.”
For the book, she was able to draw upon oral histories, interviews and archived material at KU.
She discovered religious organizations were key in regions of the country that didn’t have a large social safety net to serve the mostly gay men struck down by HIV and AIDS. Grassroots systems did emerge in Kansas and elsewhere, she said.
“There were several of the people that I interviewed for this book who said without religious organizations there would not have been a response to HIV in this region,” she said. “Churches, synagogues, convents, these are all places that kind of had resources, whether it’s church vans or extra rooms in the convent.”
In Topeka, Westboro Baptist Church led by the late Rev. Fred Phelps offered Kansas a unique and tragic response. Phelps’ followers picketed funerals of people suspected of dying of AIDS. They sang abusive songs, hoisted disrespectful signs and stomped on the U.S. flag. Their funeral picketing was challenged in court and declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Some of Fred Phelps’ people still kind of haunt the hills of Kansas,” Batza said.
She said Wesboro’s confrontational style fostered the formation of unlikely coalitions in the Midwest.
“You saw drag queens and motorcyclists kind of use their motorcycle engines to rev out the noise and drag queens would make these elaborate costumes with big wings to visually block off the protesters,” Batza said.
 
Hearts and minds
She said in less densely populated areas of the country there was cross-pollination of activists. In some instances, the same people in a community were involved with a series of health care, housing, transportation or religious organizations. It was amazing to seek how personal connections created a holistic approach to the HIV and AIDS crisis that wasn’t matched in bigger cities, she said.
In terms of heartland medical care for people with HIV or AIDS, there was no mirroring New York City or San Francisco where wings of hospitals were devoted to this pandemic.
Kansas did have Donna Sweet, a renowned Wichita physician who in the early 1980s was one of the first doctors in Kansas to treat patients with HIV and AIDS.
She cared for patients all over the state and led initiatives to educate others about a disease that has been transformed over the decades from an almost certain death to a preventable disease that also can be treated as a chronic health condition.
“She would literally work with farmers to find crop dusters who could pick her up and take her to farms and fields so that neighbors didn’t necessarily have to know what was happening,” Batza said. “She really did the work of changing the hearts and minds of people, you know, one person at a time. I think that kind of really grassroots effort of educating can’t be overstated.”
 
Politicized immediately
Batza, who is in her 12th year at KU, said this generation of college students know what a pandemic looks like after experiencing COVID-19. But many students have shared their dismay at hostility directed at people suffering HIV or AIDS, she said.
It can be difficult to contemplate that men and women with such a debilitating disease were abandoned by their families and friends or that hospital personnel were afraid to touch them or deliver food to them.
“It’s really a big ask for them to grasp the full scope of the early HIV-AIDS crisis,” she said. “They did not comprehend the extent of the stigma and the fact that people could get kicked out of their jobs and houses.”
In hindsight, it was inevitable HIV and AIDS would be political dynamite.
“An epidemic of any kind becomes politicized almost immediately,” she said. “Deploying shame as a political tactic … was pretty helpful for some people who were in politics at the time. But as a public health strategy, obviously, it’s proven to have failed several times over, because in ostracizing people, you’re not willing to talk about how transmission happens, how to prevent it from spreading to more people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Katie-Batza-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

(Steph Quinn | Missouri Independent)Missouri has lost nearly 1.6 million pounds of food aid since May due to sudden cuts to a federal program that buys food from U.S. farmers and sends it to food banks across the country.
That’s 146,400 pounds of cheese, 433,070 pounds of canned and frozen chicken, 1.2 million eggs, 38,250 gallons of milk, 120,000 pounds of pulled pork, 115,200 pounds of sliced turkey breast, 180,000 pounds of dried plums and 114,000 pounds of frozen pork chops.
The Trump administration in late March slashed $500 million that had already been allocated to food aid nationwide through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. That canceled 124 scheduled deliveries to Missouri food banks, according to data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture by ProPublica and shared with The Independent.
Food banks across the state said they have largely made up shortfalls from the March cuts by increasing their food purchases. But some food bank leaders worry that hunger in Missouri will increase with the implementation of changes signed into law this summer to federal assistance programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“Food banks are the safety net to the safety net,” said Leigh Anne Haun, executive director of Feeding Missouri, a coalition of the state’s six regional food banks. “When you talk about programs like SNAP…any time those start to get strained, or there’s holes in those nets, the food banks are the safety net underneath.”
They are also bracing for increased demand as the federal government shutdown wears on. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned Thursday that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if the shutdown continues, and USDA has directed regional SNAP directors to stop working on benefits for November, according to an Oct. 10 letter obtained by Politico.
Meredith Knopp, president and CEO of the St. Louis Area Foodbank, said any disruption the food bank experienced due to canceled deliveries was “minimal,” and that the tornado that hit St. Louis in May and the ongoing shutdown have affected the food bank more.
“Right now it’s just about educating and informing people where they can go for help, how they can get assistance temporarily until the government reopens,” Knopp said of the shutdown.
Knopp said purchases made by the USDA later in the year made up for canceled TEFAP deliveries. On Aug. 1, the USDA announced the purchase of $230 million in fish, dried cranberries, beans and apples for food banks nationwide.

The canceled shipments make up a relatively small portion of what Missouri food banks distribute each year. Missouri’s food banks dispensed 132.2 million pounds of food in 2023, according to the Missouri Hunger Atlas, which is published by the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri.
But Jordan Browning, director of communications for Ozarks Food Harvest in Springfield, said food banks still have to fill in gaps.
The first canceled shipments – over 100 orders of 2% milk headed for 30 states – were scheduled to arrive on May 14, records show. That day, Ozarks Food Harvest and the St. Louis Area Food Bank in Bridgeton were each slated to receive orders of more than 2,000 gallons of milk, according to the records.
At first, Browning said, he thought the deliveries might just be delayed, which had happened in the past.
The next missed delivery date in Missouri was May 31, when all six of the state’s regional food banks were scheduled to receive shipments, according to the records. 
“They kept getting delayed further and further,” Browning said. “Pretty much until it finally came to an actual cancellation notice, we weren’t aware that we would have to make up a shortfall.”
Much of the food was high quality protein, the items that are priciest and hardest for food banks to source, food bank administrators said.
The Southeast Missouri Food Bank received all the orders staff were told to expect, according to Heather Collier, donor relations and communications manager at the Sikeston-based food bank, though some were delayed.
But Collier said shipments can be canceled before the state notifies regional food banks that they should expect a delivery. 
“Canceled loads, if they’re fully canceled, they’re usually happening before we’re even notified,” Collier said.
Collier said that although the food bank weathered the March cuts relatively easily, she expects coming changes to SNAP to increase the number of Missourians who don’t qualify for federal assistance but struggle to reliably access nutritious food.
The budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress in July cuts SNAP by $187 billion through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also expands SNAP work requirements to include adults ages 55-64 and parents of children over 14. 
In the Southeast Missouri Food Bank’s service area, according to Collier, 46.5% of people who are food insecure already do not qualify for SNAP.
“You’re meeting the definition of food insecurity, but not meeting the qualifications to receive assistance,” Collier said. “Food banks are going to have to make that up.”
Haun said community support will enable food banks to continue helping Missourians in need.
“It’s so important for people to connect with their local food bank now,” Haun said. “They need not just funds to allow them to address these gaps, but other types of donations and volunteering.”
Through the shutdown and any future challenges, Knopp was confident the food bank would continue to help.

In March, $500 million was cut in funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that provides food to food banks and other emergency food providers through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, another Department of Agriculture program. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data obtained by ProPublica, this meant that around 94 million pounds of food never reached those food banks. 
For some Michigan groups, especially those that faced greater losses, these cuts have made it more difficult to continue to serve their communities.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Annmarie Zaremba, the Director of Food Sourcing at Forgotten Harvest in Oak Park, said that her organization had lost about $750,000 worth of food in these cancelled deliveries. Much of that was protein like chicken and pork — food items that other donations tend not to include, but that are important for recipients to have in their diets. 
“Our goal is always to give a variety of foods to try to create as much balance distribution as we can,” she said. “For the protein that we do have in inventory, we are being very methodical about it. We have a shipping plan for our protein so that people do get something, it might not be a frozen protein every time, it might be a bean item, and then the next distribution will switch to maybe a frozen chicken item or something like that.”
Not all of the federal support for Forgotten Harvest comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation, and other programs are still providing assistance. 
“We are able to make up some of it,” Zaremba said. “It is getting harder and harder, though, without getting really creative.”
Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit noted that, across all USDA programs, they received 5.1 million pounds less in USDA-donated food in fiscal year 2025 than the year before. 
“Additionally, with 75% of our food going out through our partner network, Gleaners invested our own reserves to purchase over 700,000 pounds of food to help our partner network access food that was not donated,” Kristin Sokul, Senior Director of Advancement at Gleaners, wrote in an email. “While we have been able to meet requests for support as they have been presented to us from partners and community, and we’re still finalizing our fiscal year 2025 numbers, we expect that we will deliver fewer total pounds this fiscal year than we originally projected in our fiscal year 2025 budget.”

Notification of these changes also caught some organizations by surprise. 
“It happened pretty quickly,” Zaremba said. “We had probably a month or so where there was some uncertainty for a while, and then we did get final notification that all of these loads had been canceled and they wouldn’t be replaced.”
Going forward, organizations like Gleaners are having to develop new strategies for allocating food for distribution. 
“To safeguard continued access to nutritious food for our guests for years to come, we have created a Sustainability Plan to invest reserves into innovation and sustainability, increase fundraising efforts, and regularly evaluate expenses for efficiency,” Sokul wrote. “Gleaners remains focused on achieving a hunger-free community in Southeast Michigan with collaborative solutions that empower people and enable them to thrive.”
Michigan Democrats in both houses of Congress sent letters to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in the spring, expressing concerns about these funding cuts and how they would impact emergency food assistance programs. 
U.S. Reps Rashida Tlaib, Haley Stevens, Shri Thanedar, Debbie Dingell and Kristen McDonald Rivet all signed the letter from members of the House of Representatives, while Sen. Elissa Slotkin signed the version coming from the Senate.
But for other groups, the cuts were less pronounced — some fluctuations in deliveries are normal, according to Ed Scott, Director of Macomb Community Action, and occasional cancellations or substitutions are normal. Macomb Community Action had over 4,700 deliveries cancelled, according to the Department of Agriculture data.
“TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program) is a federally managed program that relies on a variety of factors, including supply chain logistics, product availability, vendor capacity, and federal contracting procedures,” Scott added. “As such, it is not uncommon for certain food items to be delayed, substituted, or canceled altogether. These changes are often beyond the control of local agencies and are part of the broader effort to ensure food safety, quality, and responsible stewardship of federal resources.”
A spokesperson for the Mid-Michigan Community Action Agency wrote, “at this time, our food programs are operating normally,” while spokespeople for Samaritas and Kent County Community Action noted that they had not experienced any cuts or cancellations.
The Department of Agriculture declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court against the agency in June over funding cuts to food aid programs.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-20 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,One of most vulnerable states to climate change lacks ‘political will’ to mitigate its disaster threats,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/20/one-of-most-vulnerable-states-to-climate-change-lacks-political-will-to-mitigate-disaster-threats/,"While research suggests Mississippi is as vulnerable to climate change as anywhere in the country, state leadership has failed to embrace mitigation over the last two decades.","FLOWOOD – On the eve of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, members of the Mississippi Building Code Council sat befuddled inside a conference room a stone’s throw from the Jackson airport. 
The council’s leaders agree Mississippi would benefit from a statewide, uniform building code – a policy experts widely believe improves an area’s chances of surviving destructive weather. By lowering risk, strengthening buildings also helps against rising insurance rates. 
“It’s kind of like the three little pigs: You want the straw, the sticks or the brick?” said Jennifer Hall, vice president of the council. “I want the brick.” 
But the Legislature, the council also agreed, has no interest in expanding regulations. If anything, lawmakers are more interested in weakening what rules are in place. 
“There is a movement at the Capitol right now to do away with regulations,” Hall said at the meeting. 
After seeing the impact Katrina had on weaker homes and businesses in 2005, lawmakers in 2014 passed a statewide building code, requiring construction to meet modern standards. But the 2014 law included a key caveat: Within four months of the new regulation going into effect, any city or county could vote to opt out. As it turned out, most did just that. 
Resilience experts, public officials and coastal residents who talked to Mississippi Today pointed to crucial policies to enhance local fortitude against future disasters: funding for mitigation and strong building codes. Yet while research suggests Mississippi is as vulnerable to climate change as anywhere in the country, state leadership has failed to embrace either strategy over the last two decades. 
“Mississippi has had the opportunity to do this for years,” said Julie Shiyou-Woodard, president of Smart Home America and a Pass Christian native. “Sadly, it’s going to show. The choices we made in Mississippi after Katrina, you will see that when we get hit with a direct category 3 (hurricane) again. It will be clear.”

‘A silly question, Senator’
Mike Chaney, a Republican who has been the state’s insurance commissioner since early 2008, estimated that two-thirds of Mississippi’s counties opted out of the 2014 building code standards. Now, just about half of the state has “fairly decent” codes, Chaney said. The lower six counties– including three that touch the Coast – adopted codes shortly after Katrina, although most are now outdated, a federal database shows. The many places in the state without codes altogether are going to “hurt in the long run,” Chaney said.
Hall, who is also executive director of the Mississippi Manufactured Housing Association, said “the only way” lawmakers could have passed the 2014 bill was to allow cities and counties to opt out.
Mississippi Today reached out to several government agencies and organizations, and no one in the state, it appeared, tracked which areas have what building codes. The 2014 law gave no one the authority to actually enforce the codes it put into place, Hall said. In other words, there’s no accountability at the state level, even for the cities and counties that didn’t opt out in 2014.
Last year, the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety ranked Mississippi’s codes near the bottom among coastal states. The impact a lack of codes has on life-safety and property damage “has unfortunately been exposed in recent tornado outbreaks” in the state and “would be exploited in a hurricane impact,” the report said. 
Over the last decade, tornadoes, strong winds and thunderstorms have directly killed 67 people in Mississippi, national storm data show. Also, including hurricanes, those storms have caused over $740 million in property damage in that time.

Disaster and insurance experts also point to mitigation grants as a necessary step toward local resilience. Alabama, Louisiana and other states have launched grant programs to help homeowners in high-risk areas pay for improvements that are often cost-prohibitive otherwise. 
The Mississippi Insurance Department first established its home mitigation program in 2007, but it didn’t receive funding from the state until 2024 when lawmakers set aside $5 million for the department to do a test run. 
With grants up to $10,000, the program paid to upgrade and strap roofs onto homes – protecting against high winds and water leaks – as well as for shutters to guard windows. After slowly rolling out the program, which Chaney said was done to avoid mishaps, the state funded improvements to 28 homes. 
In a dispute that played out in news stories and on social media over the summer, legislators were critical of the department’s ability to run the program. Particularly, Sen. Scott DeLano, a Biloxi Republican, said he disagreed with Chaney’s approach. 
DeLano and other lawmakers slammed the Insurance Department for only doing 28 homes, said Chaney provided scant details about how the program would run, and argued the program should go through an independent contractor. 
As a result, the Legislature omitted funding for the program this past session, and killed a bill that would have paid for the grants through fees from insurance companies. Republican Sen. Walter Michel of Ridgeland presented the bill on Chaney’s behalf.

Some of the criticisms about the pilot fell flat, Mississippi Today found. For instance, DeLano and others pointed to the success story in Alabama – which leads the nation with over 51,000 “FORTIFIED” homes – and said Mississippi should mimic its neighbor to the east. But the Alabama Department of Insurance told Mississippi Today that its program is run almost entirely in-house. 
Chaney’s office pushed back on criticism over the results of its pilot program, arguing it executed more grants than other states in its first year. 
At a Senate committee meeting in January, DeLano criticized Chaney, who was sitting a few feet away, for not also requiring counties to have up-to-date building codes before residents could receive a grant. Doing so would attract more insurance companies into the state, the senator said. 
 After Chaney said he would only support the idea in a separate bill, DeLano fired back: 
“Are you really for mitigation then?” 
“That’s a silly question, Senator,” Chaney responded. 
Responding to Mississippi Today about the exchange, Chaney’s office said requiring a county to have certain building codes would only hold up mitigation progress. 
The two elected officials agreed about the importance of a mitigation program, but each side accused the other of not playing ball. DeLano said Chaney hasn’t provided details of his proposal, and Chaney said DeLano wouldn’t meet with him to discuss the proposal. 
Multiple people told Mississippi Today the distrust between the two sides traces back to 2016, when the state nearly lost $30 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds meant for retrofitting 2,000 homes on the Coast. An Office of Inspector General report recommended FEMA suspend the program after finding the state had spent over $30 million and did work on only 945 homes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency fired the employees it claimed were responsible for the blunder. The agency eventually resumed the program and ended up with $19 million in federal funds, it told Mississippi Today. 
But Rep. Kevin Ford, a Republican from Vicksburg, said lawmakers still have a “bad taste in their mouth.” When asked if the earlier scandal is why the Legislature hasn’t funded the program for roughly a decade, Ford said, “Yes, 100%. There’s no doubt.”
“What it sounds like to me is there is a trust issue,” said Chris Monforton, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, referencing the OIG report. Monforton, who worked with the insurance department to start its pilot program, said the pilot was “very similar” to how Alabama established its mitigation grants. 
When asked about the issues from 2016, DeLano didn’t go so far as to tie it to his disagreement with Chaney, but said “we know the history of mitigation programs in our state.” 
Ford, who wrote a competing mitigation bill in the House this past session, argued that Chaney as an elected official shouldn’t have control over the millions of dollars that would fund the program, suggesting the money could be tilted towards potential voters. 
Chaney strongly disagreed with using an outside company to run the program, arguing a contractor would be more expensive and not subject to the same oversight as the insurance department. Both Ford and Michel said they would reintroduce their bills in the 2026 legislative session, and it’s unclear if either side is willing to compromise.
Rep. Jerry Turner, a Republican from Baldwyn, is the House Insurance Committee chairman and has served at the Capitol since 2004. When asked why it took 17 years for the state to fund a mitigation program, Turner said, “I’m not trying to dodge a bullet or pass a buck, but I think you’d be better served if you talked to the people on the Coast and the insurance (department).”
“I’m not siding either way,” he added. “ I’ll do anything I can to get this thing started off because I think it’s something that the citizens of the state of Mississippi deserve.”
‘The market will collapse’
The parallel rise of disaster risks and insurance costs in the nation’s poorest state begs the question: What will happen if neither trend slows down?
Chip Merlin, an attorney who specializes in insurance claims for homeowners and who worked with Mississippians after Katrina, said eventually communities will have to migrate.
“I think we’re starting to see it already,” Merlin said, pointing to parts of California and Florida that have seen residents leave because of climate risk. “There’s an emotional aspect of once your home gets damaged by flood, wind, wildfire, that I don’t want to be in harm’s way anymore. And people look for a place where it’s less emotionally taxing to live.”

David Baria, a Democratic former state lawmaker from the Coast, said he ran for office in 2007 largely because of the local issues with insurance he witnessed after Katrina. 
Baria called it “a slog” to get any kind of insurance reform passed. He introduced bills in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to fund a mitigation grant program. None made it out of committee. 
“ There were many bills that I attempted to pass to rein in insurance company practices to improve the lot of homeowners, to strengthen structures, and they were routinely opposed by the insurance industry and the leadership of both the Senate and the House,” said Baria, who served in both chambers. 
Both Merlin and Baria criticized Mississippi leadership for not better protecting policyholders, especially around delaying or denying claims after a disaster. 
In 2024, a New York Times analysis of an insurance study looked at which parts of the country pay the most in home policy premiums relative to their house’s value. The analysis found that, throughout Mississippi, that ratio was “much higher” than the national average.  
Smart Home America, a nonprofit based in Mobile, Alabama, has helped strengthen homes and design policy in over 20 states. Shiyou-Woodard, its president and CEO, said she “worked closely” with Chaney’s office to kickstart Mississippi’s mitigation program, and it was on the right track until the Legislature cut its funding.

While policy around mitigation can face obstacles, such as building contractors not wanting to deal with the extra cost of complying with new codes, Mississippi’s lack of local resilience comes down to those in the Capitol, she said. 
“Mississippi is a black hole,” Shiyou-Woodard said, explaining that its neighboring states are ahead of the game. “Why is it not catching up? There should be no reason. It has the same risk as Louisiana, the same risk as Alabama, what’s the problem? The problem in Mississippi has been political will.”
When asked what would happen if the state doesn’t act to lower the risk for homeowners, she pointed to Louisiana, which has only recently seen insurance improvements after a slew of companies pulled out due to frequent disasters. 
“When Mississippi gets hit with a significant wind event, the market will most likely collapse,” she said. “And that’s not fortune telling. That’s just based on the market, and they’re not getting ahead of it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07145917/MT-ClimateSeries-Beach-Banner.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

Campbell settled nearly all the evictions filed between 2010 and 2018 outside of court, or judges had them dismissed. Yet, they still appear when searching her name in the Richland County court system.

“Here I am after years and years and years, and you’re still holding this on me,” Campbell told the SC Daily Gazette.
A bipartisan bill proposed in the House would require the state to remove from public access after 30 days any eviction filings that do not result in an actual court order telling the tenant to get out. Any cases that did result in an eviction order from a judge or were settled in court would be removed from public view after six years under the proposal.
That would wipe Campbell’s record clean.
The 41-year-old mother of four received two court-ordered evictions, also called writs of ejectment, within three months of each other in 2016, according to court records. Another seven are listed as settled, dismissed or disposed.
None of the filings, including the two court orders, resulted in Campbell actually getting kicked out of her home, she said.
Still, the long list of cases that pops up anytime someone searches Campbell’s name in the Richland County court filing system “looks so very ugly,” she said.
South Carolina appeared to have among the highest rates of eviction filings in the country in 2018, with about 23 of every 100 renters having an eviction filed against them, according to the most recent available data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.
Comparisons are hard to draw because different states, and even different counties within states, handle eviction cases in different ways, Stateline has reported.
South Carolina’s data, released after the state NAACP settled a lawsuit over the use of automated technology to collect eviction data, doesn’t include outcomes for those cases.
In 2024, more than 126,000 South Carolina renters had some sort of eviction filed against them in court, meaning they might face difficulty in renting in the future, according to the Legal Services Corporation’s Civil Court Data Initiative.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

As costs continue to rise, paying rent each month is becoming increasingly difficult for many people, said Rev. Carey A. Grady, pastor of Reid Chapel AME Church in Columbia and an advocate for affordable housing.
Landlords may use a filing to put pressure on tenants to pay their rent, even if they have no intention of actually kicking them out of the property, Grady said.
“One filing can haunt you and your family for the rest of your life,” Grady said.
An eviction can be devastating, whether or not the landlord follows through on it, said Mary Ann Fey, pastor at St. John Neumann Catholic Church and a board member for advocacy group MORE Justice, which is short for Midlands Organized Response for Equity and Justice.
A blighted record can mean people have no place to go, continuing a cycle of hardship, she said.
Access to housing has remained a top concern of Richland County residents since the group formed a decade ago and began holding annual community meetings, Fey said.
“Housing is foundational,” Fey said. “When families can not access it, everything else — employment, education, health — becomes harder, and especially harder on children.”
People who have managed to turn their lives around shouldn’t stay beholden to the struggles they faced previously, Fey said.
“This bill does not erase accountability,” Fey said. “Instead, it ensures that the records relied on in making housing decisions are accurate, timely and truly reflective of a person’s current situation.”
Many filings don’t result in actual evictions, and even if they do, they may not reflect a person’s current economic status, said Rep. Carla Schuessler, the bill’s primary sponsor.
Unlike certain criminal charges and bankruptcies, which can be expunged, eviction filings stay with a person forever, often preventing them from finding stable housing in the future, even if they can pay rent, the Myrtle Beach Republican said.

As a former executive director of Horry County’s Habitat for Humanity, Schuessler worked with people who struggled to find housing they could afford because of bad credit histories or eviction records, she said. Removing some of those records could help get more people into homes, she said.
“There’s so much conversation with the housing market and affordable housing and workforce housing and inflation,” Schuessler said. “This is something we can do to help South Carolinians to better their lives.”
Nonpayment isn’t the only reason landlords might file an eviction, which costs $40 and requires little effort on their part, said Sue Berkowitz, director of Appleseed Legal Justice Center, which helped craft the bill.
People who live paycheck to paycheck may consistently pay late because their income doesn’t come in by the first of the month, or a landlord may file an eviction for a different lease violation, such as an extra person staying in the property, Berkowitz said.
She thinks the legislation should be altered to erase eviction records from public scrutiny sooner: three years, instead of six.
A person’s life can drastically change over six years, she said.
“Look back at how your life was six years ago, and it might be very different now,” Berkowitz said.
After several years of financial and personal hardship that led to the eviction filings against her, Campbell is back in stable housing, she said.

She works as a court mediator, helping other people settle disputes, including about evictions, and advocates with MORE Justice. She wants to raise awareness of the eviction process, making sure people know how to look up their own legal histories and what to do if their landlord files an eviction notice.
Arguing against eviction proceedings can be a stressful and time-consuming process that often involves missing work, and judges make default rulings in favor of landlords if tenants don’t show up, Campbell said.
On top of the difficulty in finding housing, an eviction record can take an emotional toll, Campbell said.
She often feels like a failure for the times in her life when she struggled to support her four children, two of whom are in college and two of whom are in elementary school.
She shares a Columbia apartment with her mother, and though the two remain mostly independent, Campbell wishes she could find her own place, she said.
Removing her eviction records could help with that, she said.
“I think just having this bill is a start,” Campbell said. “It’s a start at some change.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4658-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

As we brace with hope, relief and caution for the ceasefire to hold and the Israeli assault on Palestinian people to scale back, there is still a long road to Palestinian rights and wellbeing. The board and management at the Wedge — a 50-year-old food cooperative known for its commitment to food justice, equity, community, and democratic member-ownership — needs to realign with its values, its staff, and hundreds of its members and revoke the policy change they made to censor workers who wore pins in solidarity with Palestinians.  
In March, Wedge management issued a revised dress code prohibiting staff from wearing messages referencing values or causes not explicitly supported by the co-op. This occurred after a small group of Wedge member-owners attended the February board meeting to express disapproval of workers wearing pins that said “Labor for Palestine.”  
As Wedge member-owners and as Jews who oppose the occupation, we believe it is our moral and religious obligation to stand up for human and civil rights and support the workers, at both Lyndale and Linden Hills Wedge locations, who continue to risk their livelihoods by persistently and boldly advocating for their right to free expression and protest the ongoing suffering in Gaza.
Gazans have been starved. According to the UN, just 1.5% of arable land remains accessible or undamaged; the workers’ pins are clearly in alignment with Wedge values, which include food justice. Moreover, we find it unacceptable for any so-called progressive institution — particularly in this moment of extreme national repression — to censure objections to what numerous international and even Israeli organizations have deemed a genocide.  
So, in April, in response to this policy change, over 100 member-owners, many of us Jewish, attended a board meeting to challenge the dress code change and support workers who continued to wear pins in defiance of the dress code. We presented an open letter signed by over 600 people condemning the change. And in May, many of us attended a rally outside the Lyndale location calling on management to adhere to the co-op’s values. 
Instead of publicly answering to co-op owners, CEO Nick Seeberger claimed ongoing contract negotiations with workers was the necessary route to address the issue — despite rejecting proposals and diverting the conversation to a management-worker committee. 
In that context, Seeberger invited workers to draft their own version of a dress code, which staff undertook with tremendous thought and effort. But according to workers, the only concession their effort achieved was the allowance to wear a single pin representing a country’s flag, suggesting that this concession was a stall — not an accommodation made in good faith. 
Meanwhile, in Gaza, 92% of all residences have been destroyed, as well as mosques, hospitals, and schools, from kindergarten to university. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that roughly 240 journalists have been killed. Humanitarian aid was withheld. According to The Guardian, Gaza now leads the world in child amputees. And NPR reports that over 65,000 Gazans have been killed. 
Given this context, the Wedge’s restriction of workers’ speech repudiates our values of justice, equity and commitment to community — precisely the reasons many of us shop there. And, given the number of members who have protested the change, the continued censoring of workers contradicts our value of democratic ownership. 
While the Wedge board of directors may believe it needs to accommodate both sides, the truth is, only one side is morally just. Many Western nations and numerous international, academic, and Jewish organizations have condemned Israel’s actions. To accommodate those who support Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians is to endorse this slaughter. And despite the blessing of this week’s ceasefire agreement, we must be vigilant in truth-telling not only about the past two years of genocide, but about the state of apartheid to which Palestinians have been subjected for decades, and which is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. 
Judaism teaches that no one’s life — not even that of another Jew — is more important than any other life. In light of the atrocities committed against our Palestinian brothers and sisters, it is the duty of all democratic institutions to support those willing to speak out. 
The election for four new Wedge board of trustees runs until October 21st; this would be the time to contact candidates and see where they stand on our stated co-op goal to “meet the goals and aspirations of our community” — specifically as they relate to food justice, free speech. and member-owner participation.  
It is our fervent hope that the Wedge reinstates its former dress code and allows workers their right to free speech in support of those whose world has been destroyed. 
Editor’s note: Wedge Community Co-op responded with a statement: “We are heartbroken over the war in Gaza and have compassion for the Palestinian people. We are hopeful for lasting peace and the end to war and violence. Our mission is building community by developing a strong local food system and are grateful for the role we play in our community.

Huntington Beach and its all-Republican city council have proudly led California’s conservative resistance. Now, if California voters approve Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional maps, the city would be represented by Rep. Robert Garcia, a gay progressive who leads Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.


California may have a reputation as a bastion of blue, but there are only so many Democratic voters to go around.
Under Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to gerrymander California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats, no incumbent Democrat would take on more Republican voters than Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach. 
Garcia’s new district, rather than stretching north from his home town into liberal Los Angeles County, would instead shift southward to encompass a coastal slice of conservative Orange County — notably, the conservative-leaning cities of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
Absorbing those GOP voters into the 42nd congressional district is a point of pride for the 47-year-old Peruvian immigrant, a gay progressive whose sharp-tongued condemnations of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk catapulted him into party leadership as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, the chamber’s main investigative arm. 
He also serves on the committee’s viral “DOGE” subgroup, where he and a group of fellow young progressives use their speaking time to lob sardonic rhetorical questions that cast the proceedings and the chairwoman, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, as absurd and even laughable.
“Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual agenda?” Garcia asked Paula Kerger, president and CEO of the Public Broadcasting Service, during a hearing in March as his staffer held up a life-sized image of the beloved muppet duo.
If his party retakes control of the House next year, Garcia would almost certainly ascend to chair the committee, which has vast subpoena powers, and would become the face of congressional Democrats’ resistance to Trump.
But don’t expect Garcia, a former Long Beach mayor and city councilor, to back down from his anti-MAGA bully pulpit just because he would then represent a town whose city council has embraced the moniker “the MAGA-nificent seven.” 
“Folks have asked, ‘Hey, you know, you’re pretty progressive. Is this gonna impact the way you take on Trump or the oversight committee?’” Garcia told political commentator Katie Phang during a virtual fundraiser for Prop. 50 last month.
“Absolutely not,” he said.
Garcia’s certainty that he’ll win re-election next year, regardless of which maps are used, is precisely the problem with creating noncompetitive districts as Prop. 50 proposes to do, said state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican former mayor of Huntington Beach. 
The city is currently represented by a Democratic congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, who succeeded Democrat Katie Porter when she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate last year. But since the district is currently drawn as a competitive seat, Strickland said, Min must win favor from at least some conservative voters if he wants to stay in office. That wouldn’t be the case for Garcia, should Prop. 50 pass. 
Strickland and other local officials in coastal Orange County are skeptical that Garcia — a former Long Beach mayor who said he’s thrilled that his new district would include the entire city — will prioritize their cities’ needs, especially if he doesn’t need their votes to win. 
“The problem with Prop. 50 is you have predetermined elections. You already know who your congressman is before election day,” Strickland said. “As a pretty conservative city, both Newport and Huntington will have one of the most liberal members of Congress. And I just don’t think that’s healthy.”
“We want to govern ourselves”
While Huntington Beach has long asserted its conservative tilt by resisting compliance with state laws they view as too liberal (such as housing construction requirements), the city in recent years has embraced the national culture wars and grabbed headlines for leading a conservative backlash to the state’s ruling Democrats in Sacramento. 
Residents last March approved a ban on flying the rainbow LGBTQ Pride flag on city property. They greenlit a controversial ordinance requiring voters to bring ID to vote, which Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber argue violates state election laws. (Oral arguments before an appeals court are scheduled for Oct. 22).
And a simmering battle over sexual content in children’s books and Huntington Beach’s public library came to a head in June. 
The city council had previously approved a controversial ordinance establishing a community review board for library books — what critics dubbed a book ban — and also briefly explored privatizing the library, policies they saw as a counterbalance to the state Legislature’s ultraliberal, “woke” laws. But this summer, via special election, voters overwhelmingly supported repealing the review board and limited the city’s ability to outsource library services.
“We really just want home control. We want to govern ourselves,” said Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns. He doesn’t know Garcia personally, but as a former police officer in Long Beach he’s familiar with the former councilmember’s left-leaning politics. 
“Hopefully he’s open to helping us, but if he comes in and tries to break us, you know, break our community and try to crush our council in some way,” Burns said, speaking of Garcia, “well, we’re going to resist. We’re not going to get along.”
Garcia argues that the successful repudiation of the library crackdown is evidence that the city council’s right-wing approach doesn’t fully represent residents’ values. 
“The vast majority of Huntington Beach are good, hard-working, middle-class folks that want a just future for themselves,” Garcia told CalMatters in an interview. “That’s who I’m gonna represent.”
Garcia reiterated that he’s unafraid to speak out, even when he disagrees with decisions made in cities that he represents. Even so, he said he would be proud to represent everyone in his proposed new district and would fight hard to bring federal dollars home to support local projects. He said he would prioritize issues that “everyone cares about,” such as increased affordability, combating climate change and curbing corruption. 
Still, Garcia also repeatedly noted that the proposed district would still be solidly Democratic. He effused confidence that he would handily win re-election next year and, he hopes, help Democrats retake control of the House. 
Democrats have come under fire for drawing the new maps behind closed doors without input from the public or the independent citizens redistricting commission. But Paul Mitchell, the election data guru and redistricting expert who penned the proposed maps, said that in redrawing Garcia’s district to include coastal Orange County, he and his team hewed closely to proposals that advocacy groups previously presented to the independent commission.
Moving Garcia’s district to Orange County was crucial to shore up support for three vulnerable Democrats — Min along with Representatives Derek Tran and Mike Levin — and creating two newly redrawn districts, currently held by Republican representatives Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, that Democrats believe they can flip.
“That was a critical piece of the puzzle,” Mitchell said in an interview. “It facilitates everything in Southern California.”
Fellow California Democrats have sung Garcia’s praises for graciously allowing his district to go from one that Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 32% last November to one in which Democrats only have a 10 percentage point registration advantage.
“Robert Garcia is an incredible team player,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chair of California’s Democratic congressional delegation, in a written statement. “He’s taking in some historically Republican neighborhoods, but it’s still going to be a Democratic district.”
During the same virtual fundraiser in September, Garcia told viewers that taking on more Republican voters was “the right thing to do” because “our democracy’s at stake.” 
“This is not a moment for us to worry about not having competitive seats or about being in Congress for a lifetime,” Garcia said. “This is about winning the majority to protect people and to save our country.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/041025-US-Rep-Robert-Garcia-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten.


California took a big step toward overhauling its reading curriculum last week when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill pushing for phonics-based instruction in elementary and middle school classrooms.
The new law provides training for school principals and reading specialists in the “science of reading,” a method of literacy instruction focused on vocabulary, comprehension and sounding words out rather than learning words by sight. The approach has led to improved reading scores in Mississippi, Louisiana and districts like Los Angeles Unified, which adopted it several years ago.
The law also updates the state’s list of textbooks, flash cards and other classroom reading materials to align with a phonics-based approach.
The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten. Combined, the efforts will dramatically reshape the way children in California learn to read and hopefully lead to higher test scores, experts said.
“California has one of the best literacy policy frameworks in the country right now,” said Marshall Tuck, chief executive of the advocacy group EdVoice and a former candidate for state superintendent of public instruction. “We worked very hard on this and we’re thrilled to get to this point. Now we just have to see it through.”
After years of controversy, little opposition
The new law passed the Legislature unanimously and had little opposition. That’s in stark contrast to previous efforts to bring phonics to classrooms, which met steep resistance from English learner advocates and the state’s largest teachers union. English learner groups said that a phonics-based approach only works for children who are fluent in English; the California Teachers Association said teachers need flexibility to pick a reading program that works for their students.
But those groups threw their support behind the current bill after a few changes: Reading materials will be available in languages other than English, and using phonics-based instruction will be optional, not mandatory. Although the state is pushing all schools to adopt the new approach, some may choose to stay with their existing curriculum, which is permissible under the state’s school governance system that leaves most decisions up to local school boards.
“What does this all mean? It means we’ll see,” said Todd Collins, an organizer of the California Reading Coalition and former Palo Alto Unified school board member. “But I’m hopeful. I think most school districts will get the message that they need to improve early literacy.”
Scores inching up
Collins’ group surveyed 300 California school districts in 2022 and found that 80% were not using a phonics-based approach to reading instruction. That’s changing, with some of the state’s largest districts adopting science-of-reading strategies and seeing good results. Los Angeles Unified, for example, saw its English language arts test scores jump 5.5 percentage points since it adopted a phonics-based curriculum in 2022. San Francisco Unified, Fresno Unified and Long Beach Unified have also seen improvements.
California’s reading scores are about the same as the national average, according to the latest Nation’s Report Card scores, and have been inching up since the pandemic. Last year, 49% of students met or exceeded the state’s English language arts standards — still below pre-pandemic levels but a big increase from the previous year.
Helping teachers
Among those who’ve pushed for the switch to phonics is Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina who co-authored the bill. A former elementary teacher, Rubio hopes the new law will help classroom teachers as much as students and their families.
“It’s hard for teachers to see their kids feel defeated and frustrated,” Rubio said. “Now they’ll be equipped to really help their students succeed.”
She was inspired to author the bill, she said, in part because of her younger brother’s experience in school. He was wrongly placed in special education and never properly learned to read, she said, leading him to disengage from school and drop out in ninth grade. Countless other students have had the same experience, she said.
“I know how much it means to learn to read. It can shape someone’s whole life,” Rubio said. “That’s why we stuck with this.”
Another boost to reading instruction came in June, when Newsom included $200 million in the state budget to train teachers in the science of reading. The money should be enough to train every K-3 teacher in the state, Collins said. Credential programs are already training future teachers in the approach.
Tuck, of EdVoice, said the next step is ensuring the policy rolls out smoothly in schools. The new curriculum is a major shift for most schools, and teachers will need plenty of support.
“We can celebrate today, but tomorrow it’s back to work,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/111722-Whittier-LJ-CM-17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

(Photo by Christian Nunes inaturalist.org CC-by-NC 4.0)The Iowa skipper butterfly, once prevalent in prairies across the middle of the U.S., is now at risk of extinction — according to the Center for Food Safety, which has petitioned federal agencies to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
The Center originally filed a petition on the butterfly in March of 2023, but after several extensions and missed deadlines from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a decision, the Center has filed a notice of intent to sue over the delayed action. 
Center for Food Safety holds that the Iowa skipper, a small bright yellow and orange butterfly, has lost most of its habitat due to agriculture and is further at risk by commercial pesticide spraying, climate change and invasive species. 
Suzannah Smith, legal counsel with the Center for Food Safety, said the Iowa skipper, if listed as endangered, will get designated critical habitat, which she said will be good for a slew of at-risk pollinators. 
“Because they’re an indicator of good prairie habitat, a lot of other pollinators that are just barely hanging on the Great Plains are also really dependent on the habitat that they’re in, and so by designating the habitat for the Iowa skipper, we can also help protect a lot of other pollinators,” Smith said. 
Endangered species designation would also protect the butterfly from actions intended to harm, trap, kill, wound or capture.
Iowa skipper no longer in Iowa
The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit aimed at fighting the industrial food model, called the Iowa skipper a “canary in the coal mine” for high-quality prairie habitat. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North America has lost more than 60% of its grassland biome, and 99% of tallgrass prairie in the continent has been lost because of agriculture, development and invasive species. While the grassland biome used to stretch as far east as Iowa, most of the remaining biome, according to the service, is further west and south. 
The subspecies of skipper butterfly, despite its name, has not been present in Iowa since 2009, according to the center’s petition from March 2023 to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
In addition to Iowa, the butterfly was commonly found in 14 states through the central portion of the country. Now, according to the center’s petition, Atrytone arogos iowa, the Latin name for the butterfly, is typically found only in protected prairie areas in states like Nebraska, Colorado and Oklahoma. 
The center calls the butterfly a “prairie specialist” and holds that the conversion of prairie to cropland, combined with regular application of pesticides on commercial agriculture operations, has contributed to the species’ decline. Smith said even in protected prairie areas, the butterfly is at risk of pesticide drift as the small protected regions are typically surrounded by cropland.
According to the petition, the Iowa skipper faces similar threats to the already endangered Dakota skipper, Poweshiek skipperling and rusty patched bumblebee. 
Legal action 
The Center for Food Safety’s notice of intent to sue alleges USFWS violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to issue a finding on the butterfly within its designated time frame. 
This is the second time the center has issued a notice of intent to sue over the matter. It filed in April 2024 after the initial one year and 90-day deadlines were missed. According to the center, the federal department responded in June 2024 that it would make a 90-day finding, so the center held off on the suit. In October 2024 the USFWS said a listing “may be warranted” for the butterfly, and according to the center, did not issue its 12-month finding on the matter after a full year. The center filed the latest notice of intent to sue on Oct. 8, 2025. 
Smith said it “seemed like” the service was working on reaching a decision in 2024, which is why the center gave it a “bit of a grace period.” But, she said the service then “blew past the deadline,” even before the current government shutdown. 
Staff at USFWS could not be reached for comment on the notice of intent to sue because of the federal shutdown which furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal employees. 
The Center for Food Safety said it intends to sue under the Endangered Species Act if USFWS does not issue its 12-month finding, or “develop a timeline” for the Iowa skipper in the next 60 days. 
Butterfly protections 
The Endangered Species Act, which passed in 1973, is considered one of the strongest laws in the U.S. and has become fairly controversial in the past 50 years. Some believe the law is used by environmental advocates to block various development projects. 
The first notable time the law was used, it protected a small darter fish in a Tennessee river and in the process, stalled a massive dam project. 
Smith said the endangered species designation for the Iowa skipper would protect the butterfly from any “taking” by a private or government actor. Taking, under the act includes things like harming, killing, trapping or wounding. 
Smith said spraying pesticides in an area where the butterflies are known to live would be a form of taking. Controlled burns, which are often used to manage protected areas, can also harm the butterflies, so Smith said endangered species designation for the butterfly could also alter some land management practices in areas the butterfly resides. 
The Center for Food Safety has an extinction crisis campaign as well as campaigns against pesticides, which includes herbicides, insecticides and neonicotinoids. It also fights against things like forever chemicals, genetically engineered foods and confined animal feeding operations. 
“Our belief is that our food system should be nourishing both humans and the planet, and we shouldn’t have a food system that’s destroying our planet,” Smith said. “So we’re trying to make sure that industrial agriculture, including monoculture and pesticides, aren’t pushing pollinators towards extinction.”

The Trump resistance ignited again in the U.S. and California Saturday, underscoring a country that’s on multiple tracks to push back against the president as state lawyers prepare for two marquee court hearings against his administration this week and next.
Nationwide, some protesters held colorful signs, chanted in unison and wore inflatable costumes. It was the second No Kings protest following the first one in June, and it was much bigger this time around, according to organizers: More than 7 million people showed up across 2,700 planned events, compared to June’s rally, which included 5 million people and 2,100 events.
Demonstrators slammed the administration’s crackdown on immigration, deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-leaning states, firing of federal workers and other policies. President Donald Trump’s net approval rating is now -15 percentage points, according to The Economist. Some Californians also showed their support for the state’s redistricting measure, Proposition 50.
Protesters in Los Angeles were nonviolent, reports CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn, who was on the ground in downtown Saturday. But police officers on horseback moved on demonstrators after issuing a number of dispersal orders in the evening to clear the area. Some officers also fired less-lethal munitions. Several people were detained and there was at least one reported arrest, according to ABC 7.
Tens of thousands of protestors rallied together elsewhere in California, including the northern region of the state, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Central Valley and the Inland Empire.
In response to the nationwide protests, Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself wearing a crown, flying a jet labeled “King Trump” and targeting demonstrators with a brown substance.
California’s Attorney General has sued the Trump administration 44 times and two of those lawsuits will see consequential court hearings this week and next. In both cases, California lawyers will seek to persuade judges to undo Trump’s control of the California National Guard. Whether Trump can federalize California troops has been an ongoing legal tussle since June and the issue has expanded to other states.
Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday condemned the Trump administration after a military shell detonated over Interstate 5. The shell went off during a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Newsom had previously opposed the demonstration, arguing that it was “reckless” and closed off a section of the major freeway. No injuries were reported, though shrapnel dropped onto vehicles, reports The New York Times.

Food stamp data: Newsom signed a bill by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks that bans state and local departments from sharing sensitive personal data to increase CalFresh enrollment. The Oakland Democrat’s measure is a rescission of a law Wicks successfully pushed last year. That law allowed state and local public entities — including ones related to education, crime and employment — to override all state privacy laws in order to share data about people who could potentially get food stamps. Wicks said she was reversing course in response to the Trump administration’s attempt to “weaponize state data.” Read more from Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.




Mixed success on reparations bills

Proponents of reparations are regrouping after state lawmakers had mixed success with winning Newsom’s signature for a slate of bills intended to right the lasting damages of slavery and centuries of discrimination against Black Californians, write CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Wendy Fry. 
Of the 16 “Road to Repair” bills the California Legislative Black Caucus prioritized earlier this year, Newsom signed five into law and vetoed five others. One bill Newsom spiked would have allowed colleges to prioritize descendants of enslaved people for admissions. In his veto message, the governor said colleges “already have the authority to determine whether to provide admission preferences like this.”
State Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, said the caucus plans to regroup in a couple of weeks to plan its direction for next year. Two of her reparations bills were signed, including one requiring California State University to research methodologies to determine whether someone is a descendant of an enslaved person.

Weber Pierson, in an interview: “A veto is never, in my opinion, a ‘no.’ It may be a ‘no, for now.’ It may be just a ‘no’ this year. And it may be a ‘no’ but let’s try something different.”

But Chris Lodgson, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, argues the state isn’t moving fast enough, and that passing legislation focused on more reparations research rather than directly repairing harm “is delay by design.”

The Minneapolis school board has formally asked Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams for information that could lead to school closures. They passed a resolution to the effect at a recent meeting. 
The board first drafted the directive —which asks for an initial report to the board by April 2026 — at two day-long meetings in June and August. The planning follows years of discussion about closing schools in a district with 29,000 students but the capacity for 42,000 and thus a bevy of half-empty schools. 
Even as enrollment declines at a school building, the fixed expenses for building staff — like principals, secretaries, nurses, librarians, culinary workers, custodians and social workers — stay the same or go up. With so many buildings below capacity, a big portion of each Minneapolis student’s funding has to go toward covering these fixed building-level costs, draining money away from instruction and extracurricular activities. 
The board resolution comprises topics for district administrators to investigate, including efficient use of current buildings, potential changes to magnet programs, and ways to increase enrollment in the district.
Years-long discussion about the financial burden of operating small enrollment schools 
The process for downsizing the district’s footprint has been long and circuitous. 
In October 2022, the district prepared a comprehensive financial assessment forecasting that without significant cost cutting, the district would end up draining its reserves, while expenses would exceed revenues by the end of fiscal year 2026. The district has avoided that fate by cutting services and raising class sizes, but it is still unable to balance its budget without relying on reserves and other one-time funds.
The 2022 memo did not prescribe closing schools, but it did present an analysis showing enrollment growth alone could not overcome the district’s structural inefficiencies resulting from operating many schools with small enrollments. At the time of the analysis, Anoka-Hennepin was operating 37 school buildings while enrolling about 37,000 students. Minneapolis was operating 61 buildings while enrolling about 29,000 students. Minneapolis had about half as many students per building as Anoka-Hennepin.
The board first publicly discussed reducing the number of schools in March 2023, when then-board Chair Sharon El-Amin asked Rochelle Cox, the then-interim superintendent, to develop a draft plan for “school transformation.” Neither Cox nor the board took action.
Two months before current Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams started at the district in early 2024, the School Board passed a “transformation resolution” that directed the district to do an accounting of physical space but stopped short of calling for a timeline on school closures. 
Sayle-Adams promised to tackle “right-sizing” the district after passing a budget in June 2024, because, she said, the community asked her to address the issue. 
Low enrollment schools require more funding per student for building-level staff
The district is contending with rising costs and operating a significant number of small buildings, as well as buildings operating below capacity. Given the rising fixed costs of operating these buildings, that leaves less money for everything else, from class size reduction to teacher pay and programs commonly found in most school districts like world languages, art, music and athletics.
Across the district, as building-level enrollment has declined, students have lost access to services like academic support if they’re struggling; staff to address student behavior; and community liaisons to help parents connect with schools. Small elementary schools have difficulty funding full-time positions for electives like art, music and gym, while hiring part-time staff for these positions is challenging. Some elementary students have gone without these electives, or only have music or art for part of the school year.
Enrollment declines at middle and high schools have meant fewer elective options, like world languages, dance, theater and orchestra, as well as extracurriculars. Students also lose access to advanced coursework — like AP or IB classes — when there are too few students in the school who want to enroll. Many of the district’s high schools are now sharing athletic teams because individual schools lack enough students and funding to support a robust athletics program.
The decline in services drives some families to schools outside the district that have the services and programs they desire, compounding the enrollment declines.
Declines in enrollment mitigated by new-to-country students
Minneapolis Public Schools lost about 15% of its enrollment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a combination of factors including implementing a controversial plan redrawing school boundaries, and keeping its schools closed longer during the pandemic than any other Minnesota district, which was followed in March 2022 by a three week educator strike. 
The district has enjoyed a small enrollment increase both last year and this year. Although the district does not track the immigration status of students, the increase has been attributed almost entirely to students newly arrived to the United States from Central America. Since the 2021-22 school year, English learner students have increased from 17% of the district’s students to 23% in the 2024-25 school year, according to Minnesota Department of Education data. 
This year, the district expects to spend at least $17 million more on English learner services than it receives in funding from state and federal sources. Although the Legislature increased state aid for English learners during the 2023 legislative session, the district’s funding is insufficient to cover the cost of providing the intensive services needed by students with the lowest levels of English proficiency. 
Many of the newcomer students are also unhoused, which has led to growing costs for the district to transport students from shelters outside district boundaries, as required under the federal McKinney-Vento law. The state has started to pay the cost of this transportation under a law passed in 2023.
It is not clear whether changes to federal immigration policy will impact the district’s ability to continue to rely on newcomers to stabilize or grow enrollment in the future.
Future enrollment expected to decline, limiting district’s funding
Hazel Reinhardt, a demographer hired by the district, says enrollment is likely to continue to decline in the coming years because of lower birth rates, fewer families choosing to raise children in the city, and the state’s favorable laws around charter schools and open enrollment, allowing parents to send their children to St. Paul or suburban schools. 
Reinhardt told the board in June that once parents leave for charter and private schools or open enrollment options, “precious few” districts are able to bring them back. 
Most of the district’s funding is based on enrollment, so declining enrollment has created a ballooning fiscal crisis. Growing costs for both labor and services have outpaced increases in state and local funding. 
The district continues to cut services, increase class sizes and pull from its dwindling reserve funds to balance its annual budget. The district is expected to use $25 million from its reserves this school year after using $85 million from reserves last school year.
The district’s enrollment woes and related financial distress are not unique to Minneapolis, with similar challenges facing large urban districts like Oakland, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and Portland. Denver and Oakland have closed a small number of schools in recent years, but not enough to stabilize district finances. And school boards in Seattle and San Francisco have walked away from closure plans after significant public pressure, leaving both districts with growing budget deficits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692
,California,2025-10-20 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Stockton is redefining its identity through the evolution of its hip-hop scene,Tama Brisbane,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/stockton-identity-evolution-hip-hop-scene/,"Stockton struggles with an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities.","Guest Commentary written by

Tama Brisbane
Tama L. Brisbane is Stockton’s Poet Laureate Emerita and a literary and performing arts consultant.


I watched a new era in Stockton’s hip-hop scene come of age.
Moving to the Central Valley city in the early 2000s, I found a hip-hop community that was its own form of resistance. Smoldering frustration with poverty, racial tension and a reputation for violence that it couldn’t seem to shake. Stockton’s sound was silenced more often than it was supported.
My adopted home carries a peculiar duality: burdened by perception and powered by persistence. Hip-hop here didn’t arrive gently. Hell, it wasn’t even invited — it bum-rushed its way in. 
One of the longest odds Stockton hip-hop struggles with is an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities. We’re 45 minutes from Sacramento and nearly two hours from the Bay, in the middle of a region nobody knows how to define. The Bay has hyphy and an iconic ambassador in E-40. 
But Stockton? This in-between place never had a defining sound all its own. 
But distant didn’t mean dismissed. Even as far back as the 1980s, Stockton was in the building. Thanks to legendary and local promoters like Hardin Fulcher, Brian Sampson, Thaddeus Smith and others, acts like Too Short, The Fat Boys, even N.W.A pulled up. And the Civic Auditorium was the stage of the people, home to hip-hop before the city ever thought to make it actually welcome.
Contrast that with the venerable Bob Hope Theatre, the city’s downtown showpiece before the construction of Stockton Arena. In an earlier era, Black residents were relegated to sitting in the balcony, demonstrating how cultural exclusion was built into the city’s entertainment DNA. 
Then in 2006, Stockton opened a $68 million arena, its official entry into the lucrative concert industry. The city had a chance to debut the venue with Carlos Santana — globally famous, riding the wave of mega-hit “Smooth,” and culturally resonant with Stockton’s large Hispanic community. Instead, white, aging, tepidly popular Neil Diamond was chosen, and paid $1 million— up front. The city trumpeted a sellout show, but behind the scenes they gave away huge blocks of tickets to fill embarrassingly empty seats. 
The final tally: $400,000 in losses and a public outcry that cost the city manager his job. 
At the same time, the city’s code enforcement campaign was targeting local promoters, nickel and diming them with excessive event permit, security and insurance fees — $100 if there was dancing, more for amplified sound, and a requirement to hire off-duty police officers as security. 
How you gon’ hip-hop in stillness and silence? The fees weren’t just applied unevenly — they were weaponized, wielded against a genre and a culture. 
In 2005, when I was appointed to Stockton’s Civil Grand Jury, one of our investigations spotlighted the city’s discriminatory entertainment policies and burdensome fees. When our report was published in 2006, the city was put on notice — and on the clock — to make changes. The official door for hip-hop in Stockton was opening.
Enter Common: rapper, poet, activist. Thanks to the University of the Pacific’s Music Management Program, in 2007 he became the first hip-hop act to perform at the Hope. The sold-out show represented a seismic shift in the city’s entertainment landscape. And for weeks, one question echoed throughout the local hip-hop scene: Who’s opening for Common?
I pitched a local, collaborative showcase to the university. A Stockton-centric opening set, that reflected the range, artistry and elevation possible — and profitable — for the hip-hop scene.
Hip-hop in Stockton didn’t just survive — it’s evolved. Local artists who once struggled to book a venue now shape the entire city’s entertainment vision. In the person of Adonis Spiller, aka MadSpill, hip-hop now sits on the Stockton Arts Commission, influencing both artistic funding and policy. 
And the arena that once hosted Neil Diamond’s costly debut/debacle? It’s since welcomed E-40, Lil Wayne and a parade of revenue-generating hip-hop acts. Stockton hasn’t produced a breakout star — yet — but the infrastructure, energy and community remain undeniable.
In the end, Stockton hip-hop isn’t just about music, or even money. It’s about creating and showcasing 209 stories. Stockton’s hip-hop scene was built, not in spite of this city’s notorious violence, but oftentimes in direct response to it. 209 contends with crime, systemic disinvestment, apathy and oppression towards its youth and communities of color — conditions that color the lyrics and experiences of its artists.
Artists like Daddex, MBNel, EBK Jaaybo, Mundo, Jelani, Deozene, Surf Baby, Braxy, Zeps, BLoveJones, Haiti Babii, Steve Spiffler and Mikeila Janae are making waves regionally and beyond. It’s Jazmarie LaTour, Stockton Poet Laureate, host of the city’s longest-running open mic, and Hatch Workshops, where hip-hop happens. It’s The Lyte, or word-of-mouth but now standing room only event where performance artists come to shine. 
And one day, it’s gonna be about that time when it was, finally, Stockton hip-hop’s time.

An audit last week said the now-defunct Maryland Racetrack Operating Authority Board failed to document agreements for a $10 million loan for the track as well as millions in consulting contracts. (File photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A now-extinct state board charged with overseeing the redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course and overseeing thoroughbred racing in the state failed to formalize an agreement for $10 million in working capital and ensure that millions in consulting contracts were in the state’s best interest and competitively bid.
The findings are part of a report on the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority released Thursday by the Office of Legislative Audits.
The report found “significant deficiencies” in the operation of the board that auditors said could “adversely affect MTROA’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate effectively, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.”
Auditors said they also found “significant instances of noncompliance” with state laws and regulations.
The authority was created in 2023 as part of what is seen by many as a last-ditch effort to preserve the state’s horse racing and related industries, revitalize Pimlico and prevent the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown, from leaving Baltimore and perhaps Maryland.
The 13-member authority was tasked then with creating a “best in class” racing venue. The authority was to take over the track and consolidate thoroughbred racing in the state. The authority created the nonprofit Maryland Jockey Club last year to manage day-to-day racing operations as the state took over the track as well as the licensing of the Preakness and related races and memorabilia.
Audit finds lax credit card oversight at Department of Assessments and Taxation

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Annapolis hinted at trouble with the arrangement. Hearings early in the session yielded little additional information.
But in March, as the session was winding down, a budget conference committee added surprise language dissolving the authority and bifurcating racing and redevelopment efforts.
The Maryland Stadium Authority was tasked with overseeing the demolition and construction of a new Pimlico track as well as a modern training facility. The Maryland Economic Development Corp. assumed responsibility for racing operations and community redevelopment.
The redevelopment of Pimlico is now underway under the changes made earlier this year.
The legislative audit sheds light on concerns about the authority handing millions in state money to the jockey club and used to hire consultants.
In one instance, auditors found the authority failed to secure a written agreement with The Maryland Jockey Club governing what auditors described as a $10 million “working capital advance” or loan. A typical agreement should have detailed the roles and responsibilities of the authority and jockey club in managing and operating Pimlico and the training facilities.
“Such agreements are critical for establishing oversight over the $527 million that the General Assembly has committed to the redevelopment of Pimlico and training facilities,” auditors wrote.
The governor’s office, responding for the now-defunct thoroughbred racetrack authority, agreed with many of the findings. But it challenged the idea of $10 million in working capital as “a loan.”
Deputy Chief of Staff Manny Welsh, in a written response, said the 2023 law “does not specify that the working capital authorized in the law be treated” as a loan.
He added that the authority board “did not conduct a vote on any agreements to clarify that the working capital was to be treated as a loan advance or finalize any terms for repayment.”
Auditors, in a note at the end of the report, said they stood by their description.
In the report, auditors wrote that a draft agreement written in February 2025 “referred to the $10 million as an operating loan and as such, this description was included in our analysis. The terminology is also consistent with the description … provided to us by MTROA management during our audit.”
A second finding — which the governor’s office agreed with and deemed accurate — involved five consulting contracts totaling $1.9 million.
Auditors reported that the authority “did not ensure the contracts included clearly defined deliverables and deadlines and that the related invoices were detailed. Therefore, there was a lack of assurance that invoices were appropriate to pay and that the services were provided timely.”

The Crew monitors 12 species spanning over 140 plots each year. (Courtesy Institute of Applied Ecology)Last month, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced it had partnered with the Department of the Interior to cut $14 million worth of environmental grants, including $2.5 million for New Mexico.
The Institute of Applied Ecology, based in both Oregon and here in New Mexico, is one of the organizations that had a large swath of its funding cut.
“We work with native plant materials development,” said Katy Silbert, the assistant branch director of the institute’s southwestern branch. “Which means that we are collecting seeds from the wild to then grow those plants and put them back on the landscape.”
In addition to replanting, the institute does experimental research and monitoring of rare plants in partnership with private landowners, and a slew of federal, state, and local agencies across seven states.
Silbert said that the funding cuts seemingly came out of nowhere, with some of their staff learning about them while out in the field.
“One of our ecologists was doing a planting with our Bureau of Land Management partners and were finding out [about the cuts] at the same time that we were,” Silbert told KUNM.
The cuts were spearheaded by DOGE, and the Trump administration claimed on the social media site X (formerly known as Twitter) that these grants, which make up over half of Silbert’s budget, were “wasteful” because their DEI-esque hiring initiatives weren’t aligned with agency “priorities.”
The now-cancelled awards came from a slew of agencies under the Department of the Interior – from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Land Management for initiatives for delivering on the ground conservation or building conservation capacity.
“Real action = real savings,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum wrote on social media. DOI is also currently preparing to implement another round of agency-wide layoffs.
Overall, the Institute for Applied Ecology received 30 federal award cancellation notices on Sept. 23 from Department of the Interior agencies totaling somewhere around $3.5 million. Silber said $2.5 million of that was specifically for conservation in New Mexico.

Other organizations that lost funding include the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and the Lomakatsi Restoration Project. It’s common for these types of awards and grants to be reimbursed after organizations have spent their own personal funds for a project, which is then paid back by the federal government after a review process. These agreements can span several years.
This means that Silber’s team has already spent money that they might not get back.
“It can be a challenge to balance that when we have some of these larger expenditures – because conservation, while very important, isn’t always cheap, but it’s always worth it,” Silber said.
Silber pointed out that their habitat restoration efforts are broadly beneficial for many New Mexico species – including the lesser prairie-chicken, chestnut-collared and thick-billed longspurs, and the monarch butterfly.
“There are these massive ripple effects of having fewer resources on the landscape,” she added.
While some of these projects will still go forward and others reevaluated, the slashes are having an immediate effect, forcing the institute to lay off two seasonal youth field crews and four other regular positions.
These cuts come in the midst of a systemic push to overhaul agencies under the executive branch, where President Donald Trump is broadly attacking popular conservation policies and public lands in the name of energy exploration and economic development.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/appliedecology-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As geothermal developments bloom in Utah, lawmakers aim to answer: who has claim on the geothermal resources in the state? 
“We have a lot of geothermal resources, and they’re not being developed as much as they should or could be,” Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday. “And the question was, who owns the geothermal resource in the state of Utah? Is it a water right? Is it a surface right, or is it a mineral right?” 
Currently, the Utah Division of Water Rights reviews permits for geothermal developments, a process that can be done in about 30 days, Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday.
While industry players are happy with the fast permitting timelines, there’s still uncertainty about who holds what right, McKell said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The process, under a new bill from McKell, will be a little bit of a hybrid. Land owners will be able to own the energy-producing heat below their land, regardless of whether someone else owns rights to minerals like oil or gas in the space.
However, energy producers must also have a water right for the geothermal fluids they have to use since traditionally, the technology uses water or working fluids to carry heat to turn turbines.
The Division of Water Rights would still approve applications to operate wells for geothermal production under McKell’s bill.
The bill would also affect the water rights division’s public record practices. If approved, it would delete part of the code that says that geothermal filings to the division are public records “unless the owner or operator requests, in writing, that the records be held confidential” for a maximum of five years.
“Previously, the state engineer would hold the proprietary data for five years. It’s reducing that to one year, which we think is a good thing to encourage geothermal development,” state engineer Teresa Wilhelmsen told the legislative panel.
The proposal passed as a committee bill, but still faced skepticism from some members. The bill will go through a full legislative approval process with considerations in Senate and House committees, a path that McKell specifically requested.
“This is a big enough issue, and I think it’s actually helpful for us to signal this to industry that we’re working on it and we’re providing this clarity,” McKell said.
Other Western states are mixed on geothermal rights, McKell said. Wyoming, for example, includes geothermal fluid in its definition of underground water, so energy producers need to apply for a water permit to access the geothermal heat. Others, like Nevada, Oregon and Washington tie geothermal rights to the owners of the land on the surface. 
Unique, waterless geothermal system moving forward in Utah

Utah has essentially been operating under the model laid out in the bill, but it’s now being codified, McKell said.
Jim Goddard, geothermal program manager at the Utah Division of Water Rights, said in a presentation that this bill would tackle one application of geothermal generation — electricity, which is accomplished at high temperatures.
Other geothermal uses, like direct heating and cooling done at lower temperatures, will be regulated differently. 
The Point development, located at the site of the former Utah State Prison, for example, has the potential to develop an existing geothermal well to provide community heating and energy, greenhouse support and recreation. Because the system used at The Point isn’t hot enough to produce electricity, it wouldn’t fit in this specific legislation.
One of McKell’s goals with the bill is to make the regulatory burden as low and economical as possible, he said. Another is to encourage private geothermal development in the state.
During the meeting Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, expressed concern about whether the geothermal operation would affect local water rights used for irrigation and other purposes.
“That is exactly why we have to keep a water right attached, so that we can go through that process and identify if existing rights will be impaired or affected by that, and then we can take appropriate action,” Wilhelmsen said.

The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties.

When do polls open?

Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 

Where do I find my polling place

The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.

What do I need to vote?

Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card
State-issued ID (Alabama or any other state)
Federal-issued ID

Where is the district located?

The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties, including Valley, Lanett and Smiths Station.

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after Wood resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 38 is solidly Republican. Wood won in 2022 with almost 90% of votes against Libertarian Charles Temm Jr. She won with about 70% of votes in 2018 against Democrat Brian McGee.

What issues dominate the race?

Messer and Nelson have both said they want income tax reform, but the current rates are locked via a 1933 constitutional amendment. Any changes would have to be done through a different constitutional amendment. 
Messer also wants an election audit law, which Wood tried to do while she was in the Legislature. Nelson wants every school, public and private, to have a school resource officer.
Multiple attempts to reach Dixon have been unsuccessful. 

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $55,000 and spent almost $41,000. About one-third of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began.
Messer has raised about $16,000 and spent almost $22,000. He had almost $9,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. According to campaign finance records, the EAGL PAC donated $1,000, the sole PAC donation to Messer’s campaign.
Nelson has raised over $22,000 and spent almost $21,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. All of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.

What happens after Tuesday?

The Republican with the most votes will face Democratic candidate Hazel Floyd, 21, on Feb. 3, 2026. If a candidate does not receive 50% of the vote, a runoff primary election will be held on Nov. 18.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

They’re also holding on to their properties longer before putting them up for sale, in keeping with a nationwide trend.
Las Vegas home sellers saw a median profit of 53% in the third quarter of this year, down from 59.6% a year ago. The typical Las Vegas home sold in the third quarter had been owned for about eight and a half years, according to a new report from ATTOM, a real estate data analyst. 
Seller gains in Southern Nevada topped out in the second quarter of 2022 at 81.8%, based on transactions going back to 2008.  Profit margins are based on the difference between the purchase and resale price.  
The median sale price of a home sold in Reno in the third quarter was $548,000, down from $555,000 in the second quarter, and down from $577,570 a year ago. 
Profit margins in Reno peaked in the second quarter of 2022 at 88.5%. 
Reno homeowners who sold in the third quarter earned a median profit of 54.8%, down from 68.1% a year ago. The typical homeowner in Reno owned their property for approximately nine and half years. 
Homeowners in the U.S. made a median profit of 49.9% on homes and condos sold during the third quarter. That’s down from 55.4% a year ago, according to the report. 
The median sale price of a home in the U.S. in the third quarter was $370,000, up 1.2% from the second quarter and up 3.4% from last year. 
The median sale price in Las Vegas, according to ATTOM, was $445,000, down from $449,000 last quarter, but up from $440,000 a year ago. 
U.S. homeowners are keeping their properties longer before putting them up for sale. 
“Owners had held homes sold in the third quarter of 2025 for an average of 8.39 years before selling them, the longest average homeownership tenure in at least 25 years and up from 8.13 years for homes sold in the previous quarter,” the report says. 
Among metropolitan areas with populations above 1 million, the largest average profit margins last quarter were in San Jose, CA (94.3%); Seattle, WA (80.2%); Buffalo, NY (80%); Rochester, NY (77.3%); and Hartford, CT (75%).
The lowest average profit margins among the biggest metro areas were New Orleans, LA (19.6%); San Antonio, TX (22.8%); Houston, TX (30%); Austin, TX (31.8%); and Dallas, TX (33.5%).
 Profit margins are still above pre-pandemic levels, according to ATTOM’s data.  
“Prior to 2020, home sellers saw profit margins of around 30 percent. As the Covid-19 pandemic induced people in search of more space to leave cities and buy homes, profits doubled to more than 60 percent in mid-2022,” the report says. “The average seller’s return has been dropping steadily since that peak, but over the last three quarters it’s held just below 50 percent.”
Big cities. Bigger prize. 
In terms of cash, the typical home sale generated a profit of $123,100, the report says, but notes “large disparities, with sales in the top major urban areas generating 18 times more in profit than those at the other end of the spectrum.”
The west coast swept the category of top large metropolitan areas with the largest raw dollar profits, with San Jose, CA leading the way with $740,500, followed by San Francisco, CA ($450,000); San Diego, CA ($350,000); Los Angeles, CA ($349,500); and Seattle, WA ($325,000).
According to a 2024 Consumer Affairs report, some 158,000 Californians have moved to Nevada since 2020, making up 43% of new residents within the past four years.
Major metros with the smallest raw profits were New Orleans, LA at $41,000, followed by San Antonio, TX ($55,895); Oklahoma City, OK ($63,000); Birmingham, AL ($68,500); and Louisville, KY ($71,000).
While real estate gains “remain below the peak levels reached during the pandemic, recent quarters suggest a more stable, sustainable market environment,” the report said of the national outlook. “Continued buyer demand, bolstered by moderating mortgage rates, may be helping to maintain solid returns for sellers across much of the country.”
Institutional investors not going away  
Purchases by institutional investors such as hedge funds made up 6.4% of sales nationwide in the third quarter, down from 7% in the second quarter, but up from 6.1% a year ago. Homes sold to institutional investors accounted for 6.4 percent of all sales nationwide, down from 7 percent in the previous quarter but a slight increase over 6.1 percent in the third quarter of last year.
Texas had the highest proportion of sales to institutional investors at 8.8%, followed by Missouri (8.8 %); Tennessee (8.7%); Indiana (8.4%); and Mississippi (8.4%).
Additionally, Las Vegas was among the five metro areas with the lowest percentage of lender sales. Seattle, WA had the lowest share (0.5% of all sales), followed by Los Angeles, CA (0.6%); Charlotte, NC (0.6%t); Las Vegas (0.6%); and Phoenix, AZ (0.6%).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-468653152-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

A Homewood charter school that was founded to serve LGBTQ+ students got renewed last week, but school officials said they had taken out language about their mission. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)I’m not a fan of charter schools. Broadly speaking, they do little to improve learning outcomes and siphon resources from traditional public schools.
We don’t need that in a state that underfunds education, particularly where Black Alabamians are concerned.
But I hate bullies. And I hate what the bullies running our state have done to Magic City Acceptance Academy.
The charter school opened in Homewood in 2021, focusing on LGBTQ+ students. It was the first of its kind in Alabama, but not the first in the nation. New York’s Harvey Milk High School dates back to 1985. Pride School operated from 2016 to 2018 in Atlanta.
Whatever you think of charter schools, LGBTQ+ students are often the targets of cruel people. Three-fourths of LGBTQ+ students responding to a 2022 survey said they had experienced harassment; a third of them said it had been physical. Other surveys have found that physical bullying of LGBTQ+ students is even worse in the South. Which can lead to horrible outcomes, including increased risk of suicide.
Needless to say, all public schools should enforce anti-bullying policies and make students feel safe and welcome. But there is a clear logic to opening a school where students don’t have to worry that their sexual identity will put them in danger.
Magic City did not limit its enrollment to gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender students. But it aimed to make LGBTQ+ students feel welcome. Students in the school told al.com in 2022 that they could thrive at Magic City. They could even attend the prom, something they didn’t feel safe doing before.
Unfortunately, Magic City couldn’t stop the ambitious bullies in our political class.
In 2022, Republican Tim James tried to boost his floundering gubernatorial campaign by attacking a drag performance presented by the school’s teachers. Even by the gutter standards of Alabama politics, it was despicable. It led to harassment of school students and officials and forced the charter to invest in security.
Two years later, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 129, a law banning publicly-funded DEI programs and “divisive concepts,” which can be roughly defined as anything suggesting a world beyond the views of wealthy white heterosexuals.
That’s about as clear as I can get. The law is vague in its definitions. Which is convenient for those who get into politics to hurt people.
And in Magic City’s case, it seems to have worked.
The school did get its charter renewed last week. In some ways, that was a victory over Alabama’s far-right media, which treats vulnerable people as things to be threatened.
But a lot seems to have been lost. Magic City Acceptance Academy is no longer a school that aims to help LGBTQ+ students. That language is gone, according to the testimony of Patton Furman, the principal and superintendent of the school.
“We have taken that out,” he told the Alabama Public Charter School Commission. “We are affirming to all people.”
That’s fine, but the point of the academy was giving LGBTQ+ students a place to live as themselves. If a school is simply “affirming” everyone’s existence, what makes it so different from a public school?
There are smaller losses, too. The school altered its logo. It had to recontextualize the rainbow motifs in its building.
They’re even teaching kids at the school to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America,” President Donald Trump’s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. That’s sad. I’m sure that petty burst of insecurity has already been replaced two or three times over in Trump’s head with something else from his bottomless persecution complex.
I sympathize with Furman, who is playing a bad hand as best as he can. A school that welcomes everyone is nothing to criticize.
But it’s a terrible marker of the nation’s degeneracy. Ten years ago, bigotry around sexual identity seemed to be dying. We could see a future where gender and orientation mattered as much as eye and hair color. We could imagine a nation free of the poison of closeted behavior and the trauma of forcing people to deny who they are.
Today, Alabama makes it a crime to provide health care to transgender people. Lawmakers work every year to force LGBTQ+ communities out of public life.
This is the environment the school faces. We live in a time where a small band of zealots want to beat Alabama into an either/or way of life, where conformity is all and individuality is a threat.
So there are two ways to view the changes they’ve made.
One is that Magic City has abandoned their outreach to LGBTQ+ youth.
The other is that they’re concealing that mission, hoping to survive until the storm ends.
In the latter case, it may be the only way for the school to keep going.
But it’s a baleful moment. A place meant to allow LGBTQ+ youth to be their best selves now models ways to hide what it is.
That’s an outrage. Places like Magic City should be lifting us to a better future. Instead, they’re knuckling under, showing what governance by bigotry and grievance has cost us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PXL_20230516_163756103-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

The cyber attack ended up crippling several critical services like the Department of Motor Vehicles for over a week, and the full extent of the data that was compromised is still unknown as state officials, the Cyber Security Infrastructure Administration, and the FBI continue their investigation. 
However, one critical state service – the Secretary of State’s voter registration information – remained untouched. This was due in large part to a 2021 law that mandated centralizing voter data into a top-down voter registration system, consolidating all counties’ voter information. 
The old system, which had required each county to individually track and record voter data, was a bottom-up system where counties had to manage their own lists and cybersecurity before the information was transmitted to the SOS system. In contrast, the Voter Registration and Election Management System (VREMS) requires that all counties report voter registration and election data into a single system, which allows for more uniform list maintenance and provides a more secure cybersecurity infrastructure, as seen with the cyber attack earlier this year. The change, although expensive, has resulted in a safer and more transparent system for election officials and voters alike. 
The implementation of VREMS removed siloes between the Secretary of State and county clerks, allowing not just for easier list maintenance, but also strengthening the state’s ability to safeguard the information in one system rather than the patchwork the state had previously. 
All in all, the adoption of the new VREMS systems has demonstrated its value in more ways than one, and Nevada voters can rest assured knowing that their voter registration data was not compromised in the latest cyber attack. However, the attack is also a signal of what’s to come and a reminder that we cannot let our guard down. 
Specific voter data – such as addresses, partial security numbers, and driver’s license numbers – is sensitive and should remain guarded from malicious or third-party actors. Yet, budget cuts at the federal level to organizations like CISA, combined with a rise in cyber attacks like the one we experienced earlier in the year, add layers of complexity to that mandate for state officials. 
While we wait to learn more about the full extent of Nevada’s cyber attack, we’re taking this time to learn what went right in Nevada’s switch to the VREMS system and protect against future attacks by continuing to learn and adapt to emerging cybersecurity threats. For so many Nevadans, participating in elections is a dearly held right. We must do everything we can to make sure that this right, and the information we give to exercise it, remains safe.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

Here's what to know.","Next month, Connecticut voters will head to the polls to elect candidates for local positions in their city or town.
No statewide or national elections — like those for United States Senate and House of Representatives seats or for governor of Connecticut — are held in odd-numbered years. But on Nov. 4, many communities throughout the state will still elect officeholders to positions like mayor, city councilor, alder or board of education member.
Here’s what to know about the upcoming elections.
How do I know who’s running in my city or town?
The Secretary of the State’s office publishes sample ballots online for each city and town, which show the candidates running. You can find yours here.
Many Connecticut municipalities publish the sample ballots on their websites as well. 
Where and when can I vote?
Polls will be open from Oct. 20 through Nov. 2 for early in-person voting. Early voting is a relatively new option for Connecticut voters — the state implemented it for the first time last year after the legislature approved it in 2023.
Early voting will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, including weekends. On Oct. 28 and 30, the polls will have extended hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Each municipality is required to have at least one polling location — typically at a town or city hall — and those with populations of 20,000 or more have the option to open multiple locations. 
Your early voting polling location may be different from your Election Day polling place. Find your early voting location on the Secretary of the State’s website here.
On Election Day, polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can find your polling place here.
Can I vote absentee?
Possibly, if you meet certain requirements.
In Connecticut, you are only allowed to vote by mail for one of the following reasons: you’re an active member of the U.S. military; you will be out of town on Election Day; you will be serving as an election official at a different polling location; you can’t vote for religious reasons that day; or sickness or a physical disability will prevent you from making it to the polls on Election Day.
Absentee ballots for the Nov. 4 election became available on Oct. 3. To get one, you must first apply for it by sending a completed absentee ballot application to your town clerk’s office. You can download the application here or pick one up at your town clerk’s office.
A ballot will then be mailed to you, and after filling it out, you or a “designee” can return it by mail, drop it in a ballot drop box or return it in person to the town clerk. Full absentee ballot guidelines, including who qualifies as a designee, can be found here.
Last fall, Connecticut voters approved a constitutional amendment that allowed for universal (also known as “no-excuse”) absentee voting, paving the way for the legislature to pass a law allowing every voter to cast an absentee ballot. However, the legislature has not passed such a law, so absentee ballots are still only available to voters who meet the qualifying circumstances.
What if I’m not registered to vote?
Connecticut offers same-day voter registration during the early voting period and on Election Day. 
During early voting, you can register at your polling place. On Election Day, you can register at your town’s Election Day registration site, which can likely be found on your municipality’s website.
What are some of the biggest races?
The two largest cities with mayoral elections in November are New Haven and Stamford. In both cities, incumbent Democratic mayors are running for reelection against Republican challengers.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker is running for a fourth two-year term. His Republican opponent is Steve Orosco, a former MMA fighter and the founder of SMASH MMA, a mixed-martial arts events organization.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons is running for a second four-year term. Her Republican opponent is Nicola Tarzia, founder of a plumbing, heating and construction services company and former Stamford Board of Education member.
Norwalk and Hamden also have mayoral elections, but in those municipalities, candidates are running for open seats. 
In Norwalk, the Democratic nominee is Common Council President Barbara Smyth, a retired teacher who defeated fellow council member Darlene Young in the primary. She’ll face off against Republican nominee Vinny Scicchitano, an auto repair shop owner and member of the Saint Ann’s Club of Norwalk.
Hamden’s Democratic nominee is former school board chair and longtime town official Adam Sendroff, who won a five-way primary race. His Republican opponent is Jonathan Katz, a paralegal who holds degrees in economics and international political economy from Fordham University.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1105_SR_Polling_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Vermont’s lack of an “authority having jurisdiction” over all energy codes means there is no state agency enforcing the energy codes, resulting in our abysmal energy code compliance rates.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Richard Faesy: ‘Affordable’ housing and Vermont energy codes.","This commentary is by Richard Faesy, of Starksboro. He is a principal and co-founder of the Energy Futures Group. 


Building more affordable houses for Vermonters is in everyone’s interest. However, making sure that homes are energy efficient, healthy, durable and resilient so that they remain affordable over their lifetime is equally as important. Instead of only looking at the first cost, considering the year-over-year energy operating costs would also provide the best indication of true home ownership costs. Financing a little more upfront for an energy efficient home can pay for itself with energy savings that more than offset any increase in monthly mortgage payments. 
Vermont energy codes are developed with just this approach in mind; only those measures that more than pay for themselves in energy cost savings are included. Reverting back to the 2020 Residential Building Energy Standards (RBES) energy code actually makes housing less affordable than building to the more cost-effective 2024 RBES. This energy code rollback, ordered by Gov. Phil Scott on Sept. 17, not only makes housing less affordable but also means that the state will need to find other potentially more costly ways to meet our climate goals.
However, while Scott’s executive order is a setback, it could also provide an opportunity to level an uneven playing field for all builders and new construction. 
If Vermont is serious about providing affordable housing, we need to ensure that all homes are at least built to the 2020 RBES energy code. Past market assessment surveys conducted by the Vermont Department of Public Service have shown declining RBES compliance rates over the time; the most recent study, looking at homes built between 2017 and 2021, shows that only about half of new homes were built to the 2015 RBES, two code cycles behind today’s standards. This is a disservice to homeowners who are paying too much in energy costs and is unfair to those law-abiding builders who choose to build to the current energy codes.
Vermont’s lack of an “authority having jurisdiction” over all energy codes means there is no state agency enforcing the energy codes, resulting in our abysmal energy code compliance rates. Besides home buyers paying higher energy bills, builders can compete on home prices by building sub-standard homes and undercutting their legally compliant competition.
Naming a state agency such as the Division of Fire Safety to oversee both energy and building codes for all buildings in Vermont — and not just “public buildings” as is currently the case — while establishing a code enforcement system would provide consumer protection. It would also make sure all builders are playing by the same rules, make gains towards our climate goals and ensure that all of the homes our state needs to build are truly “affordable.”

(Getty Images)Frustration over utility rates and concerns about the impact of new businesses locating in Indiana have driven discussions about Indiana’s energy policy to an unprecedented but justified level of intensity in recent months. 
It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which currently account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.  
Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint, exactly why. It is a long and complex story. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.  
Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right. 
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and 50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.  
But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?
One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.
We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. In that regard, Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.  
One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.
Indiana has many advantages as we head into the future. Our location at the Crossroads of America means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward. As we consider that future, no single answer is the “right” one. It is clear that if we want different outcomes, we need to implement different approaches.  Hopefully, we choose that path.

There will soon be fewer steelhead released into Washington’s waters due to the impending closure of Skamania Hatchery. 
Located in Washougal, the hatchery produces summer and winter steelhead that are released into southwest Washington rivers for recreational fishing. 
The hatchery produces 331,000 steelhead per year, according to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Operations at Skamania Hatchery will begin to slow in in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July, as the state Department of Fish and Wildlife begins the three-year process of closing the facility. 
The Washougal and Beaver Creek hatcheries will take over some steelhead production. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates that closure of the Skamania Hatchery will reduce the total production of steelhead in Washington by 161,000 per year after factoring in the increased fish from the other facilities.
The hatchery’s closure will most strongly affect southwest Washington recreational steelhead anglers, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife announced its decision to close Skamania Hatchery in June after not receiving its full two-year budget request from the state Legislature. 
The agency had asked the Legislature for $1.9 million to maintain operations at the North Toutle and Skamania hatcheries, but only received $750,000 as lawmakers worked earlier this year to resolve a budget deficit in the $12 billion to $16 billion range. 
“This funding is far short of the amount needed to sustain current hatchery operations at both facilities,” the Department of Fish and Wildlife said in its budget request for next year. 
The North Toutle Hatchery produces Tule Fall Chinook and coho salmon. 
With only enough funding to support continued operations at one of the two hatcheries, the Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that the benefits of keeping the North Toutle Hatchery open outweighed the benefits of the Skamania Hatchery. 
Rather than asking the Legislature to backfill its initial request amid declining revenue forecasts, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is asking for $432,000 in the 2026 supplemental budget to start closing Skamania Hatchery. 
“The Department recognizes the necessity of exercising fiscal restraint this year
considering falling revenue forecasts, rising caseload costs, shifting federal impacts, and
increasing tort liabilities,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a letter to Office of Financial Management Director K.D. Chapman-See. 
Two Skamania Hatchery staff will be reassigned to the Washougal Hatchery but stay onsite at the Skamania Hatchery to oversee the three-year closure process. 
Those staff members will continue trapping and fish ladder operations for returning adult fish that were released from the hatchery as juveniles. 
Staff will finish closing the hatchery and begin decommissioning it once there are no more adult fish returning. 
Decommissioning the hatchery will involve removing any intake or other in­water structures, demolishing infrastructure and restoring habitat in the area. 
That process may take an additional six years after the hatchery closes and cost roughly $8 million, which the Department of Fish and Wildlife said will need to come from a future capital budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/485006935_1056478596514356_3017860874306171660_n-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

March 12, 2025. Submitted photo.While Michigan lawmakers had been in what felt like a never-ending stalemate on their budget negotiations for a large part of this year, the recent passage of the 2026 state budget agreement demonstrates that bipartisanship is still possible in today’s polarizing political climate. With that being said, we wish the agreement had been reached back in June and that it was a budget that truly put the people of Michigan first. 
The budget, as a whole, takes some significant positive steps toward meeting the needs of Michigan children, families and seniors. However, we recognize more work needs to get done. And Michiganders will still feel undue harm caused by federal cuts to essential programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
Reacting to the harmful federal megabill, the budget included the important step of updating state laws to protect Michigan’s ability to fund its share of Medicaid by keeping the state’s provider tax structure in place. Without this, Michigan would have had to either dig into state coffers at the expense of other priorities to maintain existing services, or it would have lost billions of dollars in Medicaid funding, restricting Michiganders’ access to health care, eliminating coverage for important services like doulas or community health workers, and disrupting our state health care system for everyone. This was necessary and we are thrilled the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took steps to protect it.
Michigan Democrats blunted the effects of Trump’s tax reforms. Now businesses are bristling.

Stronger and more equitable school funding, including an increase in per-pupil spending and increased funding focused on the students who need it most, additional funding for student mental health services, and the continuation of universal free school meals are all vital to ensuring kids have what they need to learn. We were pleased to see these things make it into the final budget agreement. An investment in technology to protect Bridge card users from benefit theft was also included as well as a significant down payment in the expansion of the successful and evidence-based Rx Kids program, which will help more Michigan babies and parents get a stronger start toward health and economic security.

While it’s positive that the Legislature looked at state revenue streams and recognized that the status quo just wasn’t good enough, we are concerned that roads were prioritized at the expense of more meaningful investments in the people of Michigan at a time when they need it most. 
Despite the budget agreement including some things that center Michiganders’ needs, more must be done to truly shield them from the harm caused by the federal megabill. The most vulnerable of Michiganders will be hit the hardest by the megabill at a time when they are already struggling to make ends meet. We know from our latest Kids Count in Michigan data released a couple of weeks ago that more than 17% of our state’s children are living in poverty, and over 40% of Michigan households are either in poverty or can’t afford the basic cost of living. 
And while early childhood is the age group that has the biggest return on investment, Michigan lawmakers largely left them out this year. We were deeply concerned that, overall, the budget lacked a holistic approach to funding the early childhood service sector and a comprehensive strategy to address the early childhood workforce shortage. 
Additionally, funding for other services, such as Early On and early literacy programs, was at best held flat or decreased at a time of growing need. What’s worse is that funding for our Great Start Collaboratives, which serve as an important resource to families through connections to services, home visiting programs and parent education, was completely eliminated, breaking a nearly two-decade-long commitment to these support systems that serve thousands of kids each year. As child care and early education programs remain out of reach for many Michigan families due to both the high cost and lack of availability, we need further investment, not stagnating funding.

Budgets are not just spreadsheets, they are moral documents, and the people of Michigan — kids, families and workers — should always be central to them. 
The agreement that was finally reached doesn’t completely miss the mark in that regard, but we had hoped to see more people-centered investments to mitigate more of the harm caused by federal funding cuts to programs Michigan families and our local communities rely upon to stay healthy and thriving. In the face of increases in child care costs, rising housing costs and unknown future health care costs, our state lawmakers need to continue to champion policies that will protect Michiganders from what we know are going to be some extremely challenging times ahead.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)After three executions in less than a year — ending a nearly 15-year pause in Indiana’s use of capital punishment — it’s not clear when the state will carry out another.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. 
No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
While prosecutors say there are still appropriate cases for capital punishment, local jurisdictions are increasingly weighing when those charges are best pursued compared to life-without-parole sentences, especially given the legal costs and the length of appeals.
“Prosecutors are using this only when absolutely necessary,” said Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull. “Justice sometimes demands it — but it must also be reliable, fair and certain.”
There’s no timeline for the next execution — it’s up to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office to request execution dates from the state supreme court.
The future of execution methods is also unclear, given mounting scrutiny over how much Indiana taxpayers have paid for the lethal injection drug pentobarbital used in the state’s three most recent executions.
 Who remains on Indiana’s death row
Indiana’s remaining condemned inmates are housed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
Eric D. Holmes was sentenced in 1993 for a double murder during a 1989 robbery at a Marion County Shoney’s restaurant. Holmes and an accomplice ambushed three former coworkers, killing two with knives. His federal habeas appeal was denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case.
Kevin Isom was sentenced in 2013 for killing his wife, Cassandra, and her two teenage children in Gary in 2007. He fired at responding officers before a SWAT team took him into custody. His case remains under federal habeas corpus review.
Jeffrey Weisheit was sentenced in 2013 for the deaths of two children in Vanderburgh County. Prosecutors said he bound and gagged 5-year-old Caleb and 8-year-old Alyssa Lynch before setting his home on fire. His most recent federal appeal was denied in 2023.
William Clyde Gibson III, sentenced in separate cases in 2013 and 2014 for killing three women — Karen Hodella, Stephanie Kirk and Christine Whitis — in Floyd County. Each was strangled to death in 2012. His appeals are ongoing in federal court.
Michael Dean Overstreet was sentenced in 2000 for the 1997 kidnapping, rape and murder of 18-year-old Kelly Eckart in Johnson County. He was declared mentally incompetent for execution in 2014, effectively suspending his death sentence unless a future court finds him competent.
Three others who were long listed on Indiana’s death row — Joseph Corcoran, Benjamin Ritchie and Roy Ward — have since been executed. 
Corcoran was executed in December 2024 for the 1997 killings of four men in Fort Wayne — one brother and three friends — marking Indiana’s first execution since 2009.
Ritchie was executed in May for the 2000 shooting death of Beech Grove Police Officer William Toney.
And Ward was put to death earlier this month for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County, marking the state’s third execution in twelve months.
Pending capital cases
No new inmates have been added to Indiana’s death row since 2013. But several defendants across the state currently face capital murder charges.
According to data from the Indiana Supreme Court and county filings, four defendants have pending death penalty cases: John Adams in Marion County; Carl Boards II in Madison County; Orlando Mitchell in Marion County; and Dalonny Rodgers in Hendricks County.
County prosecutors have not filed any new death penalty cases in 2025, as of mid-October. 
Over the past five years, filings have been limited to between one and three capital cases per year — a decline from the 1990s and early 2000s, when multiple capital prosecutions often ran simultaneously, according to state data. 
Three new death penalty cases were filed in 2021, two in 2022, two in 2023 and one in 2024, Supreme Court data shows.
Prosecutors weigh costs, time and other factors
Mull chairs the Indiana Prosecuting Attorney Council’s Complex Litigation Committee that advises Hoosier prosecutors on capital cases, law enforcement shootings and other highly complicated cases. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that prosecutors reserve death penalty filings for “the worst of the worst offenders.”
“These cases are filed where we have very strong and incontrovertible proof of guilt,” Mull said. “We do not want to be a state where we have someone who is wrongfully put on death row.”

He noted that while justice sometimes requires pursuing the death penalty, prosecutors also weigh a defendant’s mental condition and the toll that lengthy appeals take on victims’ families.
“Many families simply don’t want to go through decades of appeals and hearings,” Mull said. “They want closure. Life without parole often accomplishes that.”
Costs of capital litigation are another consideration.
“These cases can run into the millions of dollars over time,” he said. “Counties generally get reimbursed for a percentage of that by the state, but it can still leave taxpayers locally on the hook for a huge amount of money.”
Death penalty prosecutions can cost counties millions to litigate, depending on how long the case remains active.
Multiple state studies — including a 2010 review by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — have found that a death penalty case in Indiana costs about five times more than a comparable case seeking life without parole, largely because of the extra trials, legal motions, expert witnesses and appeals required.
The Indiana Abolition Coalition further points to counties that have been forced to raise taxes or divert road funds to cover the costs of single capital prosecutions that later resulted in life sentences instead.
Under Indiana law, counties can seek 50% reimbursement for defense costs in death penalty cases through the Indiana Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys.
Marion, Madison and Wayne counties collectively received more than $230,000 capital reimbursements during the 2024–25 fiscal year for ongoing cases, according to the CCAA’s latest annual report.
Statewide, capital reimbursements totaled about $197,000 in fiscal year 2022–23 and $312,000 in 2023–24, according to CCAA data.
Mull emphasized that the state’s appellate process can take decades, contributing to delays that frustrate families and communities. He suggested lawmakers consider legislation to shorten appellate timelines, arguing that “citizens and victims have a right to speedy justice,” just as defendants do.
“There’s no reason it should take 10 or 20 years to determine whether it was a fair trial,” he said.
Questions over Indiana’s execution drugs
The state resumed executions last year using pentobarbital, a single drug protocol also used by the federal government.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office has refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months.
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets will expire at the end of the month, according to court documents.

The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Over the past year, Braun and several Republican lawmakers have discussed potential alternatives to lethal injection amid ongoing shortages and legal challenges.
Some have floated legislation to authorize nitrogen hypoxia, mirroring Alabama’s new method, while others have proposed a review of whether the state should keep the death penalty at all.
Bills to abolish capital punishment have been filed in recent sessions but have not received hearings.
Federal death row in Terre Haute
Indiana is also home to the nation’s only federal execution chamber, located in the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. The facility gained national attention during the final months of the first Trump administration, when officials carried out 13 executions there between 2020 and 2021.
Today, only three men remain on federal death row — two of them housed in Terre Haute. The third, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing, is being held in Colorado because of what Bureau of Prisons officials have described as “unique security management requirements.”
Federal executions have been paused since 2021, though, when former President Joe Biden ordered a moratorium to review the government’s use of pentobarbital. In December 2024, Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 of the 40 men who were then on federal death row, converting their punishments to life without parole.
He did not commute the sentences of Tsarnaev; Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston church; and Robert Bowers, convicted in the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.
Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restart executions in Terre Haute and directed Justice Department officials to assist state prosecutors interested in re-trying Biden clemency recipients in states that retain the death penalty.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. Sign up to receive their biggest stories. 
When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.
Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”
‘Authoritarian playbook’
Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.
Where the fallout is felt
The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
In plain sight
Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Mikie Sherrill has enlisted prominent national Democratic lawmakers to boost her bid for governor, a strategy her GOP rival has not adopted.","Rep.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Prominent Democratic lawmakers are hitting the campaign trail to stump for Rep. Mikie Sherrill in her bid to become New Jersey’s next governor, a strategy election observers say is intended to secure the support of voters who loathe President Donald Trump.
Former President Barack Obama cut an ad for Sherrill that debuted last week. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona have campaigned in New Jersey for Sherrill. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore went door-knocking with her on Sunday in Newark. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer championed Sherrill for union members in Paramus Saturday.
“I may not be from here, but let me tell you, New Jerseyans are a lot like Michiganders. We work hard, we’re tough, we want the best for each other. You’re loud, you’re proud, and you don’t eff around,” Whitmer said. “This is a clear choice: We got a guy who’s going to get bossed around by D.C, versus a woman who can get sh*t done. We got a bad actor who’s willing to sell you out, or a badass Navy pilot who will take on any woman who messes with New Jersey.”
Thousands protest Donald Trump at New Jersey No Kings rallies

Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and executive director of the FDU Poll, said enlisting Democrats’ most notable national names earns Sherrill media coverage while also helping her overcome lackluster support among some Democratic factions and reinforce her message that she will fight the Trump administration.
“She understands that perhaps people aren’t excited to vote for her, but they will crawl over broken glass to vote against Donald Trump. And so she’s doing everything she can to try and make it seem like voting for Mikie Sherrill is voting against Donald Trump,” Cassino said. “If you’re trying to nationalize the race, bringing in national figures helps to do that and helps to build her narrative of saying, ‘This is a national race, not a local race.’”
It’s a strategy other Democratic candidates have embraced too, with Jersey City mayoral hopeful Mussab Ali this season touting endorsements from Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).
Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s Republican rival, has brought in several GOP VIPs, including MAGA influencers like Scott Pressler and Jack Posobiec, who appeared at a Ciattarelli rally earlier this month in Wildwood, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who appeared with Ciattarelli at the Saddle Brook Diner last Wednesday. Posobiec again joined Ciattarelli in Dumont on Sunday.
But Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has not had lawmakers with higher name ID at his side the way Sherrill has. Observers say that’s probably deliberate.

Bringing in national politicians to campaign with him doesn’t quite square with Ciattarelli’s favorite line that he’s a lifelong Jersey guy focused solely on the Garden State while Sherrill is an out-of-stater who may have higher aspirations, said Ashley Koning, a political science professor at Rutgers University and director of its Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.
Many GOP politicians nationally have become so polarizing that inviting them to campaign here becomes a “difficult dance” for Ciattarelli, Koning added.
With a moderate Republican at his side, he could irritate the White House, an unwise move considering Trump endorsed him, she said. Yet a more conservative Republican campaigning for him risks alienating undecided voters in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000 and unaffiliated voters comprise over a third of all registered voters, she said.
“It is so hard to pinpoint what kind of national Republican would play well with voters in New Jersey right now, because at least historically, we’ve had a very different brand of Republicanism than is being executed on the national stage right now,” Koning said.
She added: “Even if they have their party base on their side and with increases in Republican registration, he still likely needs independents to cross the finish line.”
The Sherrill campaign’s choice of backers — moderate Democrats instead of more polarizing politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) — is also likely intentional, Cassino and Koning agreed.
“These are obviously kind of popular, or not really controversial, political figures, at least among Democrats and independents,” Koning said.
While persuading popular lawmakers to stand beside her bolsters Sherrill’s cachet as a four-term congresswoman, it also underscores an unsavory reality about politics — money motivates, Cassino said.
Donors might be more generous seeing big-name politicians support her, while those politicians might hope Sherrill returns the favor someday, he said. Gateway to Leadership, a Sherrill-affiliated leadership PAC, raised nearly $400,000 in the 2023-24 election cycle and donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and groups, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks campaign finance.
“Mikie Sherrill is a very prolific fundraiser, and so other politicians want to be on her good side because she might be giving them money at some point. It’s not a quid pro quo, but it is definitely something that makes her more popular and makes people want to come out in support of her,” he said.
If nothing else, luring big-name politicians to New Jersey can make the race more interesting, said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. Voters from both major parties are used to hearing from state party leaders but don’t often get to see or interact with national leaders, he added.
“This is a fun chance to meet national figures who they read about, see on TV, and follow on social media,” Rasmussen said. “I don’t think there’s a serious risk for the campaigns — there’s always the possibility of backlash for a controversial position or a misspeak, but these are experienced, polished leaders who aren’t looking to jam up themselves or anyone else.”
Whoever the candidates line up to stump for them, though, doesn’t signify anything about how the race is going, observers said.
“I know we’re all trying to read the tea leaves,” Cassino said. “But the candidates are just as much in the dark as the rest of us are.”
Ciattarelli campaign spokesman Eric Arpert said Sherrill’s reliance on out-of-state Democratic lawmakers is an attempt to “save her failing final efforts.”
“She’ll never understand the problems we face, and can’t be trusted to fix them. Jack’s campaign continues to be about delivering the positive change New Jersey so desperately needs, and it’s why our momentum and energy continue to grow,” he said.
Asked in Paramus whether enlisting Democratic lawmakers from other states illustrates Ciattarelli’s frequent attack line that he is from New Jersey and she is not, Sherrill said she thinks people “know what I’m focused on.”
“I have been directly focused on driving down costs for families and running on my record of effectiveness and ruthless confidence, if you will, and of course my opponent continues to run away from his record, while at the same time supporting Trump, who is driving up costs for everyone. That seems to be resonating with people,” she said.

And what about the Royals, the other team state lawmakers were hoping to convince to stay in Missouri when they created the subsidy program?  Crickets. 
A ballot summary prepared by Hoskins’ office for a pair of proposed initiative petitions seeking to repeal the stadium funding law declares that voter approval could “likely cause the Kansas City Chiefs to move their stadium from Missouri to Kansas.”
There is no mention of the Royals, an omission that sparked a flurry of questions — and criticism. 
Does Hoskins have some reason to believe the Royals have already decided to leave the state or have no intention of using the stadium tax incentives? 
Or, as critics allege, is Hoskins hoping to sink the measure by making predictions about the future plans of the Chiefs, who — unlike the Royals — have a statewide fanbase, three recent championships, and a star player in Patrick Mahomes who is the face of the sport?
The Secretary of State’s Office insists it has neither inside knowledge of the Royals’ intentions nor a desire to bias voters against the proposed repeal. In a statement, the office said it “does not have access to or knowledge of the private business decisions of any professional sports franchise,” and that the ballot summary must reflect the “clearest, most immediate potential consequence” of the law.
Besides, Hoskins’ office said, the current version of the summary is just the “first bite at the apple.” A recently approved state law gives the secretary of state up to three times to get the ballot language right — if proponents are upset enough about the first version to take the issue to court. 
Brad Ketcher, a lawyer working with the group behind the ballot measure to repeal the subsidy, believes that’s the point. Writing an unfair ballot summary forces backers of initiative petitions to invest the time and money into legal challenges that could otherwise be dedicated to gathering signatures or engaging with voters. 
“Hoskins is all but admitting,” Ketcher said, “that he drafted flawed language with an eye toward slowing the measure.”
Lawsuit, threat of criminal charges part of GOP effort to block vote on Missouri map

Over the last month, Hoskins has found himself at the center of the political storm, facing criticism — and lawsuits — over his office’s role in the initiative petition and referendum process. 
Hoskins has used his authority to pre-emptively reject 100,000 signatures for a proposed referendum on Missouri’s new congressional map. He’s also come under fire for crafting what critics call “deceptive and prejudicial” summary statements for two public‐education related constitutional amendments. 
He was tasked with rewriting the ballot language for a proposal to reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban after a Cole County judge determined the initial wording by lawmakers failed to alert voters that the amendment would ban most abortions. 
But his initial draft was rejected when the judge determined it was “insufficient and unfair.” Hoskins got the judge’s sign off on the summary on his next attempt. 
Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist in Missouri, filed a lawsuit earlier this year asking a judge to strike down a new law that says any ballot language deemed insufficient or unfair by a court must be sent back to the secretary of state up to three times for revision. If, after three attempts, the courts still find the language unacceptable, a judge is then allowed to rewrite it themselves.
Nicholson said Hoskins’ behavior is exactly why the law is so dangerous and should be overturned.
“Denny Hoskins is required to write fair and impartial language,” Nicholson said. “But instead, he is reinforcing all the concerns people had when the legislature passed the law, that a bad-faith politician could use it to waste the people’s time and resources.” 
As for the Chiefs and Royals, their future — in Missouri or Kansas — remains unresolved. 
“We have heard nothing to indicate that the Royals have decided to leave the State of Missouri,” said Gabby Picard, a spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, whose office plays no role in the intuitive petition process, when asked about the team’s omission from the ballot summary.
“In fact,” Picard said, “Gov. Kehoe and his team remain in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs to ensure that both teams stay in Missouri — where they belong.”
The teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums in Jackson County expire in 2030. Kansas lawmakers put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
The Missouri plan would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties. The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
Missouri AG, General Assembly seek to dismiss lawsuit against stadium funding bill

A pair of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit hoping to get the entire package thrown out, arguing it violates the constitution by including multiple provisions and aid to private interests. 
The initiative petitions aiming to repeal the stadium subsidy seek to direct any money saved toward preventing cuts to Medicaid that could result from legislation passed this summer by Congress. 
Hoskins, Ketcher alleges, “has chosen to protect billions for billionaire sports team owners at the expense of everyday Missourians and their health care.” 
For his part, Hoskins defended his work — and his team loyalties. 
“Secretary Hoskins applauds the Royals on a hard-fought season and, like many Missourians, is cheering on the Chiefs this football season,” his office said in a statement. “Regardless of team colors, the goal remains the same: ensuring Missouri voters have the facts they need to make an informed decision at the ballot box.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

They need to make it the highest priority.","Classroom coaching is a proven strategy that improves reading scores with relatively little investment, by hiring coaches to work one-on-one with teachers on how they can improve their students' reading, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Education)Most teachers aren’t taught to teach reading. They should be and they’re supposed to be. And you would think they are.
There are many programs to teach them, spanning roughly pre-service college undergraduate and graduate degrees, certification/licensure, in-service guidance manuals, classroom coaching and “professional learning” sessions (which are short and scattershot).
Yet, the evidence is incontrovertible that the great majority of teachers haven’t been brought up to speed to teach reading, which is a lot more demanding than you think.
Still, no surprise, there’s no ready fix. Improvements in each of the training modes are necessary.
But there is one reform that can be a gamechanger: It’s classroom coaching that allows well-trained coaches to work one-on-one with classroom teachers.
In fact, classroom coaches are key drivers in state Superintendent Carey Wright’s flagship early literacy initiative. Wright, who came to nationwide fame for the remarkable increase in literacy that occurred when she was state superintendent in Mississippi, cites classroom coaches as a vital, if not indispensable, feature of the “Mississippi miracle.”

The job description for coaches encompasses in class-support, modeling instructional strategies, and helping teachers analyze data on student performance. At the same time, the coaching must be custom-tailored to each teacher’s strengths and weaknesses. All of which require that the ratio of coaches to classroom teachers be realistic.  Beware the educational curse of programs that are a mile wide and an inch deep.
In Mississippi, Wright took the bold, and probably unprecedented, step of scouring local districts for good coach candidates, then hired them as state employees under her direct supervision. She intends to pull off the same feat in Maryland — if funds are available.
She and the state board of education are making an all-out effort to corral funding. At the last session of the General Assembly, the Maryland State Department of Education’s priority request included kindergarten to third grade literacy coaches, but it was not funded. MSDE intends to resubmit the request at the coming session.
For now, Wright is making a start with the Comprehensive State Literacy Development Grants Project. The $40 million federal grant over five years is being channeled to local school districts for literacy initiatives, with coaching a leading priority.
In addition, she is pitching coaching to foundations. So far, funding has been obtained for pilot coaching in one local district.
Unfortunately, the prospects for more funding from Annapolis, especially for coaches to work with a reasonable number of classroom teachers, are not bright. Requests for more money are a political no-no these days because of the state’s fiscal problems.
Nonetheless, funding for coaches would require only a relatively small amount of funding. By rough calculation, $30 million would be a significant down payment on the number of classroom literacy coaches needed statewide.
At the same time, it is essential that the funding be additional state aid, not funding diverted from other Blueprint initiatives. Bear in mind that classroom instruction is almost in a class by itself in current underfunding under the Blueprint. The Kirwan Commission and the Blueprint missed the boat in failing to provide funding earmarked for them — a fatal flaw, unless corrected.
As things now stand, classroom coaching poses a litmus test of whether Annapolis means what it says when it proclaims support for early literacy — the gateway to fulfillment of the Blueprint and student success.
So, Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly: Invest in early literacy, with classroom coaches the highest priority, and our schoolchildren (and taxpayers) will get the greatest dividends.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US-Dept-Education-photo-tutoring-1.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

What is the endgame? What are the real goals behind the suppression and gutting of the processes that have been the bedrock of the democratic process in America?
Endgame is not just a short or long-term effect or result. It means the final, decisive stage of any strategic activity.
What do you think the final result will be of some of the disturbing and questionably illegal actions occurring in the halls of government in our state and nation?
In Missouri, what is the endgame of a governor who follows the dictates of a national Republican agenda when it comes to denying abortion care, signing a redistricting map whose origin is in question and making direct participation in the democratic process more difficult, if not impossible — all of which are contrary and diametrically opposed to the will of the majority of Missourians?
What is the endgame?
When all is said and done, what life might be like for Missourians cannot be minimized.
Typically, we see damaging legislation, policies and budget cuts as cyclical, and find some measure of comfort. We believe and hope that changes will occur in the next election cycle and things could get better with a new incoming administration.
Given the political climate we are in, with the rapid and extreme changes taking place at the state and national level, there is a greater chance that recovery might be extremely difficult, or worse, might never occur.
Our state and Congressional representatives willingly give tacit and overt approval of what appears to be arbitrary policy changes, budget cuts, new tariffs and other measures that hurt many Missourians. Will the effects be short-term or lasting?
That’s especially true when it comes to the cuts in Medicaid, which will deny many Missourians needed health care and other services, as well as result in the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers, eliminating access to critically-needed medical treatment.
Or when it comes to farmers not having access to markets to sell their produce, running the risk of losing farms that have been in families for generations.
Or when it comes to being able to deal with the rising costs of groceries and other consumer goods.
Are these current conditions temporary or do they represent the quality of life to come?
On the national level, what is the endgame when our branches of government — executive, legislative and judicial — repeatedly disregard their role and responsibilities, then abuse, capitulate or totally forfeit their constitutional powers when it comes to executing and protecting the integrity of our democracy?
Will the disregard for the rule of law be a short-term occurrence with this administration or will it become the norm of future administrations?
Paying close attention to what is occurring in the legislative halls and the streets in cities and states across America should compel us all to ask: what is the endgame?
When we are constantly bombarded with lies, distortions, divisive name-calling, hate speech, coming from the very political leaders who should be promoting collaboration and finding solutions — Is this just temporary?
Or will it result in a total collapse of our political values, traditions, civic culture and civility itself.
Just as important: what is our game plan to make sure all the disregard for the democratic principles and laws that define America is short-term and short-lived?
Teams that survive and ultimately win do not leave their game plan up to chance. They do not just sit idlily by, watch and hope that the opposing team gives up their fight and loses the game.
They become intimately familiar with the tactics and plays of the opposing team.
Teams that win also have an offensive and defensive game plan and strategies to counter the opposing team that they commit to and consistently employ.
For those of us who do not like the game we are in, and the possible long-term results, we need to determine our own desired endgame.
What will it be?
What team will you be on?

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)When patients struggling with opioid addiction walk into the newly opened Community Medical Services (CMS) clinic on Milwaukee’s South Side, “we want them to feel that this is a space for healing and growth,” said Amanda Maria De Leon, regional community impact manager for CMS. The clinic provides therapy and medication-assisted treatment for people working to stabilize their lives after addiction.
Medication-assisted treatment involves medications like Methadone to control opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Together with therapy, medication-assisted treatment allows patients to begin to stabilize and repair their lives. Although studies have associated medication-assisted treatment with reductions in overdoses and other improved recovery outcomes, its use also carries stigma. Confronting that social disapproval, while also providing a comfortable environment for patients, is part of the mission of CMS.

Walking into the clinic, patients are met with an open waiting room and ample seating. There is a small area with toys for young children in one corner, and across the room nurses sit at a desk waiting to check in patients. Hanging over the small play area is a plaque dedicated to a young girl who spoke at one of the city zoning hearings in favor of the clinic opening. De Leon explained that the girl, who was 8 years old at the time, had befriended a local unhoused man to whom she’d given food. “She knew he needed treatment,” De Leon told the Wisconsin Examiner, saying the girl told the zoning board, “I want them to open this clinic for my friend.” 
Around a corner from the lobby, behind a set of protective glass windows, nurses dispense liquid methadone into small cups for patients on a daily basis. Walls and therapy rooms throughout the facility are painted calming  blues and  greens, and feature art or motivational messages. Small, decorative coffee tables sit between two small couches large enough for one or two people to sit facing each other. 
“We create a space like this intentionally, because we don’t want a patient to feel like it’s a transaction,” De Leon told the Examiner. She said that the facility is designed to be therapeutic both to the patients and the staff, to mitigate burnout.

Dr. Dan Lemieux, one of the medical doctors at CMS, said that he’s “used to the hustle and bustle” of a clinic. His background began in family medicine, where Lemieux was used to seeing 20-25 patients each day. Over time he also began working in Suboxone treatment programs. “I think about eight years ago I kind of pulled back on family medicine a little bit and did a little more time in addiction,” Lemieux told the Wisconsin Examiner. “I found it more gratifying, enjoyed helping people a little bit more.” Lemieux began working at methadone clinics after the COVID-19 pandemic and found his way to CMS, where he has worked for about two years. 
Lemieux has worked as the medical director of CMS clinics in West Allis, Madison, Fond du Lac, and now the Southside Milwaukee Clinic. Recalling the workload at West Allis, Lemieux told the the Examiner, “I think the counselors are really good at just keeping the flow going, and the front desk staff. So it never seemed overwhelming or busy, and the clients are always very appreciative.” Lemieux said he likes the highly focused sessions in recovery work, because “you can really spend your time kind of helping the client with those particular issues.” 
Overdose deaths driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl began skyrocketing in Milwaukee County around 2016, claiming hundreds of lives annually. New records for overdose deaths were set and broken every year from 2018 to 2022, when the death toll peaked at 674 lives lost. Nearly 5,800 non-fatal overdoses occurred that same year, according to the county’s overdose dashboard.

Recently, as new programs and services were established to stem the tide, overdoses began to decline. Last year there were 450 overdose deaths in Milwaukee, so far there have been fewer than half that number this year. CMS is  one of the many organizations on the frontlines of the crisis, both as a treatment clinic and as a harm-reduction advocacy organization. 
De Leon showcased a storage room full of boxes of hygiene kits, testing strips for both fentanyl and the tranquilizer xylazine (a more recent trend in the drug market), and Narcan (used to reverse an overdose), all of which are either used or distributed by the CMS outreach team. Sometimes staff visit homeless encampments and food pantries, other times they hold pop-up events in areas with high overdose rates. The team even organized a sober tailgate at American Family Field at a Milwaukee Brewers game and distributed over 1,200 tickets. 
“We just deliver a little hope,” said De Leon. “Hopefully when you’re feeling a little better you’ll walk into a door of a treatment center. We don’t care where you walk into.” CMS also works with numerous partner organizations including the Milwaukee Overdose Response Initiative (MORI), various fire departments, the West Allis overdose response team and other nodes along an evolving network. 
De Leon said the network has become bigger and more collaborative. At an open house CMS held at  the new clinic, dozens of people showed up, she said, including community members, firefighters and police officers from multiple departments, probation and parole representatives and treatment providers. “I was speechless,” said De Leon. “We had over 70 people show up to our open house…That would have never happened in a methadone treatment world 20 years ago.”

“We’re breaking down silos, we’re educating people,” she added. Today, people have easier access to methadone treatment programs. In Milwaukee County, both the jail and the Community Reintegration Center (formerly known as the House of Corrections) have medication-assisted treatment programs. De Leon stressed that when people are taken to correctional facilities they should tell staff whether they need medication-assisted treatment in order to access those programs. 
The West Allis Fire Department became the first to carry Buprenorphine, which is given to people after reviving them from an overdose to stop sudden withdrawal symptoms. Bipartisan legislation at the state level legalized both fentanyl and xylazine testing strips.
Nevertheless, stigma associated with both addiction and medication-assisted treatment creates barriers to progress. Although CMS has clinics in the cities of West Allis and South Milwaukee, its new clinic is the first it has been able to open in the city of Milwaukee itself. The opening marked an end to years of contentious meetings with the city’s zoning board and local residents. Now, patients living near the South Side won’t need to travel far, and the new clinic could also lighten patient loads at other clinics.

Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic, who represents the district where the new CMS clinic is located, said she supports the treatment center opening. “I strongly supported this facility opening in our community,” Dimitrijevic told the  Examiner. “Providing residents with nearby access to needed health care and harm reduction tools makes us all safer and healthier. I am proud to have led by example on this issue by welcoming CMS to our community and am grateful for their work serving our residents.” 
Another clinic is expected to open up on Milwaukee’s North Side in early 2026. But many people are not sold on medication-assisted treatment, fentanyl testing strips and overdose-reversing medications. In 2023, when the city of Milwaukee’s zoning board approved the North Side clinic, reactions from the community were split. Leadership from the fire departments of Milwaukee and West Allis spoke in favor of CMS opening a clinic, stressing the dire need for relief and treatment access across Milwaukee County. 
Others called treatment centers “predatory” and expressed concerns about the clinic’s   for-profit business model. 
At least one 2014 study, which analyzed self-reported services from disease testing to psychiatric care, found that for-profit providers “were significantly less likely than nonprofit and public programs to offer comprehensive services”. The study said that “interventions to increase the offering of comprehensive services are needed, particularly among for-profit programs.”

Other objections to the new clinic came from neighbors who  argued that opening the clinic would hurt their property values and quality of life. A corporate representative and a real estate attorney from the Vin Baker Treatment Center, a facility named for a Milwaukee Bucks player that is located on N. 76th Street in Milwaukee, said that CMS would disrupt its business, jeopardizing a $3 million investment into the Vin Baker center. Ald. Lamont Westmoreland, who represents a North Side district, also opposed CMS,  referring to city planning documents which recommended against opening social service businesses in the area. “I support treatment facilities, just not at this particular location,” Westmoreland said before the center opened. 
John Koch, national director of community and public relations at CMS, explained that CMS is a for-profit entity with private equity backing. Koch said that the private equity investment, coupled with grants, has allowed the clinic to scale up to address the overdose crisis. opening new treatment centers, providing grants to extend clinic hours and embedding staff with local fire departments and homeless outreach programs for harm reduction. CMS bills Medicaid and other patient insurance to cover  patient care, “and 90% of our people are on Medicaid”, Koch told the Examiner. “We work very heavily with Medicaid. And then outside of that we receive grants to open new projects.” 
The private equity backing allows for “continuous investment back into the company to address the opioid epidemic as it’s needed,” said Koch. “If we were Ma and Popping it and just growing non-profit style, it’s so much slower and we would never be able to match the need.” CMS has opened seven clinics across Wisconsin, with over 70 clinics operating nationwide. “What we’ve been able to do is be innovative with our money, and meet people where they’re at,” said Koch. “So that’s our secret sauce, is using funds to just continue to provide more access to treatment. If we did not have private equity backing, we would never have been able to be this big, or be treating 30,000 people…That’s what’s allowed us to beat the opioid epidemic.”

Koch knows firsthand how treatment access can be the feather on the scale deciding life or death. In 2013, he was living on the streets of Chicago struggling with a heroin addiction. One night, not long after completing his second adult prison sentence, Koch encountered a police officer who saw that he needed help and gave him the number to a treatment center. Koch went the next day to begin recovery, which also included medication-assisted treatment. Today Koch is raising a family  and works to give people the second chance he got years ago. 
Despite such success stories, there is still public skepticism about medication-assisted treatment. De Leon recalled a conversation she had after making a presentation on harm reduction at a national conference. “This guy came up to me and said, ‘You know, you really changed my thinking,’” she said. He mentioned that in some cases people on probation or parole are expected to get off methadone in order to be fully released from supervision, despite the fact that he’s seen it significantly improve people’s lives.

De Leon asked why people were being forced to get off methadone and the man replied, “Well, nobody should be on these medications for the rest of their life.” She countered that if someone is finally stable after decades of addiction then, “Why not?…Would you tell me to get off of my insulin?” The man said no. “Then why would you tell somebody to get off of lifesaving medication that has him the most stable he’s ever been?” People are free to work on tapering off if they choose, but the priority should be stabilizing and saving a life, she argued. 
Dr. Lemieux said that he’s also seen medication-assisted treatment make a difference. “It’s always a tough conversation to try and change minds,” Lemieux told the Examiner. “Just the data that comes out shows that people in recovery are getting jobs, they’re reuniting with family, they’re working more, crime goes down, and it’s just a win. They’re getting their lives back, and just being a part of that is very rewarding and amazing. I just hope that more people see this, realize this, and reducing deaths is just another huge point, too.”

The department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. But it’s unclear where budgeters may want to cut. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers scrutinize Health Department ahead of budget session appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s 2026 budget session is still four months away, but lawmakers are already scrutinizing the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget. 
At $2.2 billion in the current budget, the department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. And some lawmakers are concerned about what may lie in Wyoming’s financial future. 
“Wyoming is headed toward an impending fiscal cliff that is caused by what I believe is unsustainable spending,” Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft said last month at the first meeting of the newly formed Subcommittee on the Wyoming Department of Health Budget. 
In August, Pendergraft made a motion at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting to form the subcommittee, which he now chairs. He sought five meetings. Two of those have already taken place — one in Casper, another online. 
“This has been a fact-finding thing,” Pendergraft told WyoFile. “This isn’t a grudge match. This isn’t going out and trying to hack with a meat cleaver or anything. But the necessity may well be there — that we’re going to be forced to do some cutting. And if that is the case, we want to do so as judiciously as possible.”
At the end of this month, state financial forecasters will release revenue projections to coincide with the governor’s budget preparations. Those estimates will then be revised in January to provide the latest data to lawmakers, who hold the state’s purse strings. Both reports will give a clearer picture of the state’s financial footing. 
Forecasters have long cautioned lawmakers in their CREG reports of the shakiness of the state’s economic picture. Wyoming’s revenue streams are slowly diversifying, but in the process, the state has grown more reliant on its investment portfolio as well as oil and gas production — all of which come with higher volatility than coal. 
While lawmakers wait for the latest forecast, Pendergraft said it’s important to be prepared to make tough choices. 
“We don’t want this to catch us kind of by surprise, like it did in 2017, like it did in 2021,” Pendergraft said. 
In 2017, a fossil-fuel bust resulted in an 8% across-the-board cut to the state budget. And on the heels of the COVID pandemic, Gov. Mark Gordon signed a budget in 2021 that included over $430 million in cuts and the elimination of more than 300 state positions. 
“We wanted to learn from those experiences and not repeat bad mistakes if possible,” Pendergraft said. 
The formation of the subcommittee also reflects changing political winds at the statehouse. 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers create a two-year budget, and 2026 will mark the first budget session since the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the lower chamber in the 2024 election. With that victory, caucus members and allies, including Pendergraft, comprise all but one member of the House Appropriations Committee. The panel has considerable power since it gets the first crack at the budget alongside its Senate counterparts. 
In April, the caucus announced it aimed to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget by identifying unconstitutional and wasteful spending.” 
Altogether, another budget showdown could be in the works — with the Department of Health’s comparatively large budget at the center of it. 
In 2024, the Senate passed the budget by just two votes after most Freedom Caucus members and allies voted against it in the House. In a surprise and unprecedented move earlier this year, the Senate refused to pass a supplemental budget after the two chambers split on several spending policies. 
The subcommittee’s meetings have so far contrasted with the caustic budget fights of the last few years. The tone has been cordial and data has driven much of the conversation as Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson has walked the committee through the ins and outs of the agency’s mission and budget at the last two meetings.

In September, Johansson guided the subcommittee — which, alongside Pendergraft, includes Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen and Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood — through each of the department’s four divisions. 
Approximately 95% of the department’s budget covers medical services, including via facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, the Life Resource Center in Lander and the Veterans Home in Buffalo. The other 5% accounts for administrative costs, such as claims processing and state employee salaries. 
Wyoming has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, so the federal-state health insurance program is reserved for certain low-income and medically needy individuals and families. As of August, 66,225 Wyoming residents are enrolled in Medicaid — 61% are children. 
Like other state-federal programs, for every dollar Wyoming spends on Medicaid, the federal government contributes a matching amount. Those kinds of matching funds can restrict lawmakers — if the state doesn’t spend, the federal government doesn’t match. 
“There are some constraints within that budget … that are important to consider when looking at the budget overall,” Elizabeth Martineau, senior fiscal analyst with the Legislative Service Office, told the subcommittee in September. 
Martineau pointed to, for example, the preschool services unit of the state’s budget. 
“If you don’t meet that maintenance of effort, you could lose those funds,” she said. 
Likewise, investing in community mental health services can save the state money in other areas, Andy Summerville of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers, told the committee. 
Community mental health centers are a large item in the department’s budget, Summerville said, but their budget has remained mostly flat since 2002, mostly between $50 and $55 million per year. 
“One of the unique characteristics of the community mental health centers is that part of the behavioral health redesign mission is diversion away from state institutions,” Summerville said. “It’s diversion away from the state hospital, life resource center, keeping people in their communities, working with the criminal justice population much more strongly now, trying to keep them out of jail or reduce recidivism.” 
Separately, health officials and many county sheriffs are pushing lawmakers to support legislation to boost treatment for mentally ill people detained in county jails while they wait for a bed at the state hospital. 
Pat Sweeney, a former Republican lawmaker from Casper, also testified to the committee. He was a member of the House in both 2017 and 2021. 
“During the pandemic, Department of Health did an unbelievable job trying to manage that,” Sweeney said. “But did our citizens suffer because of it? Yes.”
Pendergraft asked Sweeney if he had “any large regrets” from the times the Legislature had to cut. 
“I think we could have been maybe a little more strategic than across the board,” Sweeney said.
The subcommittee’s next meeting is Nov. 7 in Casper.

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Rather than continuing the chaotic annual strategy of throwing everything  but the kitchen sink at Oklahoma’s failing public school system, it’s clear that we need leaders with the vision to develop a 10-year roadmap.
Because I don’t know about you, but over the past decade, it’s felt like we’ve careened from one crisis to another. And somehow we’ve ended up with lawmakers who haven’t been particularly visionary on the public school front, and who have preferred a scattershot approach to tackling whatever happens to be the latest predicament. 
Take the 2025 legislative session, for instance. They weighed or passed laws dealing with cellphone bans, overhauling federally protected individualized education plans, ending virtual school days, mandating recess, free college tuition for the children of long-time teachers, overhauling how school boards operate, tutoring incentives, teacher pipeline grants, extending the educator salary schedule and expanding educator testing requirements. And late in session, lawmakers decided to add an extra day of school to the year in exchange for a seemingly random $25 million in new funding. (Yes, we were confused, too.)
And that’s all completely separate from the havoc now ex-state Superintendent Ryan Walters added to the mix. After the session ended, he randomly demanded the end of standardized testing and that schools begin providing free lunches to students – without additional funding to buy that food.
I cannot imagine how destabilizing all this chaos must be to school administrators, staff, teachers and our children, who are always having to pivot because our lawmakers cannot plan effectively and because our leaders give the sense that they’re in constant panic mode.
As the oft-repeated phrase goes: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results.”
We clearly are there because our results are not moving the needle in a substantive way.
Just take a look at the abysmally low proficiency test scores for  Oklahoma students in reading and math. Just 27% of third graders are classified as proficient or advanced in reading based on national standards. Only 33% hit those grade-level targets in math.
That’s troubling, given the fact that the building blocks for future student success are largely developed in kindergarten through third grade.
Since our leaders can’t seem to come up with a blueprint to set the foundation for legislative policy and funding priorities, I’ll help them.
That plan would ideally include:

A long-term recurring compensation plan for teachers and staff to ensure we’re attracting the most talented educators into our classrooms. Walters showed us with his recruitment signing bonus programs that people will come here if they’re paid well. And, I suspect good teachers will remain if they’re paid competitively. Right now, we rank toward the bottom in the region in terms of pay. And with over $20 an hour average wages offered by private businesses, a starting teacher or staff member can probably make as much or more working full-time at a place like Amazon, which doesn’t have as many politicians meddling in their workday.
Guaranteed money for new textbooks — or electronic learning tools — so schools can plan. 
A huge, recurring investment in tutoring and strategic educational enrichment programs given our children’s lagging learning outcomes.
Planned annual increases in funding to address teachers’ health care benefit costs and to help school districts combat inflation and insurance, all of which are soaring for them just like they are for the rest of us. 
Regular investments in school security. 
An examination of the worthiness of the plethora of school credits lawmakers have haphazardly pushed through over the years. We’re now paying people to send their children to private schools. We offer a tax credit to school donors, and we have a fund aimed at helping property-tax poor districts afford buildings. That last fund is probably a good thing as long as there is a stable, reliable funding source.
And most importantly, it should focus on funding safety net programs, including those operated by other agencies, that help tackle the underlying root issues that may be causing students to struggle: poverty, hunger, homelessness, lack of health care access and mental illness.

It’s been heartbreaking to hear about children who don’t have enough to eat or those that are struggling with unmet emotional needs. Intruder drills have become a reality in our classrooms, but routine investments in security could help harden schools from violence.
Children deal with broken playground equipment or aging technology. And it’s hard to explain to a child that lawmakers are not making proper investments in staff pay so now there’s a shortage of bus drivers, delaying the time it takes them to get home from school.
Enough is enough. 
We’ve managed to develop and implement a visionary plan for our foster care system. We’ve developed a long-term plan for our roadways. 
So why can’t we do the same for our schools? 
In fact, it seems pretty common sense to spend the next 15 or so months bringing together stakeholders from all spectrums of life — parents, educators, lawmakers, nonpartisan education experts, business leaders — and even children.
The roadmap would need to have some flexibility to address policy needs as they develop in our ever-changing world.
Maybe such a plan could be a legacy of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields when they both leave office in January 2027.
Because Oklahomans deserve nothing less than a stable path forward for our schools. They deserve to know that our tax dollars are being used efficiently and in the most effective way possible. And they need the assurance that our leaders did what we expect to put a solid plan in place to get our schools moving in the right direction.

Pantries and emergency food providers across the state are bracing for additional stress and demand as changes to the SNAP public food assistance set in and nudge some recipients out. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — He said he worked 20 years for U.S. troops in his homeland of Afghanistan, in roles ranging from soldier to cook and interpreter, before his at-risk family was flown out of the country in 2021 as it fell again to the Taliban.
Now age 46 with 10 children, the Afghan refugee works full-time in a Nebraska production job and says $2,100 in monthly public grocery assistance has helped his family make ends meet. He and his wife expected to gain financial independence as their kids got educated and into careers.
Mohsen asked that his full identity not be revealed, because he fears retaliation against  family members still in Afghanistan. In the U.S. since 2021, he said he now worries about how the loss of public SNAP grocery aid will hurt his family. He and his wife have 10 kids ranging from a toddler to college-aged. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
But any sense of stability has crumbled, the man said, as his family faces the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law that Trump calls “big” and “beautiful” — and Nebraska’s implementation this week of related changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Mohsen, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation against family in the U.S. and abroad, is among an estimated 7,000 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status who are poised to lose their SNAP benefits, according to Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide organization that advocates for low-income people and immigrants. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services put that number closer to 6,300.
 Vets, homeless, foster care impact

Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines. Also eligible are Cuban and Haitian newcomers and those in the U.S. as part of a compact of free association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. 
Currently about 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for SNAP.

According to Appleseed, another 10,000 or so SNAP recipients in Nebraska — including veterans, homeless and people recently aged out of foster care — are at risk of reduced SNAP benefits under changes and stricter work requirements in the new law. Appleseed estimates are based on 2023 data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Supporters of more stringent restrictions have argued that they will increase accountability, self-sufficiency and help cut government spending. 
While the changes were expected to squeeze out some participants — accommodating a reported $186 billion cut in SNAP spending over the next decade — Nebraska’s release last week of details on how the bill impacts local populations has advocacy agencies scrambling to try and ensure no one goes hungry. 
Based on guidance received recently from the feds, DHHS issued a statement Friday on the changes to be enforced starting Oct. 20, 10 days before the federal deadline for full implementation. 
State officials said they’ve started contacting recipients to alert them, and also have assembled a list of frequently asked questions. Eligibility for each person or family is to be reevaluated when they recertify for the program, which happens every six months, or when household characteristics are updated. So cutoffs won’t all happen at once. Mohsen, for example, recently recertified and faces SNAP loss in April.











There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland.


– Tim Williams, Food Bank for the Heartland



DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell noted that Nebraska is mandated to enforce the changes. Due to the federal shutdown, the state is waiting for additional guidance and said it will provide updates as more information is received. Under the new law — backed by all five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation — states will be subject to financial penalties based on error rates. 
In addition, Nebraska will have to provide an estimated $17 million more in the coming fiscal year to administer the program, said Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s economic justice program manager.
“Monumental” changes, as he called them, have spurred formation of a Nebraska coalition of emergency food providers and refugee advocacy agencies to discuss ways to respond and fill gaps.
 Hit from different directions

Some advocates say it is particularly jarring to know the loss for newcomers, such as Afghans and Ukrainians, who fled war. Refugees and people granted asylum typically left their homelands seeking safety from persecution and violence and have been vetted by the U.S. government to be granted that relief.

In the case of Mohsen, he said he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2021, moved to Nebraska in 2022, and has applied for asylum. He said he previously had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, based on service work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and was rejected. While the government has authorized him to work while his asylum application is pending, he does not have permanent residency or citizenship status, which is now grounds for losing SNAP benefits.
“Twenty years I worked with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. They promised they will help me,” Mohsen said. “We already had the hard life in Afghanistan — why make our life so hard here?”
He said hits are coming from other directions, too. Family members have been denied Medicaid benefits, he said. Bills from a few emergency room visits have piled up and haunt him as he has ignored them to pay others.
His three oldest children were denied federal financial aid to attend Nebraska’s public university system, and the reason given, the dad said, was “illegal” immigration status. 
“We did not come here illegally,” he said. The three ended up enrolling at Metropolitan Community College.
Mohsen, interviewed this week after he finished parent-teacher conferences for his elementary-age kids, said his wife stays at home to care for their children. The youngest, 3 years old and a U.S. citizen, likely still could qualify for SNAP.
The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, responded. He said he negotiated to reduce Nebraska’s cost of implementing SNAP by half. 
“I tried to get the best bill possible, while also increasing funding for our military by $150 billion, modernizing our air traffic control and preventing a 20% tax increase on all families,” he said.
 Pantries scramble

Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity says advocates have been trying to prepare for the changes but still hold out hope the state will create a program to help cover lost food benefits.

DHHS’ Powell said all options would be considered.
But the shifts come as Nebraska lawmakers struggle already with a state government budget shortfall. 
Vlach said it feels particularly “immoral” to pull assistance from a refugee who fought alongside the U.S. She said it hints at something darker.
“When we look back at history, every time a targeted group had food taken away, it marked the beginning of something horrific,” she said.
Toby Rees of Kountze Commons in downtown Omaha said her food pantry already is short of proteins supplied by the Food Bank for the Heartland and has tried to compensate by, for example, using donor funds and grants to buy groceries at a discount from cooperating stores. 
“The need is going to increase,” she said, noting the new faces among about 400 people that visited the pantry Monday. Kountze does not ask for income or other verification, nor does it limit  visits, she said. More immigrant and refugee families are seeking a new and “safe” place to get food, she said. 
“It’s really scaring them,” she added.

Vlach said the coalition is preparing documents in 13 languages that provide information and pictures on available Omaha area pantries and places where people can seek food. 
“Everybody’s resources are limited,” said Rees. “But we are banding together.”
Tim Williams of the Food Bank for the Heartland says his organization provides food to about 500 pantries and other partners in 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa. About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies. 
He called SNAP one of the most useful tools for families to access nutritious food. The food bank is worried about the added burden on pantries at a time of less federal emergency food assistance and greater demand.
“There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland,” said Williams. 
 Work requirements 

Appleseed’s Savaiano fears that expanded work requirements under the new law will create more administrative paperwork that will “gum up” the process and lead to reduced SNAP benefits for populations beyond refugees and immigrants.
Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption. The new law expands work requirements through age 64 (it was age 54 before), and excludes parents with children younger than 14 (it used to be 18). 
DHHS said three groups no longer are exempted from work requirements: veterans, homeless individuals and those aging out of foster care. The state said those exemptions were temporary due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act and now are being removed. A new exception was added for Indians, Urban Indians, and others eligible for Indian Health Services.

Advocates are urging Nebraskans to lean on federal lawmakers to repeal SNAP changes or support alternative programs.
Confounding Mohsen, he said, is why his case seeking a more permanent status has moved so slowly through the immigration court system.
“I worked honestly for those 20 years,” he said of service to the U.S. military. “Sometimes it makes me crazy, it’s upsetting.”
Mohsen hopes to find other avenues to put healthy food on his family’s table, but he is bracing for the last resort. That would be for his older children to quit or delay schooling and help the family financially. He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S. 
“Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said. “If they don’t get education, it’s not meaningful for us.”

In multiple instances, the state GOP’s platform contradicts itself and the stated beliefs of traditional Republicans, writes guest columnist Jim Malcom.
The post The Wyoming Republican Party is a big RINO appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Republican Party platform contradicts what traditional Republicans stand for. I say this as a registered Wyoming Republican voter. 

Opinion

The platform has 23 “timeless truths that will always inform and direct our party and our country…” Meanwhile, unlimited guns threaten life, its anti-abortion fixation drives the government to enforce specific religious interpretations and many of these “timeless” principles emerged in the last century.
The first and highest principle listed, Life (No. 1 in the platform), declares the government’s “only purpose” is protecting individual rights. But then the platform immediately begins a series of demands for government control and violations of those same rights.
Real Republicans believe in limited government, defend individual liberty and respect religious freedom. Yet Wyoming’s GOP thinks it knows better than everyone and forces one narrow interpretation of Christianity. They want you and your doctor to follow their interpretation of their religion.
Many Christians, Jews and others differ on when a fetus becomes its own life. (See Genesis 2:7, Job 33:4, etc.). Ancient religious law treated miscarriage as property damage, not murder (Exodus 21:22). But Wyoming’s GOP encodes a specific Christian view. Their theology “trumps” everyone’s law. Consider: Even 60% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in most cases.
Real Republicans defend property rights. The government can’t touch your land, business or money without due process. But according to the Wyoming GOP, you don’t own your own body. That’s government property now. A rancher’s cattle have more bodily autonomy than Wyoming women under this “Republican” platform.
Here’s the kicker: After claiming their highest value is life, they abandon every policy that helps children survive and thrive — health care, education, childcare, nutrition programs. They chain women to pregnancy and then abandon the children. The contradictions multiply from there.
The second platform principle, Equality, is then violated through many of the rest of the principles. The largest political party in the Equality State, right after declaring equality for all under the law as a principle, goes about carving out special treatment for gun owners, Christians and businesses.
Consider principle No. 3: Second Amendment. First, the GOP platform omits the first half of the actual amendment’s wording, “a well regulated militia,” and then declares there will be no restrictions on arms or ammunition. This undermines their first principle, Life, by exposing schools, churches and public forums to needless gun violence. How can our militia be “well regulated” when driving a car has more restrictions and training requirements than the Wyoming Republicans’ Second Amendment interpretation? No insurance, licensing or background checks required, or even able to be considered.
Equality again is denied in the platform’s sixth plank: Religious Freedom, which gives privilege to Judeo-Christian viewpoints. Thomas Jefferson, who coined the phrase “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence, was also the author of the foundational idea of separation of church and state. The First Amendment says “no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Instead, the platform elevates Christian beliefs and pushes specific versions of those beliefs on women and others. Women may have first gained the right to vote in Wyoming, but the Republican party platform denies them religious equality now.
Another notable example, Right to Work (plank No. 20) effectively discriminates against workers attempting to engage in collective action while ignoring that employers engage in what amounts to collective action through PACs, lobbyists and other means on a regular basis. Their wealth advantage, unbound from living paycheck-to-paycheck, enables them to generate governmental and business pressures on employees that need unions or similar structures to achieve equal consideration.
The history of these so-called “timeless truths” is mind-boggling. Gun control was considered common sense by the NRA and most Americans until the 1970s. Now, school violence is a multibillion dollar industry. 
Then there are the changes over time in the beliefs on unborn children. In 1968, Christianity Today issued the following statement regarding abortion: “Whether the performance of an induced abortion is sinful we are not agreed, but about the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances we are in accord.” It wasn’t until the 1980s that abortion became the wedge issue that it is today.
Right to Work laws originated in the 1940s as a strategy to weaken labor unions and was encoded in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Timeless? Not even close. Michigan repealed right-to-work in 2023, showing that it is not a settled question. Judeo-Christian principles? Christians, including Martin Luther King Jr., have decried right-to-work as “a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.”
Limited government — except when controlling women. Individual liberty — except for medical decisions. Religious freedom — except for other religions. Constitutional government — except when the Constitution is inconvenient.
Ask yourself who benefits from these principles, and who they harm. A platform with these biases removed would be attractive and defendable by all Wyoming Republicans, not just the most extreme activists.

Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state senator is calling out Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services because he believes they have been “totally ineffective” in overseeing local abortion clinics. 
He raised the issue this week during a public hearing of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on several interim studies, including Legislative Resolution 238. That resolution, introduced by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, examined the quality of patient services at Nebraska abortion clinics and the quality of the state’s oversight of the clinics. 
Holdcroft also introduced Legislative Bill 512 earlier this year, which seeks to increase requirements for patients looking to access abortion pills. The bill is pending in the Legislature, waiting on its first round of floor debate. Holdcroft said he intends to focus on the bill during the 2026 session and has no plans to introduce more abortion-related bills next session.

For the hearing and his interim study, Holdcroft did not reach out to either of Nebraska’s two abortion clinics — Planned Parenthood in Omaha and CARE Reproductive Health in Bellevue. He said he “didn’t expect much in return” had he requested information from them.
Instead, his five invited testifiers included representatives from regional and national anti-abortion groups, individuals who filed complaints against abortion clinics with DHHS, a former Planned Parenthood employee and written testimony from Creighton University pharmacy professor Edward DeSimone. Holdcroft mentioned that he also requested a DHHS official testify at the hearing, but he received no response. 
Holdcroft and his testifiers made a range of accusations against both clinics, though Holdcroft later told the Nebraska Examiner that the main focus of his concern is the CARE Reproductive Health clinic because it’s located just outside his district in Bellevue. 
Multiple testifiers, including Holdcroft, shared suspicions that both clinics worked with providers who lacked the proper licensing to work in Nebraska. Several others accused the Planned Parenthood clinic of having a range of hygienic concerns within the facility, including moldy ceilings, old carpeting stained by blood and other fluids, and one instance of a sewage leak that some testifiers claimed leaked into patient areas. 
“There was a gross dereliction of duty by the organization to care for its facilities, patients and employees,” said Mariah Arabalo, a former Planned Parenthood employee who currently works for State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, who has voted in favor of multiple abortion restrictions, including a total ban. 
Meanwhile, Omaha’s Planned Parenthood clinic finished a multi-year $1 million renovation project earlier this year. Erin Wagner, senior director of strategic communications for Planned Parenthood North Central States, said the project has tripled the clinic’s capacity, increasing the number of available exam rooms from four to 12. She said the organization is investing in similar renovations across the country. 
Wagner said during the 2024-25 fiscal year, the Omaha clinic saw roughly 4,000 additional patients compared to the previous year. This was partially due to the clinic seeing a rise in out-of-state clients, particularly from Iowa, which passed a bill in 2024 that banned abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, when an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity. As a result, the number of Iowa patients coming to Nebraska for abortion services rose from 222 in 2023 to 358 in 2024, according to DHHS data.

While Wagner couldn’t speak to every complaint made about conditions at the Omaha clinic, she acknowledged the sewage leak, though she wasn’t sure what specific areas it impacted. She claimed Planned Parenthood officials immediately began working to fix the issue.
“The minute that people were aware it was happening, they were trying to take care of it,” Wagner said. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who sits on the HHS Committee, speculated that Planned Parenthood may go out of business naturally due to staffing issues. A report from The Guardian shared that at least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed this year across seven states, mostly due to financial constraints after they were cut off from federal funding. 
While she worked at Planned Parenthood as a nurse, Arabelo said she witnessed a “gaslighting culture” that superiors imposed on employees. If a worker expressed hesitation about participating in a procedure they didn’t feel adequately trained for, she said they were told their refusal would lessen patients’ access to care. 
Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, said staffing has been a challenge, but said it is no more extreme than staffing shortages affecting other medical clinics. 
Wagner said new abortion bans that have been implemented in multiple states since 2022 have made it harder to recruit workers. Curry Grubb said it’s additionally challenging that as a nonprofit, the group can’t pay employees as much as they could make at a hospital or other medical centers. 
Holdcroft and other testifiers alleged that both the Planned Parenthood clinic and CARE Reproductive Health work with out-of-state medical professionals not licensed in Nebraska. Officials from both clinics denied the allegations. 
Holdcroft argued that such out-of-state providers also violate a Nebraska statute that requires physicians who perform an abortion to be available for at least 48 hours to their respective patients, because often they leave the state after supplying their patients with abortion medication. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you’re sending a woman home with the intention that she’s going to have a miscarriage in her bathroom in the next 48-72 hours … you need to give her a phone number that she can call for help,” Holdcroft said. 
Holdcroft said DHHS officials have claimed the statute doesn’t apply to medication abortions, but Holdcroft argued it applies to all forms of abortion. The statute states that physicians must be available “for a period of at least forty-eight hours for postoperative care,” but the statutory definition of abortion referenced in law is broad and includes abortions via medication. 
Wagner said Planned Parenthood offers all patients receiving a medication abortion a 24-hour phone line they can call with any questions or concerns about their symptoms. It’s also their policy to call all patients a week after their appointment, she said.

Most of the testifiers’ main concerns Thursday were that their complaints to DHHS have gone largely unanswered. Matthew Heffron, senior counsel for the nonprofit law firm Thomas More Society, said he submitted a 21-page complaint to DHHS in 2024 which made 229 allegations against the Bellevue clinic. 
In response, Heffron claimed DHHS officials told him they investigated just one of his allegations, and the case was quickly closed with no penalties given to the clinic. He said he suspects department officials he communicated with did not even read his complaint. 
“This sort of result cannot be the way DHHS oversees health facilities in Nebraska,” Heffron said. “Because if it is, the people of Nebraska cannot trust DHHS.”
Amy Gehrke, chief impact officer for the national nonprofit Center for Client Safety, shared a similar story. She said she filed 12 complaints to DHHS about the Bellevue clinic, and no formal consequences followed. 
Gehrke said her nonprofit investigates potential illegalities at abortion clinics across the U.S., and DHHS has been one of the hardest state agencies to work with. She said responses she received from department officials to her complaints were confusing and sometimes contradictory. 
When asked by committee member State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, Gehrke clarified that the nonprofit does not investigate possible law violations at crisis pregnancy centers, saying “there’s no need for that.”
Fredrickson noted that a large portion of Nebraska’s government leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen, Attorney General Mike Hilgers and DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, are vocally anti-abortion. He questioned why they wouldn’t jump on the opportunity to act on these complaints. 
“This seems like right up (Corsi’s) alley, to be frank,” Fredrickson said. 
In response, both Heffron and Holdcroft said they don’t believe Corsi is responsible for the lack of oversight. Instead, they suspect that lower level employees are controlling these issues. Holdcroft added that investigating clinics falls under DHHS’ purview, not the governor’s or AG’s. 
DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell shared a written statement in response to the hearing’s allegations. 
“DHHS thoroughly investigates each complaint. Per Neb. Rev. Stat. 38-1,106, all complaints and investigations are confidential,” Powell wrote.
If little changes, Holdcroft said he is considering requesting the new Legislative Oversight Committee to investigate DHHS. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, chair of the HHS committee and a member of the oversight committee, said he would take the matter to Corsi and committed to pursuing the issue in the oversight committee if there is no progress. 
After Nebraska made its abortion ban stricter in 2023, banning the procedure after 12 weeks post-gestation, the percentage of medication abortions jumped to 81%, according to DHHS data. Holdcroft said because of this, the department ought to adjust its oversight to account for this shift. 
Although Nebraska’s abortion restrictions are not as extreme as some neighboring states, Curry Grub said the move from a 20-week to a 12-week ban has forced many clients to make decisions faster. Wagner added that it has also prompted Planned Parenthood to increase patient education efforts. 
“We’re not going to shy away and back off on what our goals are for increasing access to health care, even if there’s more barriers being put up,” Wagner said.

(Photo illustration by Winslow Productions/Tetra Images)As the residents of Ketchum will be asked on Election Day to decide which form of government is best for the town, the public is invited to learn more about different types of local government and the role that city councils and mayors play in that governance in Idaho.
On Nov. 4, Ketchum residents will find a measure on their ballot that states:
“Shall the City of Ketchum adopt the council-manager plan of government as set forth in sections 50-801 through 50-812, Idaho Code?”

A “yes” vote would change the City of Ketchum’s form of government to a council-manager plan, where the City Council appoints a city manager as the chief administrative (executive) officer.
A “no” vote would retain the City of Ketchum’s current mayor-council form of government, in which an elected mayor is the chief administrative (executive) officer of the city.

To ensure voters have information about that decision, The Community Library will host a civics-focused event with Stephanie Witt, a professor in the master of Public Administration and Political Science programs at Boise State University. Witt will present a brief history of local governments with a focus on Idaho, discuss the role of councils, and analyze the differences between the “strong mayor” and “city manager” forms of government, according to a press release from the library.

The event is planned for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the library’s John A. and Carole O. Moran Lecture Hall. Registration is recommended to save a seat, and space is limited, the press release said. The event will also be livestreamed, and the link to watch online can be found on the library’s event calendar at www.comlib.org. A recording will be available to watch later on the library’s event archive.
“This is one of the major questions in front of Ketchum voters this fall, and we are eager to help people more objectively understand what these different styles of government are,” said Martha Williams, The Community Library’s director of programs and education, in the release. “Dr. Witt will be an excellent guide in deepening our understanding of these options from a non-partisan perspective. From her decades of research, she’ll also help us examine larger questions about the role of city government in our everyday lives. We hope that people can attend – whether you live in Ketchum or elsewhere – learn, ask questions, and leave better informed to make your own decision at the polls.”
Witt’s research centers on intergovernmental relations and human resource management, and she writes about Idaho, city, and county governments in the West, human resource management, and public administration. She is also the director of training for the School of Public Service at BSU, the former editor of the Social Science Journal, and has served as department chair, associate dean, and the associate vice president for academic affairs at BSU. Her recent and relevant publications have focused on civility in state legislatures, the collision of culture and governance, and governing cities in uncertain times.
Other measures also on the Nov. 4 ballot for Ketchum voters include:

Recreation levy for the Blaine County Recreation District (bcrd.org)
Supplemental budget levy for the Blaine County School District (blaineschools.org)
Ketchum Fire District Commissioners (ketchumfiredistrict.org)

According to Moody’s Oct. 9 update: “Idaho’s Aaa issuer rating reflects its strong credit position supported by continued higher than average economic and demographic growth, healthy and stable finances, and low leverage and fixed costs.”

Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth noted in a press release: “This reaffirmation highlights the strength of Idaho’s economy and the sound financial management that protects our taxpayers. By keeping Idaho’s top-tier rating, we ensure continued confidence in our state’s fiscal stability and investment quality.”
In May of this year, Fitch Ratings also reaffirmed its highest credit rating for Idaho. Fitch said: “Fitch believes the state is well positioned to absorb multiple rounds of recent tax cuts and dedicated spending allocations from the general fund, given Idaho’s prudently managed budget with significant one-time spending that rolls off to create fiscal capacity.”
According to a new report from Pew Charitable Trust, Idaho has approximately 87 days’ worth of spending capacity in its rainy day reserve. This is the eighth best nationally for budget savings. For comparison, Washington state has only 13 days’ worth of savings for spending, which is 49th worst. The national average was 47 days.
Although states across the country are facing a tightening budget outlook, the continued decisive action of policymakers to right-size Idaho’s spending, combined with an $880 million general fund reserve (15%) and $1.3 billion in total reserves (22%), provides the Gem State with ample resources to weather economic changes.

Reporting Highlights

Aggression: Under President Donald Trump’s deportation mission, ICE officers are using force to detain and jail immigrants.
Impunity: The administration gutted guardrails and offices meant to rein in abusive actions.
Disappeared: Some families say they have no idea where their loved ones were jailed after immigration raids.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”
Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

 “Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

 Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
 In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Robert Cerniglia, a Korean American who’s lived in North Carolina for all his life, recalls the late 2016 opening of H Mart in Cary as monumental for members of his community.
It’s where he shops for snacks and other food items that aren’t readily available in other places. It’s the only H Mart in North Carolina, and shoppers flock to it from all over the state.
But in recent years, prices have been going up.
“A lot of the stuff that I normally buy has just increased in price,” Cerniglia said. “This is definitely something we’ve noticed a lot since the pandemic. The pandemic was really the highest price increase that we’ve seen, but it’s not really getting better.”
Representatives for H Mart did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

“Everything has continued to be more expensive,” said Matthew Laurentz, another H Mart shopper. “Inflation has continued to drive things up.”
The current political climate hasn’t helped with that.
Since taking office in January 2025, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many international exports, including those from South Korea.
The country was the sixth-largest U.S. goods trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade in goods totaling $200 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
In July, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods made in South Korea. He later lowered the rate to 15%, including for South Korean cars.
Officials representing the two nations have recently made “meaningful progress” in negotiations over $350 billion of investments in the U.S. that Seoul had earlier pledged in a deal to reduce tariffs, according to Reuters. But in the meantime, consumers are paying the price.
Vehicles and electronics comprise South Korea’s top exports to the U.S. by value. These include vehicle manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, and electronic brands like Samsung and LG.
Prices have increased across the board since implementing more tariffs, but Ira Gabriel, senior group manager for corporate and marketing PR at Hyundai Motor America, stopped short of blaming the tariffs for the higher prices. 
Gabriel said pricing adjustments are influenced by a number of factors, including market dynamics, consumer demand, and upgrades to vehicle features as part of the annual model year changeover. 
“We will continue to respond to shifts in supply and demand with a flexible pricing strategy, targeted incentive programs, and a commitment to adding value for our customers,” Gabriel told NC Newsline in an email.
More than just cars and computers
Over the past few years, Korean cosmetic products — K-beauty for short — have skyrocketed  in popularity among younger Americans. South Korea shipped more skincare and cosmetics to the U.S. than any other country last year, AP News reported.

Korean snacks and media are also attracting more mainstream attention. Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters is returning to theaters for Halloween, and Buldak ramen and other Asian foods have gone viral on TikTok. 
But even as the cultural bond between the U.S. and South Korea grows stronger, their geopolitical relationship has become more strained. 
Tensions between the two countries rose last month when more than 300 South Korean workers were detained after an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Following negotiations, the South Korean government chartered a flight for them to return home. 
The company said in a statement on its website that the safety and well-being of its workers is a top priority. 
“Hyundai works closely with HR and legal teams to ensure compliance with immigration and visa regulations,” Gabriel wrote in an email.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:56:49.386096

Tim Moore (R-N.C.) has served the people of North Carolina’s 14th Congressional District. Many of them are still waiting to meet him.
Over a period where some North Carolina lawmakers have held as many as six town halls, Moore has held zero — so fed-up constituents have hosted two without him.
At gatherings in April and September, residents of Shelby and Kings Mountain came to the microphone to raise their concerns with a life-sized cutout of Moore after the genuine article declined invitations to attend. Hosted by Red Wine and Blue, a suburban women’s political advocacy group, the gatherings drew dissatisfied voters from across the political spectrum.
David Johnson, a Charlotte man who has voted for Republicans for 60 years, introduced himself at the April event as a “reasonable, common sense conservative man” before reading a series of questions written on note cards to the cardboard standee.

“I consider myself to be an Evangelical Christian, and I’m dismayed by your behavior in support of Donald Trump. He is vindictive and cruel and his actions are the antithesis of what Jesus taught and expects of us. Do you condone this behavior?” Johnson said. “Your silence speaks volumes. Please stand up for your constituents and represent all of us.”
Moore declined to comment for this article. In an April statement on X, his office disavowed the first event.
“A ‘town hall’ being promoted in Shelby is not an official event and is not affiliated with Congressman Moore’s office,” the post reads. “In recent months, left-wing groups across the country have staged similar events to create political theater, instead of genuine dialogue. Our office remains committed to serving constituents through direct outreach, regular meetings, and responsive casework.”
The events are part of a trend in North Carolina politics: Republicans have almost entirely ceased holding in-person town halls amid constituent backlash over federal funding cuts, changes to Medicaid and SNAP, and immigration crackdowns. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to stoke opposition to the Trump administration ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Only one Republican, Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), has held an in-person town hall with constituents in 2025, according to public affairs platform LegiStorm, compared to three of the state’s four Democratic members of Congress. And neither of the state’s Republican senators has held an in-person, virtual or telephone town hall since the beginning of the year.

‘Just an opportunity for people to yell’
When Edwards met with constituents in Asheville this March, he faced vitriol from the audience.
Constituents confronted him over Trump’s comments about annexing Canada, cuts to the VA, and the potential elimination of the Department of Education. At times, the congressman was drowned out by boos and jeers.
“Would you give me a chance to answer this question, and then you can start yelling after I answer it?” Edwards said at one point amid the interruptions.
Edwards has not held an in-person town hall since, nor has any other North Carolina Republican. National Republican Congressional Committee chair Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) told his colleagues in March to stop holding in-person town halls entirely.
“In-person town halls are no longer effective because Democrat activists are threatening democracy by disrupting the actual communication at town halls,” Hudson later told reporters.

Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the longest serving member of Congress in the state, has followed that same practice for more than a decade. She last met constituents at an in-person town hall in Statesville in 2010 and has not held a telephone town hall since June 2015, just a week before Trump rode down the golden escalator to kick off his campaign.
She said in a Fox News appearance in March that constituents are welcome to come to her office with questions, but as a rule, she doesn’t “do town halls.”
“It’s just an opportunity for people to yell at their member of Congress,” she said.
Even though North Carolina Republicans on Capitol Hill outnumber their Democratic colleagues 12-4, they have held just four more town halls than the state’s Democrats.
“The Republican Party appears to believe that they have very little to gain and potentially a lot to lose by holding town halls,” said Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University.
All members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation were contacted for comment for this article. Of the Republicans, only Rep. Addison McDowell (R-N.C.), who has held two telephone town halls this year, gave a statement. He said he was pleased to reach more than 100,000 constituents through his events in March and August.
“From truck drivers to parents, folks share their hopes and struggles, especially wanting their kids to have a shot at the American dream of owning a home,” McDowell said. “I welcome hearing from those who disagree, because listening makes me a better representative, and I plan to host more before year’s end.”
Telephone town halls are emerging as the medium of choice for Republicans who still wish to meet with their constituents at large. Others, like Rep. Mark Harris (R-N.C.), have tried virtual town halls through platforms like Zoom.
Lawmakers say these formats allow them to reach a much larger pool of voters, particularly in districts that are largely rural, while critics argue they enable members of Congress to avoid difficult questions and exclude voters who disagree with them.
Cooper said that part of the appeal to members of Congress of telephone and virtual options is to avoid “disastrous” scenes like the Edwards town hall.
“They’re obviously a lot more scripted. I think there is a sense from voters that it’s unclear who gets through and who doesn’t get through,” Cooper said. “You’re not going to have somebody get ganged up on by a bunch of constituents, basically.”
‘I need to hear directly from them’
Where Republicans are shying away from unhappy voters, Democrats are taking every opportunity to renew their attacks on the Trump administration.
“Time and time again, constituents tell me that they are horrified by what Donald Trump is doing in Washington,” Rep. Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) said in a statement. “They want to see leaders standing up in the face of Donald Trump’s attacks and corruption. Their words motivate and encourage me to keep fighting.”
Ross has held more town halls than any other member of Congress in the state, with three in-person and three via telephone. She said it’s important to listen to both those who agree with her and those who do not. “To accurately represent my constituents, I need to hear directly from them,” she said.
Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.) is the only other member of Congress from North Carolina to hold multiple in-person town halls in 2025, with two in addition to her two via telephone. Foushee also held a federal worker listening session in August, which she said was “particularly moving” given the impact job cuts have had on her community.

“Being a Member of Congress is about representing your district as a whole, and without meeting with people from all corners of my district, I would not be able to properly fight for all of our community’s needs in Congress,” Foushee said in a statement. “It isn’t about left or right, it’s about meeting the needs of the American people.”
While Republicans are facing shouts and boos from in-person audiences this year, Democrats in North Carolina haven’t had that experience. Foushee’s town hall crowd in Pittsboro in April asked what steps she and her colleagues are taking to protect health care, defend voting rights, and resist federal cuts, listening intently to her answers.
“I just applaud Valerie Foushee for doing this and giving people a chance to interact with her, and I appreciate her listening and trying to answer those hard questions,” said Pittsboro resident Connie McAdams after the event.
Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) has held one in-person town hall in Charlotte and one via telephone, while Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), representing the state’s only swing seat, is the sole Democrat to not hold an in-person town hall in 2025. He held one via telephone in March.
The flurry of town halls by Democrats in North Carolina matches the national party’s approach. According to LegiStorm, Democrats held more town halls in 2025 than both parties combined in 2024, with 1,184 as of Sept. 22. That’s more than double the 585 town halls hosted by Republicans.
With a total of 1,772 town halls between the parties — about 1,000 of which have taken place in person — 2025 has the most activity since 2021, when Republicans sought to turn the country’s pandemic malaise against President Joe Biden.
Some events are aimed at calling out Republicans who have not met with their constituents. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) held a “People’s Town Hall” in Hudson’s district after his guidance to avoid such events.
Democratic challengers facing long odds in the 2026 midterms have tried the same playbook, hoping to turn their opponents’ absence to their advantage. Chuck Hubbard, a retired journalist challenging Foxx in the Fifth Congressional District, has held in-person town halls in Greensboro, Boone, Lenoir, and Stokes County in 2025.
“My opponent says she won’t hold town halls ’cause she’s afraid of people yelling at her,” Hubbard said in a video on social media. “Well I am gonna hold town halls. I look forward to hearing from you.”
‘What are you afraid of?’
If North Carolina lawmakers are increasingly able to avoid confrontations with voters without electoral ramifications, it is in part because 13 of the state’s 14 congressional seats are noncompetitive. This month, the General Assembly is set to vote on a map eliminating North Carolina’s last swing district.
“They have drawn safe districts where they can easily win, I guess, by having a majority of people that agree with everything that they do, so they don’t have to compete,” said Janice Robinson, North Carolina program director for Red Wine and Blue. “It’s corruption and it’s morally wrong.”
Cooper said politicians may feel no need to hold town halls when they can appeal to voters directly on social media, where confrontations are easier to ignore than in face-to-face interactions. The value in hosting such events comes from showing voters they’re available and listening, he said, as voters need a way to tell their representatives when they’re upset.
“Maybe the puzzle isn’t why are these folks not [holding town halls], but rather, why are others holding them?” Cooper said. “They are going to be reelected almost no matter what happens.”

Robinson said her group organized the constituent-led town halls in Moore’s district so that voters can still have an outlet to voice those frustrations to a lawmaker who has not given them the chance to do so. Her group emailed videos of both events to the Moore’s office, but never heard back.
“How are you going to be able to represent the people in your district if you are not taking time to hear from the people in your district?” she said. “It baffles me that elected officials can just ignore the people that they are supposed to be representing.”
Channeling that desire to be heard, other advocacy groups have held similar gatherings. Local chapters of Indivisible, a national progressive organization aimed at resisting the Trump administration, have held empty chair town halls for Foxx, Rep. David Rouzer (R-N.C.), and Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) to push them to hear from constituents in person.
The state’s senators have also been the subject of these forums. Around 700 gathered in Raleigh in March to protest Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) for ducking town halls, directing their fury at a stuffed chicken standing in for him. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) got the same treatment in Winston-Salem in April.
“I think the American people want to see less destruction and some idea that there’s a plan in the works here,” said Richard Scott, an unaffiliated voter from Fuquay-Varina after the Tillis event. “It’s about time that in North Carolina, we begin to realize there’s a whole lot of people that aren’t in one party or another, and you should be listening to them.”
Robinson said she hopes people across the partisan spectrum push back on lawmakers who refuse to do town halls. As redistricting narrows the winning margin for each member of Congress, she said, it creates an opening for a surge of typical non-voters to make a difference.
“It comes down to, what are you afraid of? Are you afraid of being challenged? Are you afraid of having a question asked that is someone expressing that they disagree with you?” Robinson said. “If you are that thin-skinned, then you should not be in office.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tim-Moore-Town-Hall-e1760737664186-1024x766.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 10:56:49.386096

(Photo by Steve Fala)At the 2025 York Paw Paw Festival, I stopped by the Lancaster Conservancy booth and encountered a retired gentleman who brought up the subject of a local waterway being considered for a large energy project. He favored developing it for power generation over preserving the natural landscape. After some courteous but lively debate, he exclaimed “well, we will just have to ‘agree to disagree,’” and moved on.
Cuffs Run is a small stream running down a steep valley and draining into Lake Clarke on the western side of the Susquehanna River. York Energy Storage (YES) received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in November 2024 to study the area for a pumped storage facility to generate electricity. The project will flood almost 600 acres of the surrounding area creating a large reservoir for producing power.
To understand the potential impacts of this proposal, one can look 10 miles downriver to Constellation Energy’s Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility and adjacent reservoir. This project would be similar in scope and size. 
The Lancaster Conservancy is leading a coalition of partners fighting this project which includes the Susquehanna National Heritage Area, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Farm & Natural Lands Trust of York County, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation along with local Republican politicians. Unfortunately, political involvement in today’s climate is more about assigning blame than finding solutions. A request to reconsider the YES permit submitted by the coalition failed in January when the commission ran out the clock procedurally, automatically denying the request.
The arguments against development assert it would destroy preserved farmland, scenic trails and forests, displacing over 40 residents. According to the conservancy, “the viewshed from the popular multimodal Enola Low Grade Trail in Lancaster County” would be permanently scarred. Which brings us back to the gentleman at the booth and his straight-forward reason for supporting the project, “I need electricity to run my AC.”
That simple explanation encapsulates why the effort to stop this project will fail unless the coalition drastically changes its approach.
There are over 13 million residents in Pennsylvania presumably most who need cooling in the summer months. Is relocating 40 residents that high of a price to pay? Removing farmland, trails, forests and displacing residents in the name of development has been done countless times in the name of progress. What percentage of the 13 million residents know or care about a “viewshed.”
Has the current administration shown any greater inclination to support environmental preservation over business development than previous administrations, especially in a congressional district solidly in its corner?
It’s only a matter of time before this project is approved, permitted, and construction begins. The results will be irreparable with the landscape gouged out and cut up permanently spoiling the countryside just to pump water up to a reservoir during low electricity demand periods (typically at night) and releasing the flow to power the turbines and create electricity during peak periods.
Fortunately, there may still be a path forward but it involves reaching across the aisle to find unnatural allies. In total, the coalition partners have approximately $50 million in annual revenues. In comparison, Constellation Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners, which operate several hydro and nuclear plants along the river, have close to $30 billion in annual revenues with continuing items on the regulatory docket.
On October 2, Constellation Energy and the State of Maryland announced a comprehensive agreement paving the way for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Station license renewal. The agreement includes better water quality and pollution standards and healthier fisheries management.
This endeavor can represent a new paradigm going forward as Brookfield’s Safe Harbor and Holtwood hydroelectric dam licenses expire in 2030 and are beginning their recertification process now.
The Conservancy has estimated in the last 10 years, over $100 million has been invested by governments and nonprofits along the river to support a thriving and growing outdoor recreation and tourism economy. This amount pales in comparison to the expected $1.6 billion investment for a single project by Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor.  These corporations possess the resources to purchase land and obtain permits while having powerful lobbyists and allies in Washington, D.C.
While it may appear on the surface to be “dancing with the devil” to partner with large conglomerates, this is not the case as these energy facilities produce renewable clean energy.
If a broader holistic approach to the region’s energy demand and environmental needs is not embarked upon soon, then an isolated effort to preserve Cuffs Run is doomed to failure. While a “David and Goliath” story makes for a good fairy tale, it rarely happens in real life.
To engage with these corporations, the coalition requires knowledge outside their current capabilities including urban planners, energy grid experts, corporate policy, and renewable energy experts.
Preserving Cuffs Run for future generations while ensuring they have affordable, clean energy are intertwined and reachable goals. Today’s reality requires an alternate approach than previous environmental showdowns. Pursuing this path will benefit us all.

(Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)MEMPHIS — A Tennessee Highway Patrol officer rested his hat on the roof of a white sedan — its front plastic bumper slightly sagging, doors and trunk open — as he searched between the front seats with a flashlight.
The car’s driver, a middle-aged Black man with dreadlocks pulled back into a ponytail, stood between another Highway Patrol officer and a man in an FBI vest near the hood of a THP vehicle and an unmarked pickup truck. The driver crossed his arms and stared at his feet, outfitted in white socks and slides. Two more officers wearing Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) vests walked between the sedan and the flashing blue lights of the THP car.
It was just after dusk on a Tuesday at a Sunoco gas station on Lamar Avenue, a main roadway that runs through several of Memphis’s most poverty-stricken neighborhoods, where the overwhelming majority of residents are minorities, according to the U.S. Census.
Two additional unmarked vehicles pulled into the small gas station and three more officers emerged: one U.S. marshal and two others wearing vests labeled only, “POLICE,” bringing the total to eight law enforcement officers and four vehicles.
At least 45 minutes into what one HSI officer at the scene described to Tennessee Lookout as a “simple traffic stop,” a Highway Patrol officer handed the driver a pink ticket.
The violation: The dangling front bumper.
The driver silently walked around his car, closing the trunk and each of the doors as the eight law enforcement officers slowly withdrew. “Nice talking with you, man,” one officer called over his shoulder as he walked away.
A few minutes later, the driver, who declined to give his name, emerged from his car with a cellphone in his hand.
“That’s the craziest s–t ever,” he said as he lifted the hood and popped the plastic bumper back into place.

Nearly three weeks after the Memphis Safe Task Force was launched at the direction of President Donald Trump with the support of Gov. Bill Lee, officers from multiple federal and state agencies have issued more than 4,600 traffic citations — far outpacing the task force’s 1,044 arrests and 206 firearm seizures reported by the U.S. Marshals Service as of Friday morning.
Local advocacy groups have logged hundreds of reports from community members of multi-agency traffic stops, some posting videos of the interactions to social media.
Trump established the task force through a presidential memo on Sept. 15 to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent.” His memo specifically calls for “strict enforcement” of laws “prohibiting assault, battery, larceny, graffiti and other vandalism, unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations, noise, trespassing, public intoxication, drug possession, sale, vagrancy and use, and traffic violations.”
But federal and state agencies have thus far refused to release details of the citations and arrests — charges, names and circumstances — to the Tennessee Lookout beyond broad categorizations. A Department of Justice  spokesperson cited “operational security” as the reason for the limited information but declined to elaborate on the record. 
The Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to requests for the overall number of traffic stops performed, including those that did not result in citations or arrests. It is also unclear how many of the task force’s arrests resulted from traffic stops.
Lack of data leaves unknowns about impact on ‘violent crime’
Trump, Lee, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and other public officials have celebrated the arrest numbers, crediting the task force with taking hundreds of “career criminals” and “known gang members” off of Memphis streets. But the limited data released by the task force so far does not provide enough information to support these statements, and community advocacy groups contend that the majority of the people being arrested or cited are not violent criminals.
The U.S. Marshals Service’s broad breakdown of the 1,044 arrests includes eight homicides, 48 sex offenses, 110 firearm arrests and 116 arrests involving narcotics charges. Two arrests were due to probation or parole violations, 418 were for “warrants” with no additional explanation provided, 155 were for “other” reasons, and 187 were for Administrative ICE Warrants, which are signed by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials and do not carry the same investigative powers as criminal warrants signed by a judge. 
Among those arrested were 92 “known gang members,” according to the U.S. Marshals Service, though the data released does not include any further information about these individuals’ alleged gang ties. U.S. marshals also reported 56 missing children have been located by the task force, but did not include the circumstances of those cases.
A report to local officials of the task force’s actions on Oct. 13 showed that 37 out of the 51 people arrested that day were not charged with violent offenses, according to reporting from MLK50: Justice Through Journalism. This includes seven arrests for people “unlawfully present in the United States” — a civil offense — with no other criminal charges listed. The document also listed 59 misdemeanor citations.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy reported that his staff had 52% more felony cases and 30% more misdemeanor cases to handle after the task force’s first week, compared with his office’s normal volume. Felony charges can include both violent and nonviolent crimes. Mulroy’s office could not be reached for updated information.
‘Needle in a haystack approach’
Minutes after the stop at the Sunoco station, Tennessee Lookout observed another Highway Patrol vehicle and unmarked pickup truck pulling into a different gas station on Lamar Avenue behind a vehicle with a duct-taped rear window, damaged door and missing front grill.
THP, ATF and FBI officers surrounded the car with a handicap placard hanging from the rearview mirror driven by an elderly Black woman and man. The officers left roughly 15 minutes later. The woman driving the car, who declined to share her name, said the officers told her they pulled her over because the registration tags were not up to date and let her go when they discovered that wasn’t true.

Scarlet Neath, a senior adviser for The Policing Project at the New York University School of Law, said stops like this are examples of “pretextual stops,” or “low-level traffic stops that are made for equipment, administrative (or) other minor violations — like objects hanging from a rearview mirror, a single broken tail light or missing registration sticker — that really have no connection to road safety and which are frequently used as an excuse to look for evidence of an unrelated crime.” 
“Police use them as a pretense for fishing for evidence of activity like possessing drugs,” Neath told Tennessee Lookout.
Memphis barred the use of such stops in 2023, a few months after 29-year-old Tyre Nichols died after police beat him during a traffic stop. But state legislators passed a law in 2024 that blocked local governments from instituting such rules, nullifying the Memphis ordinance.
Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers materials describe pretextual stops for traffic violations as the easiest way to investigate a driver or vehicle for a suspected crime when an officer might not have enough facts for “reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.”
Regardless of an officer’s intent for the stop, the training materials state that pretextual stops don’t violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, so long as they are not “based solely on race or religion.” Pretextual stops must also be “reasonable,” and no longer than necessary to investigate “reasonable suspicion.”
Studies of such stops have called their effectiveness and fairness into question.
A study of the Metro Nashville Police Department’s traffic stop practices conducted by Stanford Computational Policy Lab and the Policing Project in 2018 found that “Black drivers were stopped substantially more than white drivers” and “these disparities were particularly pronounced among stops for non-moving violations, such as broken tail lights and expired registration tags.”
The study also found that these stops “had no discernible effect on serious crime rates, and only infrequently resulted in the recovery of contraband or a custodial arrest.”
Tennessee rep calls Memphis preemption bill worse than “overreach”

“Evidence to date on using random low-level traffic stops to interrupt or detect serious and violent crime shows that it’s a needle in a haystack approach,” Neath said.
Another study examining California traffic stop data from 2019 estimated that the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department made 58,292 stops that year, but “only 487 (less than 1%) were for suspicion of a crime that could be classified as a felony.” Deputies in Riverside County spent about nine out of every 10 hours on the clock on traffic stops initiated by deputies, adding up to an estimated annual cost of more than $258 million.
The cost of running the Memphis Safe Task Force and the amount of time it spends on stops that don’t result in arrests or citations are unclear.
Neath said more data would be needed to examine whether the task force’s traffic stops are effective, including why a stop was made, its outcome (arrest, deportation, seizure, charges brought, etc.), and whether the person who was arrested or faced an immigration consequence had a history of criminal charges.
“All charges are not created equal in terms of public safety, just like all traffic stops are not equally important to road safety,” she said.
Shelby Co. mayor, advocates say traffic stops generate fear
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris expressed concern about potential racial profiling in the task force’s traffic stops during a Tuesday news conference alongside immigration lawyer Colton Bane and community organizer Carlos Ochoa. 
Harris said task force members pulled over one of the county’s employees — a Latino man — and “detained him for a small while, while they investigated his paperwork,” before letting him go without an explanation of why they stopped him.
Bane said he has received “numerous” reports from clients and non-clients of task force officers refusing to return driver’s licenses to Hispanic people after traffic stops. In one instance, a client called Bane during a traffic stop in which Department of Homeland Security and Highway Patrol officers returned the man’s work permit and Social Security card but refused to return his state-issued ID. When Bane arrived and introduced himself as the man’s attorney, a Department of Homeland Security officer retrieved the ID from his pocket, returned it to Bane’s client, and released him.
Bane said the traffic stop was initiated because of his client’s “drive-out” tags — the temporary paper tags that come with vehicles purchased from car dealerships. The client’s temporary tags are valid until Nov. 30, Bane said.
A DOJ spokesperson referred Tennessee Lookout to local law enforcement when asked whether task force members have seized state-issued identification during traffic stops. Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to Tennessee Lookout’s questions.
Ochoa, a member of Vecindarios 901, said members of immigrant communities are afraid to leave their homes, seek medical care, take their children to school or visit local parks.
“The most important thing here is to balance safety and liberty,” Ochoa said. “Everyone is interested in reducing crime. Nobody here is interested in reducing liberty … As a community, we need to balance those two things.”
When asked about community response to the task force, a spokesperson for the United States Marshals Service told Tennessee Lookout, “Though some in Memphis are not supportive of the effort, we have found the overall attitude of the residents, as well as local and state leaders, is positive and they are glad to see the efforts being made are reducing crime and putting the dangerous people behind bars and off the streets.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On Oct. 13, Group Health Cooperative held what appeared to be its largest membership meeting in at least a decade. Scores of GHC patients filed into the Alliant Energy Center’s Exhibition Hall, packing the meeting room until there were no seats left. They voted unanimously to direct their cooperative to change course and voluntarily recognize GHC workers’ chosen union. 
This win was a long time coming for GHC workers like me. We are unionizing for many reasons. Personally, I started working as a family medicine physician at GHC 22 years ago, and was excited about working for a primary care-based, member-owned cooperative that valued clinical staff voices. But GHC has changed. Through my union involvement I’ve come to see that many of my coworkers also face struggles with high turnover and understaffing, unfair pay and discipline and racial inequities. These struggles collectively hurt our ability to provide excellent patient care.
By supporting each other and working together through a union, we can better advocate for ourselves and improve our ability to provide the best patient care. Our input as employees is not only useful, but critical, to making GHC the best it can be.
But since we announced our intention to unionize in December, GHC has waged a relentless union-busting campaign. Following the legal counsel of antiunion law firm Husch Blackwell, administrators have engaged in surveillance and other intimidation tactics, and even used union activity as a factor in discipline. Their actions are under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. GHC has also consistently parroted legal arguments straight from the Trump administration’s attacks on workers’ rights. 
GHC’s most fundamental attack, however, has been on our ability to choose for ourselves what our union looks like. We are creating a union of providers and nursing staff in primary and urgent care and closely related units – basically, the generalists you first see when you get care – since we all share issues in common and would benefit from bargaining together.
But GHC administrators are seeking to forcibly add on workers in specialty care units like optometry and radiology who haven’t even sought collective bargaining. Why? They hope to dilute our Yes votes and make it impossible for us to win a union election. They like to claim that the National Labor Relations Board sides with them, and that these specialty care workers must join with us – but don’t believe it. While the NLRB has said that the employer’s version of our union was feasible, they also said they weren’t offering an opinion on the appropriateness of a primary and urgent care union. GHC is still free to recognize the union we chose. 
GHC has also been confused, or is misleading, about what it is we’re asking for. Speaking with Wisconsin Examiner’s Erik Gunn, GHC representative Marty Anderson said “voluntary recognition” wasn’t likely, because they’d want “an NLRB sanctioned and overseen vote.” But voluntary recognition is an NLRB-sanctioned process: all GHC needs to do is tell the NLRB that they recognize our chosen union, either with or without an NLRB-sanctioned card check or secret-ballot demonstration of majority support. That’s voluntary recognition. It would save everyone further time and expense, not to mention cultivate a positive relationship between both parties going forward. We look forward to a collaborative relationship with GHC as we move forward as a union. 
Attending the meeting on Oct. 13 and seeing the support from our patients and community was truly heartwarming. It reinforced my decision to become active in our union movement – both for ourselves and for the care that we provide to our dedicated patients. Excellent patient care is at the heart of our union movement.
And GHC patients have made it clear, with a unanimous vote, that they stand shoulder to shoulder with their caregivers. As a cooperative where members stand “at the top of the leadership chart,” GHC’s Board should respect membership’s vote by voluntarily recognizing our union, effective immediately. To do anything else is unthinkable in any cooperative that claims to be democratically run.
To show your support, please send an email to the GHC Board telling them to respect the will of the membership and recognize our union: https://act.seiu.org/a/ghc-board-1.

But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of  federal redistricting litigation.,"Absentee voting has begun for several special legislative elections in Mississippi, which have the potential to add more Democratic seats in a state controlled by Republicans. 
​​A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined lawmakers diluted Black voting strength when they redrew districts in 2022.
Seven races are on the ballot for the Nov. 4 general election: six in the Senate and one in the House. But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of the federal litigation. 
SEE THE MISSISSIPPI TODAY 2025 SPECIAL ELECTION GUIDE
The state complied with the federal panel’s order by creating two majority-Black Senate districts with no incumbents in them and by significantly redrawing one House district. 
Senate District 2 contains portions of DeSoto and Tunica counties. Charlie Hoots is the Republican nominee, and Theresa Isom is the Democratic nominee. Neither has been elected to the Legislature before. 
Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, was the incumbent in this district, but he announced over the summer that he would not run in the new district. 
Senate District 45 includes portions of Forrest and Lamar counties. This is a new district without an incumbent. Johnny DuPree is the Democratic nominee, and Anna Rush is the Republican nominee. DuPree is the former mayor of Hattiesburg, and Rush is an attorney in Hattiesburg. 
House District 22 involves portions of Chickasaw, Clay and Monroe counties. Jon Lancaster is the Republican nominee, and Justin Crosby is the Democratic nominee. 
Unlike the two Senate races, Lancaster is an incumbent,  currently in his second term. First elected as a Democrat in 2019, Lancaster switched to the Republican Party in 2021. 
Republican House members are expected to fight to keep Lancaster in office, while national and state Democratic leaders are hoping to flip a GOP seat to a Democratic one in a rural area. 
Seven candidates are also vying for a state Senate seat left open by John Horhn after he became Jackson’s mayor in July. He had represented District 26, which spans across north Jackson into parts of rural Hinds and Madison counties, since 1993.

After President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid in 2020, he and his allies were pushing false narratives about the election being stolen, pressuring state and local officials, and calling for audits of the results.
In Fulton County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold where Trump won a larger percentage of the vote than anywhere else in the state, local leaders wanted to help.
“Sending this email to see what’s going on with this rigged election,” County Commissioner Randy Bunch, a Republican, wrote to state Sen. Judy Ward, also a Republican, in a Nov. 12 email obtained by watchdog group American Oversight. “We can’t let this election get stolen if there is anything I can do please let me know.”
A few weeks later, according to court documents, the county let an outside company examine its voting machines and download data from them. In text messages sent shortly afterwards, one county commissioner said that if the county hadn’t given the company access, a Trump ally would have forced it to do so via a subpoena.
That decision to allow a third party to access sensitive voting equipment set off far-reaching consequences for Fulton County. As a result of a state order, it had to purchase all-new voting equipment. After years of legal proceedings, the county is facing more than $1 million in fines, an amount equal to roughly one-eighth of the county’s yearly budget.
“It sure is a mess,” said Paula Shives, a Democrat who was a county commissioner at the time, but didn’t approve granting access to the voting equipment. “And unfortunately, it looks like the residents of Fulton County will be responsible for the damages.”
Five years later, election officials in predominantly Republican counties around the country are again getting requests to inspect their voting equipment in connection with the 2020 election.
Recently, The Washington Post reported that a Republican consultant reached out to clerks in Colorado to ask if they would allow a third party to review whether their voting machines complied with federal law. The consultant claimed to be cooperating with “officials working on the President’s executive order.”
A representative of the U.S. Department of Justice also recently approached counties in Missouri asking for access to election equipment used during the 2020 election, though the exact purpose of the request was unclear.
In both cases, officials said they declined the requests. But Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, noted that election officials in other states might act differently.
“This is just one more thing that election officials are going to have to grapple with,” he said. “They need support from the states to make clear to them what the rules are and the protocols are for dealing with the request for access to the equipment.”
All of this gives new relevance to the choices officials in Fulton County made five years ago — and the expensive consequences the county is still dealing with today.
Commissioner asks: ‘Who authorized this?’
Fulton County sits along the state’s southern border with Maryland west of Gettysburg. Its roughly 15,000 residents are reliable Republicans who haven’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won the state by a landslide.
Even though Trump romped to victory in Fulton County in 2020, two Republican commissioners there still pushed for an audit in the chaotic period following the election.
Court documents say Bunch and fellow Republican Commissioner Stuart Ulsh allowed a Pennsylvania-based technology company called Wake TSI to “inspect and copy components of” its Dominion Voting election equipment. Wake TSI was also involved in the review of the Maricopa County, Arizona, 2020 election.
Wake TSI was contracted at the time to a nonprofit company run by pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who was challenging election results around the country, according to The Washington Post.
Text messages obtained by American Oversight showed that pressure from a Pennsylvania state senator, Doug Mastriano, may have contributed to the county’s decision to let Wake TSI examine its machines. According to the Post, Mastriano, who is from neighboring Franklin County, told Trump he could arrange an audit in the state, something Trump and his allies had been pushing for.

Shives, who found out after the fact that the examination had gone ahead, expressed consternation in a group text message with the other two commissioners, the records show.
“Who did that,” she asked.
Patti Hess, then the county’s election director, replied with a photo of paperwork from Wake TSI, adding that it was “sent by Senator Mastriano” and that “all counties are to do this.”
“‘All counties are to do this’ by whose order?” Shives asked. “Who authorized this? When was it scheduled? Who was notified and who was present during this process?”
“It was happening this way or in a subpoena,” Ulsh said after some back and forth.
No county appears to have ever received a subpoena in connection with Mastriano’s review.
Why state law restricts access to voting equipment
After commissioners released Wake TSI’s report — which uncovered no fraud — on the county’s website, officials at the Pennsylvania Department of State were alarmed that the county had given a non-governmental outside organization access to its voting equipment. State laws and regulations require such equipment to be kept secure and accessible only to a limited number of government officials and employees of the manufacturer in order to prevent the introduction of any malware.
Attempts to access voting systems occurred elsewhere around the country. In Coffee County, Georgia, Trump attorneys and local election officials allowed an outside company to access voting equipment, which factored into an indictment against Trump and those officials, though that case has since stalled.
In Colorado, Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters received a nine-year prison sentence for allowing an outside individual to access and copy data on voting machines. Peters is appealing her conviction, and Trump has advocated for her release.
Trevor Timmons, a former chief information officer with the Colorado Department of State who now serves as chief technology officer with elections consulting firm The Election Group, said access to voting equipment across the country is generally “severely limited.” Poll workers will have some access, needed to run the machines on Election Day, with election directors and vendors typically having the type of higher-level access needed to program machines.
The logic behind keeping access tight is that if someone has physical access to the machine’s programing, they could potentially reprogram the machine to influence the outcome of elections. For example, he said, in a demonstration at a recent hacking conference, he saw someone add the letters “il” in front of the word “legal” in a ballot question, changing the meaning of a question on marijuana legalization.
In the Mesa County case, Peters “allowed somebody in and they imaged the disk, they got a copy of everything that was sitting on that disk,” he said. “To a sophisticated attacker, it allows them to make it easier to learn how the system works and to customize targeted attacks against that software and against those hardware devices.”
County defies court order
In July 2021 the state decertified Fulton County’s machines, telling county officials that no one could “verify that the impacted components of Fulton County’s leased voting system are safe to use in future elections”
The county sued the state over the decertification, and while that case was playing out, the Department of State secured an order from the state Supreme Court temporarily barring any more third-party access to the equipment.
But there was more to the story.
Fulton County had separately sued Dominion Voting for breach of contract, claiming Dominion “failed to provide a system that was free from defects and compliant.” As part of that lawsuit, county officials allowed another company, Speckin Forensics, to examine the machines — an inspection that occurred after the Supreme Court order went into effect.
The Department of State asked the courts to hold the county in contempt for violating the order. After two years of litigation, a special master appointed by the state Supreme Court ordered the county and its attorney to pay $711,252.21 to the department and $324,672.88 to Dominion Voting.
Ulsh, who lost his 2023 reelection bid, told Votebeat and Spotlight PA that he didn’t want to talk about the decision to allow Wake TSI’s examination and the aftermath, calling it “fake news.”
A bill awaits the county’s taxpayers
The county is nearly out of options to avoid paying the fine. It recently lost an appeal in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its breach-of-contract case against Dominion, but it also is separately appealing to the state Supreme Court its loss in the case the county had brought against the Department of State.
Both the Department of State and Dominion Voting said they hadn’t yet been paid. Last week, Dominion was purchased by a new company, Liberty Vote. A spokesperson for the new company did not return a request for comment.
“I don’t know how the current board of commissioners are going to (pay) that,” said Shives, who lost her reelection bid in 2023.
Bunch, who is still a commissioner, did not respond to a call seeking comment, or an email to him and the other two current commissioners asking how the county would pay the bill if its appeals are unsuccessful.
“I thought they were crazy,” said Stanley Kerlin, a local attorney and Republican who served as solicitor for the county’s board of elections from 1981 to 2019. “They got sold a bill of goods that that machine was no good and it doesn’t count votes correctly.”
He said it was illogical, in his view, that a conspiracy would involve Fulton County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump. And if commissioners had doubts about the performance of the machines, he said, a better move would have been hand-counting a precinct or two.
Now, as a result, he said, the county will have “squandered” hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
Kerlin said the commissioners have said they won’t increase taxes to pay the fine. The other option, taking it out of the county’s savings account, still requires taxpayers to foot the bill.
Kerlin said the audit and the fine don’t get talked about much in the county, which shocks him.
“I think a lot of people don’t understand it,” he said, but added, “they’ll understand when they see the headline that the county has to pay ($700,000) to the state.”

 Kentucky Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert is urging attorneys to step up for what she admits is a stressful and low-paying job but one that is also rewarding: Protecting the interests of vulnerable children as guardians ad litem.
Guardians ad litem are court-appointed attorneys who represent children in dependency, neglect and abuse court cases. Kentucky needs more of them, especially in rural areas, Lambert said.  
Guardians ad litem are well positioned to connect families to resources like counseling and food pantries while fighting for children’s safety, essentially supplementing social workers’ jobs, Lambert said. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts is hosting legal trainings in November to help prepare more attorneys for the role. Registration is required for the trainings, which will be held in Covington, Lexington and Paducah. As of Friday, there were 61 attorneys registered to attend November’s trainings. 
Since this training became mandatory for guardians ad litem in Kentucky in 2020, the Administrative Office of the Courts has trained 1,050 attorneys, an AOC spokeswoman said.  
Each training will include an overview of the federal and state statutes, state case laws that apply to dependency, neglect and abuse cases and information on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), Lambert said. 



The following trainings are scheduled: 
Nov. 7, 2025
Kenton County Justice Center
230 Madison Ave.
Covington, Ky. 41011
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change. 
Nov. 14, 2025
Robert F. Stephens Circuit Courthouse
120 North Limestone
Lexington, Ky. 40507
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change.
 Nov. 21, 2025
Paducah Innovation Hub
500 South 25th Street
Paducah, Ky. 42003
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. CST, subject to change.



Guardians ad litem fight for a child’s best interest — even if it goes against what the child wants at the moment. 
“What makes that role a little bit different is that the attorney filling that role doesn’t have to do what the client wants or doesn’t have to recommend what the client wants,” Lambert explained. “A child who’s abused may actually want to go back home, depending on the circumstances, or not be removed from the home, but if the guardian ad litem attorney doesn’t believe it’s in that child’s best interest, then they are not bound to advocate for that to the family court or the district court who might be hearing the case.” 
As of Friday, there were 8,538 Kentucky children in foster care, Lambert said. Guardians ad litem “play an important role in ensuring that these children receive fair and expeditious attention from the judicial system and are placed in appropriate homes,” AOC said.  
Many times, these cases involve parental substance use disorder or serious mental health issues, Lambert said, adding that there are often more resources for treating substance use disorder than mental health issues. 
“While that number is a heavy number and a big number, it clearly is not all the children in Kentucky who are abused because we can’t do a perfect job,” she said. “Social workers can’t do a perfect job. There are many more children in Kentucky who live in traumatic circumstances, if you will. So, that is just the number of children who, by court order, have been removed from a home for rather significant amounts of neglect or abuse or even dependency.”
Each of these foster care cases is reviewed by Citizen Foster Care Review Board volunteers who make recommendations to judges about children’s placements, and more. Lambert said getting involved in that work is another way for non-attorneys to make a difference in the lives of Kentucky’s children facing the foster care system. 
“I would just encourage Kentuckians to get involved in some way with making their community better for children and their parents,” she said. “And most people do that through community organizations, church organizations, civic organizations, and that involvement can make us all heal a little bit.” 
A financially ‘thankless’ job 
Guardians ad litem have a fairly financially “thankless” job, Lambert said, with a $500 fee cap for cases that sometimes take hundreds of hours of lawyering. 
“It makes it a real passion project,” she said. “I think our guardian ad litems do a wonderful job for the most part, but they are almost in a volunteer situation. Some of these cases can linger for a long time and require long days at court while you’re waiting for that case to be called.” 
Lambert, who once served as a guardian ad litem, said it would fall to the Kentucky legislature to raise the maximum fee. 
“We have advocated for it to be more, because, obviously, that’s not a very large sum,” she said. “Talks go on every year right before session about raising those fees. And we hope that there will be an organized effort this time to raise the fee.” 
The 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.
“I’m very proud of the attorneys who do this work, because I know how thankless it is in terms of the financial piece, but I do believe that most of the attorneys who work in this area do work for for the good outcomes,” Lambert said.
The job also exposes attorneys to second-hand trauma, which can be mentally challenging. 
“There’s certainly secondhand trauma from so much that we deal with today in the court system,” said Lambert. “I know when I worked in the field, both as a judge and an advocate for either children or parents, I think perhaps the best help, if you will, you could give yourself is to problem solve and make this circumstance better for the family or the child.”

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)This article, Part One of the Mercury’s Pulse Check series, was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2025 Impact Fund for Reporting on Health Equity and Health Systems.
In late March of this year the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) was notified that three COVID-19-era grants were being prematurely cancelled. This resulted in a loss of $219 million dollars the state had used to support public health initiatives, the layoff of hundreds of employees around Virginia and the compounding of existing challenges, including a $33 million deficit and burned-out staff. 
VDH is a state agency with several branches of public service, not all of which are as publicly-facing as local health districts were at the height of the pandemic and COVID vaccine rollout in 2020 and 2021. VDH plays many roles in public health; it performs safety inspections of public facilities and long-term care centers, conducts water quality testing, oversees local health districts around the state that operate clinics, and disburses state and federal funding to nonprofit organizations and free clinics. 
For Alexandria’s health district, the sudden cancellation of three federal grants meant 11 people were laid off. 
As he cleared his throat and stared at a note offscreen on a recent Zoom call with The Mercury, district director Dr. David Rose listed out the numerous duties those workers had carried out. 
“I’m just gonna read it because I can’t do it justice,” he said, describing how staff assisted in community immunization clinics, operated IT systems, and connected clients between the VDH district and local community resources. He explained how community health workers conducted public health outreach to various groups in the region as well. 
Alexandria, like much of Northern Virginia, typically has many affluent residents and a sizable portion of federal employees that commute to Washington D.C. for work. But the area is also home to immigrants from many countries like Afghanistan, El Salvador and other South American countries as well as those in East Africa, Rose explained. As such, VDH’s health district there offers information in multiple languages. 
The shock to the system didn’t last too long, he said, as he was able to tap into another federal funding source — the American Rescue Plan Act, a 2021 law that dispensed public health funding to states and localities. Rose said he was able to shift some people’s salaries into ARPA funds and in a Hail Mary, Alexandria’s city council earmarked some funding for the local health district as well. This means that nine of the employees were able to return to work for the time being. 
While Rose’s district has been able to pivot, he emphasized that each local health district around the state has different needs unique to their populations. 
“If you’ve seen one health district, you’ve seen one health district,” Rose said. “You can’t make too many generalizations about what their finances are like, what the politics are like, what the needs are.”
 ‘Billiard balls hitting each other’

Rose likened the grant cancellations and various federal health care changes to “billiard balls hitting each other.” 
This is because he’s also watching for the looming impact of changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid that were outlined in a reconciliation bill that Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed this summer. As thousands of Virginians stand to potentially lose health coverage through Medicaid and hospitals brace for cost increases that may lead to service cuts, staffing issues, or in some cases, closures, patients may rely even more heavily on local health districts, free clinics and nonprofit organizations. 
Additionally, long before state health departments across the country had to grapple with changes in federal funding, Virginia’s already had a grim diagnosis —- staffing issues, low morale and a $33 million dollar deficit in its emergency office, $4 million of which stemmed from fraudulent spending. 
An audit of VDH’s Office of Emergency Medical Services revealed embezzlement by a former department head and lack of accountability among staff. Millions of dollars had gone towards unnecessary spending and the ousted manager has since been convicted. 
Issues upstream meant that trauma centers had received critical funding late and an annual educational symposium for first responders was cancelled last year. A study of VDH at-large conducted by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission in 2024 found high staff turnover and a problematic hiring process alongside low morale, training and procurement issues. 
While the prominent issues plaguing the department came to light last year, they’d been developing for a while. 
“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” JLARC analyst Andrew Dickinson told state lawmakers last year while presenting the audit. 
Beyond staffing, financial mismanagement extended beyond the troubled emergency office. Following repeated procurement issues with the Environmental Protection Agency, VDH had to begin fronting its own cash and seek payback through grants later. 
“In 2022 EPA was not happy with the way that we were handling our grants. So we went under a reimbursement system with them,” VDH Commissioner Karen Shelton told The Mercury in an interview. 
As grim as the findings were, they also pointed to pathways for solutions — a healing process VDH has been undertaking for more than a year. 
 VDH’s treatment plan

JLARC outlined 30 recommendations  for VDH to work on in its report, which revealed the range of issues state lawmakers deemed “disturbing.” 
Some, Shelton emphasized, had been underway prior to the publication of the reports, but some “have definitely been concentrations over the last year.”
In restructuring how VDH operated, officials created a chief financial officer position as well as an office of grants applications. 
The EPA grant was moved out of its reimbursement structure this summer, which Shelton pointed to as a benchmark of success.
The department has also worked to retain existing staff and fill vacancies with urgency. 
“As we looked at coming out of (the pandemic), our agency had a lot of needs with employee burnout,” Shelton said. 
She wanted to look at “employee resiliency and what we can do to kind of replenish and nourish from within.” 
The agency created an employee advisory council and hired a workforce development and engagement director, actions Shelton believes have improved staff morale. 
Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsey said that he began implementing monthly operating reviews in late 2022 to start fostering better communication between staff. Those meetings began to bring to light some of what would later come up in the audits, he said. 
Shelton said that the whole agency has gone through training refreshers over the past winter and spring to “make sure we hold people accountable to do their jobs but also to make sure they have what they need.”
Shelton also credited ARPA funding and allocations from Virginia’s state budget with helping the department update its information technology systems. 
VDH now monitors the emergency office more closely with new accountability measures. For example, an online dashboard that allows municipalities to track funding in real time helps ensure that the rescue squad funding indeed goes towards essential equipment and training that emergency responders need. 
A 2022 change in state law also helped VDH broaden its candidate pool to fill local health district director positions in recent years. Previously, only physicians could helm the districts before state lawmakers allowed people with public health degrees to serve in those roles. Now, with all 35 health director positions hired, Shelton said VDH has had regional health directors report to the commissioner of community health service. 
“Having the regional health directors on board has been a wonderful thing to help with our leadership and accountability and span of control,” Shelton said. 
As VDH continues to rehabilitate itself so that it can continue to serve people around Virginia, Rose said district directors are watching how federal changes affect things locally, from regional economies to health care access needs. 
“One thing impacts another and people don’t always see how they are all connected,” he said.
Rose used another analogy to liken VDH to  part of a cork board of pins and strings that connect the agency with social service departments, religious institutions as well as public and private health care institutions. 
“That really is public health,” he said. “We can’t do it alone.”

Part Two of the Virginia Mercury’s Pulse Check series, on how hospitals and free clinics are shoring up ahead of big federal health care changes and what it means for patients, will be published Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Clean Virginia’s “The Energy Bills are Too Damn High” tour of the state stopped in Richmond Thursday night. It was promoted as a way to allow community members to hear from Democratic elected officials and candidates about how they want to address rising utility bills in coming legislative sessions. It ultimately was a rally for Democrats leading into Election Day. 
“I implore the utility companies, elected officials and regulators to maintain electricity rates that every Virginian, regardless of their finances can afford,” said Hope Elliot, a Richmond community advocate. 
The event kicked off with a discussion between Clean Virginia’s Executive Director Brennan Gilmore and state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, about legislation and regulations that have been proposed in the General Assembly. The senator said one of the most pressing issues facing the legislature is how to manage data center growth which is putting a strain on the energy grid. He pointed to gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger’s stance in the Oct. 9 gubernatorial debate that data centers need to pay a fair amount of the energy infrastructure costs.
“They need to pay their fair share. But it needs to be more than that, it needs to be about energy standards and tying them to energy standards so they’re not using so damn much energy,” VanValkenburg said. “I think we really need to be thinking about if we are going to be a home for them. … We need to figure out how we’re going to make up our energy deficit.”
There have been multiple attempts to implement some kind of statewide oversight into the permitting and impacts of the data center industry – as over a third of the entire world’s data centers reside in the commonwealth. One bill vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, House Bill 1601, would have required certain environmental and sound studies in areas where data center companies were applying for zoning permits. 
The Virginia Clean Economy Act calls for the retirement of carbon energy production methods for utilities by 2045. Democrats have pushed to expand solar and wind production, but faced heavy opposition from Republicans. Conservatives believe that renewable energy sources are not reliable and should not be the priority. Gubernatorial candidate and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earl-Sears said in the debate against Spanberger: “What happens when the sun goes down?”
“Thankfully, battery storage is getting more and more robust by the day,” VanValkenburg told the crowd Thursday night, as if in answer to Earl-Sears. “The governor vetoed a bill on that, which hopefully will pass (next year) and we’ll have more and more battery storage.” 
Also in attendance at the event was state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. She told the Virginia Mercury that while locals can benefit from the tax revenue from data centers, there are statewide implications to the energy use and how it can translate to everyone’s bills going up.
“We need to have some more regulations in place so that we can be more thoughtful in where we site data centers, that we know the actual environmental impact that’s going to happen, that we have full data and appreciation for the impact on our electric consumption,” Hashmi said.
Hashmi sponsored legislation in the 2024 session that focused on energy efficiency programs to help reduce the power being used by utility customers. It failed to pass but VanValkenburg said he plans to bring that bill back in the future.
The speakers denounced the proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center project that is awaiting approval from the State Corporation Commission. The gas peaker plant has been a source of controversy with neighboring communities pushing back against new carbon power. Dominion Energy has said it is a necessary project to meet demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year when the grid is seeing strain.
Proposed Chesterfield gas plant draws community objections, industry support

Republican candidates have frequently echoed the message of an “all of the above” energy profile for Virginia that has been the talking point for Youngkin. They often put more emphasis on small nuclear reactors and gas plants as more reliable sources of energy than solar and wind. They also put the blame of rising costs on the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
“The so-called Virginia Clean Economy Act makes ratepayers foot the bill for energy that doesn’t deliver — solar panels that don’t work at night and wind farms that produce barely 40 percent of what they promise, at best,” said Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, in a statement to the Virginia Mercury in response to questions about the discussions at the event.
Candidates running for the House of Delegates, Kimberly Pope Adams and Leslie Mehta, were invited to briefly speak about key issues in their districts which mostly centered on housing issues and connecting with voters.
Spanberger said in the debate that she supports the buildout of nuclear power as small nuclear reactors are being built in other states and Virginia utilities are asking the SCC to recover funds for future projects.
VanValkenburg said that Democrats in the General Assembly have to be more dedicated to building solar. He said there needs to be votes on allowing more third party companies to have a share in the solar portfolio as well as solar being put on rooftops, landfills, brownfields, and anywhere that is allowed.
“We voted for the Virginia Clean Economy Act, we have to make that real. That means building clean energy,” VanValkenburg said. “So if we want to say we don’t want gas plants, which I think ultimately, should be the goal, we have to build out the clean energy that we want. We have to take the hard votes to do that.” 
There is on-going back and forth around the desire for statewide regulations on solar projects while respecting local authority over siting projects.
“Democrats even tried to strip local governments of their right to decide where massive solar farms can go. That decision belongs to local communities, not Richmond bureaucrats.
The way forward is clear: restore local control, end costly ‘net-zero’ mandates, and put affordability and reliability first,” Taylor said in her statement to the Mercury.
The discussion at the rally also centered on campaign finance reform to not allow utility companies to donate to political campaigns. Some said such donations allow the companies to have unfair sway over legislators.
“We are one of only five states in the country where there are unlimited political contributions from corporations to the folks that represent you all,” Gilmore said in his panel with VanValkenburg. “And this is particularly egregious and acute when it comes to a public utility, a monopoly that you all regulate and are elected to regulate in the general assembly.”
VanValkenburg said he agrees that political campaigns should not be allowed to accept corporate donations from those they are tasked to regulate. Campaign finance reform has been a topic of discussion for years, but little has advanced in the General Assembly.

As rector of George Mason University’s Board of Visitors, he co-authored “Rogue Prosecutors: How Radical Soros Lawyers Are Destroying America’s Communities”— a jeremiad warning that the rule of law collapses when officials disregard their obligations. The irony is unmistakable: Stimson now presides over a rogue Board of Visitors that embodies everything his book condemns.
In his book, Stimson describes how rogue district attorneys adopt a coordinated “playbook”— issuing “remarkably similar ‘Do Not Prosecute’ memoranda” that substitute a partisan template for reasoned judgment. Mason’s rogue Board majority is running its own playbook: circumvent quorum rules, ignore recess requirements, and rush through structural changes under the cover of secrecy.
Stimson’s hastily convened October 15 Executive Committee meeting was his latest rogue maneuver. Back in August, at its last meeting, the Board adjourned — it did not recess. That distinction is decisive under Virginia law. An Executive Committee may act only when the board is in recess or when a special meeting has been called and fails to convene due to lack of quorum. Neither condition was satisfied, yet Stimson convened the committee anyway.  He obviously knows the difference since, at the end of the October 15 meeting, he moved that the Executive Committee recess, not adjourn.
And the agenda was no routine housekeeping. Most disturbingly, the rogue Executive Committee — just five out of sixteen members — approved an affiliation agreement with a separate fundraising foundation for the Antonin Scalia Law School. This unprecedented move fragments oversight and hands disproportionate influence to donors with minimal accountability. Such a consequential matter demands full board deliberation, public transparency and faculty input. Instead, it was jammed through by an improperly constituted, and thus illegitimate, rogue committee.
Excuses not accepted

The parallels to Stimson’s own critique grow sharper still. At one point, his book mocks rogue prosecutors who claim their approach is “backed up by ‘data and science’” despite lacking an empirical foundation. How fitting that Mason’s rogue board now cites self-serving “interpretations” of bylaws and legislative silence to justify actions that violate plain statutory text and basic governance norms.
The pattern of rogue behavior is not confined to bylaws. Just days before the improper Executive Committee meeting, Stimson reposted Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s attack on a political opponent. For a sitting rector of a public university — bound by Mason’s policies of institutional neutrality —  to use his position to amplify partisan attacks was not merely inappropriate. It was yet another example of rogue leadership substituting personal politics for the self-restraint and impartiality required of university governance.
The irony deepens when you consider that one of Stimson’s predecessors as Mason’s rector, Edwin Meese III, now lends his name to Stimson’s own workspace at the Heritage Foundation — the Edwin Meese III Center, where Stimson serves as Deputy Director.  Meese warns in the review of Stimson’s book that “when these officials abdicate their responsibilities and substitute their own ideas for what the law actually provides, the result is …a breakdown of the system … and civic incivility.” Yet under Stimson’s tumultuous leadership, Mason’s rogue board has done precisely that: abdicated the constraints of state law and its own bylaws to substitute tactical convenience for legal obligation.
This is not parliamentary pedantry; it is a breach of fiduciary duty. Trustees of a public university are bound by duties of care, loyalty and obedience to law. Acting ultra vires — beyond legal authority — is not just improper. It is rogue governance, and therefore illegitimate.
In his book, Stimson argued that when prosecutors refuse to enforce the law, communities suffer from lawlessness. The corollary is equally true: when trustees refuse to follow their bylaws and state statutes, the university community suffers from rogue governance without legitimacy. Faculty lose faith. Students see principle subordinated to politics. Donors question stewardship. And Virginia’s taxpayers are left to wonder whether the commonwealth’s largest public university serves the state — or the ideological ambitions of a few well-connected actors.
The dysfunction at Mason reflects a troubling trend across Virginia’s public universities: increasingly partisan board appointments, accelerating board politicization, the sidelining of faculty and student voices, and a concerted effort to subordinate public universities to narrow political agendas. These are precisely the conditions that enable rogue governance. What is at stake is not just one affiliation agreement for one public law school. It is whether a public university will be governed openly, lawfully and with fidelity to its mission — or whether those entrusted with stewardship will place expedience above legality and betray the public trust.
Charles Stimson is right about one thing: When those in power disregard the law, the consequences are grave. The tragedy for Mason is that the rector who wrote the book on rogue actors is presiding over — indeed, has himself created — precisely that: a rogue board. Virginians who care about the integrity of their public universities cannot allow this rogue regime to continue unchecked. The rule of law does not stop at the campus gates.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A superintendent search firm that advised at least one school division in Virginia is now being sued in Iowa for allegedly failing to properly vet an undocumented immigrant before he was hired as the division’s superintendent, creating questions from school board members in the commonwealth. 
Last year, Stafford County School Board hired the same search firm, JG Consulting, which also does business as One-Fourth Consulting LLC, for its search that resulted in the hiring of Daniel Smith, former chief of staff and acting superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools.
The Des Moines School Board in Iowa filed a lawsuit against JG Consulting, claiming the background check missed former Superintendent Ian Roberts’ lack of work authorization and past criminal charges, which has led to questions of if the firm could have missed details during their vetting process for Stafford and other school divisions.
Des Moines Public Schools declined to comment when asked if it has any advice for other school districts after its dealings with the firm. However, in a response to the lawsuit filing, the board chair said the search firm “failed in their duty to properly vet the candidates” and that Roberts should have not been presented to the board.
“JG Consulting’s contract required them to bring all known information of a positive or negative nature to the board, and since that did not happen the board will pursue aggressive legal action in accordance with the law,” Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris said in an Oct. 3 statement. 
Stafford County Public Schools also declined to comment on whether it plans to work again with JG Consulting/One-Fourth Consulting in the future or take any other actions.
In an earlier statement, Maureen Siegmund, Stafford’s school board chair, spoke highly of Smith, saying he is an “exceptional educator and leader who is clearly focused on preparing students for life after high school.”

The national salary average for a school superintendent, supported by tax dollars, is $169,343, according to a recent study conducted by AASA, The School Superintendents Association, informed by 2,077 respondents including 23 from Virginia. Factors like the types of communities school districts serve such as rural, suburban and urban influence superintendent salaries. 
In a statement to the Mercury, Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs, executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association, said selecting a superintendent is one of the most “important responsibilities” a school board undertakes and requires the board to keep in my mind the district’s goals and community values.
“School boards should take time to establish strong selection criteria, engage parents and the community in the process, and thoroughly vet candidates to ensure alignment with the district’s vision for student success,” McCotter-Jacobs said. “Equally important is choosing a search firm that understands the significance of comprehensive background checks and is committed to due diligence at every step. Boards must be able to trust that the firm representing them is conducting a thorough, ethical, and transparent process.”
The Mercury contacted JG Consulting, but did not receive a response.

In addition to having a school board’s approval, a candidate to become a division superintendent in Virginia must have their license approved by the Virginia Board of Education.
Virginia has a set of requirements for candidates to receive a license, but the pathways can vary and have at times come under scrutiny. In some cases, superintendents may already have their state board approved licenses before being hired by a district level school board.
The first three pathways to licensing, “Options 1-3,” are meant for candidates with formal training and experience in education. However, “Option 4,” which is designed for non-educators with significant leadership experience, has been a point of contention. Teaching and administration experience are not required. 
One of the most widely known cases involving a candidate seeking a license under Option 4 involved a former county administrator being considered as a division superintendent in Spotsylvania County. 
In March 2024, the Spotsylvania County School Board hired Mark Taylor as its superintendent. His hiring came as members of the Spotsylvania community expressed concern about his lack of experience in public education and connections to a former board member who was responsible for his hiring. 
Later, the state Board of Education approved Taylor’s license, only reviewing the requirements for him to receive a license, such as having a master’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution, a minimum of three years of successful, full-time experience in a senior leadership position, and a recommendation by a Virginia school board.
But less than two years later, Taylor was fired in March 2024 by the newly-elected school board. 
Taylor and the school division were expected to settle on an agreement by the end of the year, according to a judge’s orders.
 Boards’ approaches to finding candidates

While a small group of school boards have used search firms, others have leaned on the Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) for assistance in finding their next chief executive officer. The association often posts vacancies on its website.
“School boards are equipped locally to decide what direction works best for their division when conducting a superintendent search,” said Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, in a statement to the Mercury. “Each board has access to legal counsel to help navigate and guide them through the process. Candidates often come from across the country, not just Virginia, and the beauty of local control is that each board determines what approach best serves their community.”
As the story of the Iowa case has spread, education leadership groups including the School Board Members Alliance, have jumped in to make sure their Virginia members are protected. Des Moines Public Schools system is now considering a federal system called E-Verify to check a job applicant’s ability to legally work in the U.S., the Iowa Capital Dispatch reports.
In a statement to board members, the alliance told members that one of their most important decisions is hiring a superintendent.
“The choice impacts students, staff, and the community for years to come,” the alliance stated, “but recent events in Pennsylvania and Iowa serve as a serious warning: relying too heavily on search firms without requiring strong safeguards can expose your district to risk, embarrassment, and legal liability.”
The alliance advised boards against accepting “vague assurances” and insisted on obtaining “contract language and procedures” that protect the division and taxpayers.
“School boards often spend tens of thousands of dollars on superintendent search firms to identify candidates they believe will best meet the needs of their divisions,” said Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, in a statement. “Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the local school board to ensure that the individual they hire has been thoroughly vetted.”

(Courtesy photo from the University of Rhode Island)Just how unique is the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?
It’s the question the nation’s preeminent First Amendment attorney is slated to discuss at the University of Rhode Island (URI) next month as part of its upcoming Christiane Amanpour Lecture.
Floyd Abrams will appear at the Kingston campus at 4 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 3, for the event named after the famed CNN host and URI alumna hosted by the university’s Harrington School of Communication and Media. His lecture takes place in the Robert J. Higgins ’67 Welcome Center, 45 Upper College Road.
Abrams has been dubbed by his contemporaries as “the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age,” having argued 13 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
That includes being part of the legal team that defended the New York Times’ decision to publish a number of confidential documents containing information about the cost of the Vietnam War known as the “Pentagon Papers.”
In 2010, he was one of the lead attorneys who persuaded a narrow Supreme Court majority that the First Amendment bars the government from limiting corporate spending on political campaigns — the basis of the controversial Citizens United ruling.
“I can’t think of a better person to speak with our community, especially our journalism students, about how press freedoms are interpreted in court,” Daniel S. Hunt, chair of the Harrington School’s journalism and public relations department, said in a statement. “ “First Amendment cases often set the legal precedent for future interpretations of our constitutional rights.”
Abrams’ lecture will be streamed live on YouTube, Facebook, X, and LinkedIn. Those interested in attending in-person must sign up online.

In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter. (Getty Images)Every year, more road salt seeps off roads into New Hampshire’s waterways, posing a mounting threat to drinking water and wildlife. While the state has voluntary programs in place to try to keep salt at bay, levels continue to rise — and experts said it may take more to solve the problem, whether that means stricter regulations or a cultural adjustment of the public’s winter salt expectations.
“Things are still getting worse. I think it will be a while before we crest,” said Ted Diers, assistant water division director with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
Because the ions that make up road salt don’t evaporate or break down, and plants don’t significantly filter them out of the soil, road salt accumulates in the environment after it is applied. Today, more than 50 water bodies across the state have more chloride — a component of road salt — than is deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, according to NHDES. This threatens aquatic life, because chloride is toxic to fish, Diers said. 
Salt also seeps into aquifers and affects drinking water supplies. According to NHDES, the number of salt-contaminated wells in New Hampshire has risen by 150% over the last 30 years. Salt in drinking water can affect taste and drinkers’ health; by corroding pipes, it can also release dangerous heavy metals like copper and lead into the water supply. 
Removing salt from drinking water is expensive and complicated, Diers said. In extreme cases, seeping road salt can force wells offline. The Merrimack Village District saw this play out in 2023: after documenting a more than 1,000% increase in sodium over 30 years and seeing levels in one of their five wells rise past what the town could afford to treat, the town closed it, increasing demand on their other four to compensate.
The threat of road salt has been apparent to NHDES for some time, said Aubrey Voelker, NHDES salt reduction program coordinator. Before ground was broken on the expansion of the southern portion of Interstate 93 in the early 2000s, routine environmental impact studies revealed high chloride levels in various waterways along the highway corridor, Voelker said.
Calls for a reduction
It became clear from those studies that “a very large reduction (in road salt) was needed,” Voelker said. 
NHDES observed that far more road salt was being used than was required to keep roads and sidewalks safe, she said. When the agency conducted a survey to trace all that salt to its source, they determined that about half of it was applied by contractors that perform winter maintenance at businesses and residential properties. 
In response, NHDES implemented the Voluntary Commercial Salt Applicator Certification Program, or “Green Snow Pro” initiative, which allows commercial applicators to train in safe, efficient salt application, become certified, and receive limited liability protection in return.
Later, the state extended this program to municipalities, another group that contributes significantly to the state’s road salt load.
Voelker said companies responded positively to the program, reporting cost savings and reduced salt usage to NHDES. During the winter of 2023-2024, 177 commercial companies participated, according to a presentation by Diers, Voelker, and NHDES Watershed Assistance Section Supervisor Stephen Landry. 
“Our commercial applicators … one or two years into the program, they come back and say, just by calibrating my equipment better and my crews being trained, we saved up to, like, 40% on our operating budget, because we’re not over-purchasing salt,” Landry said.
Still, salt is on the rise
Despite increasing commercial and municipal participation in the opt-in program, salt levels are continuing to rise in New Hampshire. In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter.
“We’re still seeing a lot of buildings being put up, lots of parking lots,” Voelker said. “… More roadways, more salt.” 
Another factor driving up salt levels across the state, said Voelker, are warming winters. It may be counterintuitive, Diers added, but more salt is needed when freeze-thaw cycles allow water to melt, then re-freeze, on traveled areas. 
“On the coldest winters, we apply the least salt,” he said, because “the point of salt application on roads is not to melt the ice. … It is to keep the ice from adhering to the pavement, so you can scrape it off with a plow.”
Municipalities also face funding constraints and high workforce turnover that challenge their ability to invest in salt-efficient equipment and retain individuals trained in safe salt application, Diers said. 
And this season’s drought has further exacerbated the issue, including, potentially, worsening the effects on wildlife, Diers said. As less water is available in the environment while salt levels remain constant, harmful ions become more concentrated. Data collected by NHDES and volunteers working across the state show concerning chloride levels in many waterways this fall, he said.
“This summer, the data has been alarming, to say the least, due to the drought and the concentrated conditions,” Landry said.
It’s not clear how long it takes for a “slug” of salt to wash through a system, Landry said, but often, the process can take years. This means that even once poor salt protocols — like storing salt outside and uncovered — are corrected, the effects will linger.
Routes to change
Andrea LaMoreaux, president and policy advocate at NHLAKES, said she, like the residents who have reached out to her with concerns about salinity, is concerned about the effect of increasing salt levels on New Hampshire’s waterways. 
LaMoreaux said New Hampshire could take steps to address the issue with more force by imposing stricter rules on salt storage and application in addition to the voluntary program.
“The last thing we want to do in New Hampshire is have to legislate something,” she said. “We’d rather people just hear what the right thing to do is, and then just voluntarily go ahead and do it. But we know that sometimes we do need rules and laws.”
NHLAKES was working with Merrimack Rep. Rosemarie Rung on a proposal for legislation to codify some of the existing “best practices” regarding salt storage, LaMoreaux said. As submitted, the proposal calls for NHDES to adopt outdoor road salt storage requirements and penalties for noncompliance, according to a preliminary version shared by Rung.
Diers declined to comment on the specific proposal, but expressed skepticism about the difficulty of enforcing salt regulations generally, especially regarding restrictions on the application of salt to roadways. 
“Most of the programs around the nation focus on incentives to reduce salt use … or training for municipalities,” he said in an email. “… Enforcement (who and how) is always the challenge with any regulatory approach.”
Diers and Voelker said they felt a culture change would be needed to address over-salting in the Northeast. Within the last few decades, Diers said, excess salt has become normalized in a way that has been difficult to overcome.
“People somehow, all of a sudden within the last couple of decades, expected sidewalks to crunch throughout the winter,” he said.
This might make walkers feel safer, but in fact it signals that far more salt has been applied than is useful, he continued. This is because salt must be dissolved in water to be useful against ice, meaning that chunks of rock salt are not actively preventing icing, according to Diers. But while fighting that expectation may prove an important part of reducing statewide salt levels, it presents a tall task for advocates.
“This doesn’t change by people getting trained or improving technology. It changes because people have a different expectation, and that’s what is really, really hard to get across to people: That you can be safe and use less salt,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salttruck-1024x656.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As the federal shutdown continues, states have been forced to fall back on their own resources to spot disease outbreaks — just as respiratory illness season begins.
The shutdown has halted dashboards and expert analysis from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors indicators such as wastewater to provide early warnings of the spread of COVID-19, influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and other infectious diseases.
The pause leaves states with less early warning on disease outbreaks, potentially endangering lives even as child vaccination rates drop amid increased exemptions and hesitancy fed by misinformation. State and local officials can combat outbreaks with targeted advice to get vaccinated and stay home when sick, but they need to know where to do that first. And residents won’t know to take precautions if they’re unaware when many in their community are falling ill.
Wastewater is particularly crucial to finding outbreaks before people start seeking treatment, said Dr. John T. Brooks, a former chief medical officer for CDC’s Emergency COVID-19 Response who retired last year.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

“This is one more piece of information to each American citizen to inform their decision, like, ‘Do I want to get vaccinated, and is now the time?’” Brooks said. “It really helps protect Americans by identifying communities where you may need to ramp up, raise awareness, remind people about hygiene.”
Ericka McGowan, senior director for emerging infectious disease at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the absence of CDC involvement “could be a problem if there’s some major issue [states] miss.” Generally, states and localities gather their own health information, but many rely on the CDC for analysis and public display.
Washington state’s wastewater surveillance program, for instance, uses the CDC’s dashboards to display information to the public. Now, only state officials can see the information, and they would have to rethink the system if the shutdown continues, McGowan said.
Caitlin Rivers, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies infectious disease outbreaks, checked all 50 states for shutdown-related data issues. In a Substack post, Rivers said the result of the shutdown is “DIY surveillance.”
Georgia had to pause its influenza report, which would normally start this month, because of missing CDC data. However, health officials are working on a version using only state information, said Nancy Nydam, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Health. Some hospitals report cases to the state and some directly to the CDC, so there will be some information gaps during the shutdown, she said.
Shutdown forces Medicare patients off popular telehealth and hospital-at-home programs

In the meantime, Georgia has its own data on emergency room visits showing cases of suspected COVID-19, flu and RSV declining between August and early October.
Georgia also has its own wastewater surveillance program, which provides early warning of diseases spreading in the population before confirmed cases show up in hospitals. But some states rely on CDC wastewater surveillance.
Michael Hoerger, an associate professor at Tulane University, had to pause his state-by-state wastewater reports on COVID-19 because of the lack of CDC wastewater data and an unrelated pause in data from a private wastewater reporting collective called Biobot, he said. Biobot did not respond to a request for comment.
“The pause means that we won’t have a good sense of which states are dealing with elevated transmission [of COVID-19] until the data come back online,” Hoerger said. “I can still post useful national estimates and forecasts, but that doesn’t really help with states that are outliers from what’s happening nationally.”
Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative released a report in August on COVID-19 hot spots in California, and the highest state rates for COVID-19 in late September were in Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada and Utah.











We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data.


– Michael Hoerger, associate professor at Tulane University



For the time being, all Hoerger can do is rely on past forecasts predicting about 499,000 new COVID-19 infections a day as of Oct. 13, the first time it’s been under 500,000 since July.
“We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data,” Hoerger said. “Fortunately, at least nationally, we’re in a relative lull in transmission.”
Like Georgia, many states can monitor wastewater on their own to track COVID-19, flu, RSV and other diseases, according to a list compiled by Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative.
Texas, for example, has not had trouble updating its data during the shutdown, health department spokesperson Chris Van Deusen said. “We do our own surveillance for most metrics,” he said. However, the state no longer gets information on new COVID-19 and RSV deaths from the federal government, he said.
Economists say job losses likely, even as shutdown delays report

North Carolina also gathers its own wastewater data and interprets it with help from the University of North Carolina and local health departments. Normally, the CDC would weigh in with its own guidance and post results on a national dashboard — actions that are paused in the shutdown, said Hannah Jones, a spokesperson for the state health department.
But even if they have their own wastewater data, other state and local health departments may rely on the CDC for analysis and guidance, said McGowan, of the state health officials group.
“Even if you collect the data, you still have to have someone who is an expert to analyze that data to give you some kind of result,” McGowan said. “A lot of localities don’t have that kind of expertise in house and they rely on the CDC for that type of technical expertise and guidance. So there’s a gap there.”
Rivers, the Johns Hopkins associate professor, wrote in her post that she sees “clouds on the horizon” in some states. There are more young children, who are most susceptible to RSV, visiting emergency rooms in Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, she wrote, and also more hospitalizations in Texas.

(Courtesy of CVS Health)New England is facing a worsening shortage of primary care providers, and the trend is accelerating at the exact moment demand is rising. Across the region, aging populations, provider retirements, and workforce burnout are converging to create a serious access problem. States across the region will need to pursue new models of care delivery if they hope to protect community health and prevent deeper strain on hospitals and public health systems.
The scale of the challenge is already measurable. With nearly 26% of Rhode Islanders aged 60 or older and a median age approaching 41, demand for care in the Ocean State is only going up. As a former Rhode Island state representative who worked on health care policy and a senior citizen myself, I am acutely aware of this conundrum. Yet physicians are retiring faster than they can be replaced, and there were recently more than 1,300 open nursing positions in Rhode Island alone. Similar patterns are emerging across New England and the country as a whole, where physician shortages are projected to reach double digits by 2035. 
Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 
One promising model that has taken root in Massachusetts has seen CVS Health’s MinuteClinic partner with Mass General Brigham to expand access to primary care services in underserved areas. Rather than functioning as walk-in clinics alone, these sites are being integrated into a broader care network — allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to deliver routine exams, manage chronic conditions, and coordinate telehealth consults with physicians when needed. 
This approach reduces pressure on hospitals and traditional practices while making preventive care more accessible to patients who would otherwise delay treatment. It is also not without precedent as similar partnerships have already been piloted in nearly a dozen other states across the country.
In Georgia, for example, the Emory Healthcare Network has partnered with MinuteClinic across 35 locations statewide. The collaboration allows shared electronic health records and coordinated referrals, expanding appointment access with same-day and evening hours while preserving continuity of care. Similarly in North Carolina, Novant Health’s affiliation with MinuteClinic integrates medical records, has encouraged better medication adherence, and connects patients back to primary care physicians. These examples – all designed to relieve wait times and prevent unnecessary emergency room use – show that coordinated retail-clinic models can reinforce local health care systems rather than replace them.










Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 


The Massachusetts partnership between CVS and Mass General Brigham could produce similar benefits. By embedding primary care capabilities within a retail footprint, the program increases the number of accessible entry points for preventive services. It also strengthens referral pathways by plugging walk-in care into established hospital and specialty systems. For patients navigating long wait times or disrupted continuity of care due to provider turnover, these hybrid access points can serve as stabilizers rather than stopgaps.  
The primary care crisis will not be solved by expanding residency slots alone or by waiting for medical school graduates to fill decades of vacancies. As such, our leaders should be proactive in seeking out models that meet patients where they are — through partnerships, telemedicine integration, community-based clinics, and retail health collaborations that have shown results elsewhere.
Massachusetts has provided a timely blueprint with the MinuteClinic–MGB collaboration that should be watched closely. For Rhode Island, the lesson is not to replicate it blindly, but to recognize the urgency of adopting solutions that expand capacity without sacrificing quality and if they are successful, emulate them. That means supporting nontraditional care sites and ensuring regulatory decisions do not choke off innovation. 
New England has long been a leader in health care innovation, but it also faces some of the steepest demographic and workforce headwinds in the country. Elected officials throughout the region should make every effort to lower health care costs and increase access. It is their duty to deliver that to their constituents and those that propose legislation that would have an opposite impact should think twice.
If policymakers stay focused on preserving access rather than unintentionally constraining it, Rhode Island can position itself to strengthen its health care infrastructure before workforce shortages become full-blown crises. The alternative — ignoring successful models and jeopardizing existing access points — is a risk the state can no longer afford.

The $1.09 billion number is higher than the estimated $1.05 billion the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission predicted when it came to the scholarship programs. 
“The thing that we’re concerned about is it seems like the EdChoice voucher program is expanding and skyrocketing with the money that’s being poured into that program, and there aren’t nearly as many students in that program to warrant that kind of infusion of money,” Ohio Education Association President Jeff Wensing said. 
The five private school scholarship programs are the Autism Scholarship Program, the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship Program, the Cleveland Scholarship, the Education Choice Scholarship and the Educational Choice Expansion Scholarship Program. 
Students on the autism spectrum are eligible to receive vouchers up to $32,445 for the Autism Scholarship Program. 
Students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) from their district are eligible for the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship. 
The Cleveland Scholarship is for all students living in the boundaries of Cleveland Metropolitan School District. 
Students living in the boundaries of a low-performing school district are eligible for Education Choice scholarships. 
Lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line two years ago through the state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. 
K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion. 
For the EdChoice Expansion, there were 100,930 scholarships awarded averaging to $4,958 per participant, according to the ODEW data. 
There were 42,602 traditional EdChoice scholarships awarded for a total of $283.1 million — with an average of $6,808 per participant. 
There were 1,652,539 students attending Ohio schools during the 2024-25 school year and 1,465,041 of those students attended public schools (88%), according to ODEW data. 
There were 16,691 less Ohio students enrolled in public schools during the 2024-25 school year compared to 2023-24, according to ODEW data. 
Nonpublic Ohio schools had 181,244 students enrolled in fiscal year 2025 — a 4.6% increase compared to fiscal year 2024. 
Aaron Churchill, Ohio’s research director for the pro-voucher Thomas B. Fordham Institute, was not surprised the private school voucher programs surpassed one billion dollars.
“I think it was understood that it would come to that amount,” he said. 
Churchill expects the total private school voucher program dollar amounts to continue to increase the next couple of years before leveling off a bit. 
“I wouldn’t expect (the total private school voucher program dollar amount) to go up as significantly as it has in the past few years,” he said, adding that the goal of the program is to give Ohio parents the ability to choose where to send their kids for school.
Total payments for the five scholarship programs for the past five fiscal years, according to ODEW data: 

$970.7 million in fiscal year 2024 
$610.2 million in fiscal year 2023 
$554.5 million in fiscal year 2022
$444.5 million in fiscal year 2021
$394.2 million in fiscal year 2020

Remaining scholarships
For the Cleveland scholarship, there were 8,345 scholarships awarded for a total of $55.1 million — with an average of $6,835 per participant. 
There were 6,016 autism scholarships awarded for a total of $159.9 million — with an average of $29,110 per participant. 
For the Jon Peterson Scholarship, there were 8,680 scholarships awarded for a total of $103.9 million — with an average of $12,796 per participant.

State officials want to clone Jonah Richard, an Orange County native who’s building housing at a clip in the town where his family has lived for generations.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

FAIRLEE – Not so long ago, Jonah Richard spent his days working for a white-collar consulting firm in New York City. Now, he fills his time bopping between construction sites in the corner of Vermont where he grew up. 
On a crisp fall morning, 34-year-old Richard checked in with his crew. They were putting the finishing touches on six apartments carved out of an old barn behind a general store in Fairlee, which has been in Richard’s family since the 19th century and is now owned by his cousins. To fit a bonus apartment in the basement, Richard’s crew had lifted up the barn where his uncle used to run an antique shop. 
“We jacked it up a little bit and then dug it out underneath, poured new foundation – and created extra living space,” Richard said, showing off the unit’s well-equipped kitchen and heat pump system.
This philosophy – trying to squeeze more housing into any possible nook and cranny in a building, and in a town – guides all of the projects that Richard takes on through his small construction company and development business.
“Everything we do is infill development. There’s no…sprawl and subdivisions,” he said. “Maximizing density is a lot of what we try and do.”
And maximizing density he’s doing. Through his dual enterprises – a small-scale development firm called Village Ventures, and two-year-old general contracting outfit Réal Hazen Construction – Richard’s teams have built nearly 20 homes and are in the planning stages for 45 more in Fairlee alone. The Upper Valley town, a summer tourism hub, has a year-round population of about 1,000 residents.

Richard’s work has grabbed the attention of state leaders who want to see more homebuilding concentrated in Vermont’s small towns and villages, where the odds can be stacked against developers: It often costs more to construct new homes than builders can expect to sell or rent them for, public funding streams that can fill that gap often prove complicated for small outfits to navigate, and a dearth of public infrastructure limits where housing can go.
Pair those issues with the community opposition that so often meets new housing projects, and more risk-averse souls would simply walk away. But Richard has surmounted many of those problems, and state officials are desperate to convince more people to follow his lead.
“We need and want a Jonah in every town,” said Alex Farrell, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Housing and Community Development.
How it started
Richard was raised in nearby Corinth, the son of a luthier and a stained-glass restorer. He eschewed his parents’ artist lifestyle and left home to earn an Ivy League chemical engineering degree. After he pivoted into management consulting in New York, he began to use some of his income to purchase fixer-uppers in Newark, N.J. 
During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when his grandmother was looking to sell a vacant post office-turned-bank building in Fairlee’s village center, Richard saw an opportunity. He bought it for $100,000 and began dreaming up an eight-unit apartment building with retail on the ground floor. Some neighbors balked.
“There was some pushback – some pushback on the appearance of the building, some pushback on the density of the building,” said Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator. But Richard managed to work through those reservations, Brimmer said; his personal roots in town likely helped gain trust with wary neighbors, too. “And holy cow, you know, within less than a year there was a three-story building on the site.”

Richard had minimal building know-how when this first Fairlee project kicked off. He waded through the permitting and financing and construction process, learning everything as he went. He showed up to the jobsite each day, apprenticing under a master carpenter he hired. His own sweat equity helped keep the cost of the project astoundingly low: around $170,000 per unit. State grants and energy-efficiency funds helped finance the project, along with Richard’s own investment and money from extended family. Rents range from about $1,000 to $1,600 for studios to one bedrooms.
Fairlee has loosened its zoning rules in recent years in an attempt to encourage more home construction, Brimmer said, and in 2019, town leaders set an ambitious target to add 100 housing units to the town within a decade. Like many rural towns, it struggled to retain staff because of its lack of housing options. 
Richard had thought he’d finish the apartment project and then “flip that experience” into a development job back in New York. But something about it scratched an itch: He liked reviving the town where he’d spent so many childhood summers, and where he’d since watched shops shutter and home prices rise. Plus the work felt less transactional, more relational. Many of the people Richard worked with on the building he knew from growing up, and have remained his business partners. Together, they’ve put a sizable dent in Fairlee’s overall housing need.

Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator, speaks about Jonah Richard’s housing contributions to the town on Oct. 9, 2025.
“We’re lucky to have him here,” Brimmer said, of Richard. “I don’t think we would get this far along in meeting that goal if it were not for him having come back to town.”
How it’s going 
All along, Richard has sought to teach others what he’s learned. When he began working on that first apartment building in Fairlee, he launched a newsletter, called Brick + Mortar, to document his progress. He’s taken on more and more ambitious developments since the first, like an affordable housing project financed by federal tax credits that’s currently in the planning stages and a 22-unit development with ground floor space for businesses that recently scored town approval.
But he has not shied away from sharing his foibles, either. Richard has catalogued his challenges building out septic systems in Fairlee, which lacks a town sewer. He’s written about the time he got hit with a surprisingly huge tax bill after accepting an affordable housing grant for rehabilitating an apartment building in nearby Bradford – “a cautionary tale” for other would-be small-scale developers, he wrote.
“He’s not thinking of it as competition,” said Farrell, the housing commissioner, of Richard’s ethos. “He’s trying to say – here’s what I’ve learned. Go benefit from my mistakes and my successes. That’s so cool.”
The newsletter isn’t the only way Richard has tried to prompt others to get into the building game. He gave input to state officials as they crafted a textbook for small-scale developers to use across the state, called the Homes for All toolkit. Officials are now gearing up to use that resource for a forthcoming training series, Farrell said.
“We think this could actually be something that has a snowball effect in spinning off more and more developers, more people doing this,” Farrell said.

That’s Richard’s ultimate hope, too. Sometimes he gets calls from people on the opposite side of Vermont asking if he’s interested in taking on a project they’re eyeing. Part of him is flattered, he said.
“But also…you need to develop your own network of developers there that can tackle those projects. And it all comes down to somebody…one, having the time, and two, being willing to take that risk,” Richard said. “The best person to do that is somebody in the community that knows it inside and out.”
There are many easier ways to make money in development than building in this corner of the Upper Valley, Richard said. But for now, that’s where he plans to stay – living on the top floor of that first apartment building he built in Fairlee.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-20 09:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. faces grim reality of fewer international students,Jon Marcus,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/mass-faces-grim-reality-of-fewer-international-students/,"Massachusetts’s schools have recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else because of a demographic decline and the comparatively high cost of higher education here. But even before the second Trump administration, there were signs the bottom was falling out.","It was three months into the second presidential administration of Donald Trump when a small group of New England university administrators convened at a 1902 Beaux-Arts mansion owned by Boston University, just a few blocks from the main campus on an unobtrusive treelined side street in Brookline.
They filed into a high-ceilinged conference room in a one-time steel magnate’s estate turned events center, with huge picture windows overlooking the sleepy residential neighborhood. Representatives of the international student recruiting company that was hosting the meeting strategically positioned themselves at the entrances, handing out agendas.  
The peace and quiet were a stark contrast to the growing chaos in the broader world outside. Billions of dollars of federal research funding for many of the universities where these administrators worked was being cut, and investigations and sanctions were being fired at them by the Trump administration. Soon budgets would be slashed, programs shut down, and employees laid off. This day-long event was about a group that seemed to be facing yet another threat — one with equally grave implications for these schools and the larger Massachusetts economy: international students.
Just days earlier, masked agents had arrested a Tufts University doctoral student on a street in Somerville and whisked her to a detention center in Louisiana. Thousands of student visas were being revoked. International students already admitted to US universities faced a slowdown in appointments for required consular interviews and would soon be required to provide their social media histories. The administration would later try blocking Harvard from enrolling international students at all, limit the proportion other elite schools others could admit, restrict the time these students could stay in the country, and increase the cost of the follow-on visas many have historically used to remain and get jobs here.
A succession of speakers broached these topics at the conference, which was sponsored by the Norwegian international student recruiting company Keystone Education Group. Some triggered nervous laughter, and there were anxious whispers between sessions and over the buffet lunch, from which some attendees had to excuse themselves to take phone calls from colleagues helping international students worried they might also be detained or wouldn’t be allowed to return to the US if they went home for the summer. 
I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world. Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president
The message of the gathering was grim. The seemingly ceaseless flow of international students so critical to Massachusetts universities and colleges would almost certainly slow — probably dramatically.
“You cannot pretend that students from X countries are going to be coming us in Y numbers anymore,” Vera Grek, director of graduate and international enrollment at Wentworth Institute of Technology, told the meeting.
That’s a $4 billion-a-year problem for Massachusetts alone, which ranks fourth among states  — after California, New York, and Texas  —  in the number of international students at its universities and colleges. More than 82,000 international students studied here last year, supporting an estimated 35,849 jobs.
But there was something else the officials in this room knew. The institutions that they represented largely had themselves to blame for becoming so financially dependent on international students. Many schools in Massachusetts recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else, federal data show, increasing their numbers year after year to help fill each successive class. That’s largely because of a demographic decline in the number of domestic students in the Northeast, and the comparatively high cost of higher education here, which makes it less appealing to American applicants from places in the country where the number of 18-year-olds is steady or rising.
While international students comprise less than 5 percent of total enrollment at US universities, they make up 35 percent at Northeastern University, 34 percent at Clark University and Babson College, 31 percent at MIT, 29 percent at Berklee College of Music, 27 percent at Brandeis University, and 26 percent at Harvard. Even onetime commuter schools like the Boston and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts state system have hugely increased their number of international students. International graduate students in particular proved so lucrative that, on one Massachusetts campus — Northeastern — they had come to make up more than two-thirds of graduate enrollment.
Yet as international students became increasingly essential, there were signs that fewer of them were coming, even before the turmoil of Trump’s second term. Global demand for American higher education had already started slipping under pressure from geopolitical tensions, increased competition, and concerns among prospective applicants about cost and safety. Fewer of the international students who were still coming could afford to pay full tuition. While the United States is still where the largest proportion of international students end up, its lead has been eroding, Keystone data show, In the fall before Trump’s reelection, the number of international graduate students and new undergraduates had already started to decline, according to the Institute for International Education, or IIE, threatening Massachusetts colleges’ reliance on them.
“I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world,” says Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president, who was also state commissioner of higher education from 2009 to 2015. “Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.”
That complacency now presents a potential multibillion-dollar hit to the economy, if international student flows further decline, as projections suggest they will. The number of international students arriving in the United States in August, before the start of this semester, was down nearly 20 percent compared to the same period last year, new figures show. International students don’t only help universities balance their books and inject dollars into the local economy by patronizing restaurants, buying cars, and renting off-campus apartments. They also create research that fuels business, fill jobs in knowledge industries, and create their own startups.
“The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot,” says JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an industry group. “People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.”

Massachusetts universities and colleges started doubling down on international student recruitment around 2011, when domestic enrollment began a long decline. Since then, the number of students overall has fallen by more than 14 percent, but the number of international undergraduates at Massachusetts colleges and universities jumped by about 20 percent, an analysis of federal data show. The number in graduate programs, which are big money makers for universities, nearly doubled.
University admissions offices employ designated international recruiters who spend months living out of suitcases as they travel across the globe to entice students. Some team up with schools that teach English to prospective applicants and with companies like Keystone, which works with 5,500 institutions in more than 190 countries. These recruiting agents generate leads from online inquiries and help students pick countries and schools, complete their applications, and find places to live. As an indication of how important international students have become, many universities pay commissions to these agents, according to the National Association of College Admissions Counselors.
However they recruit, there were plenty of signs, even before Trump, that it was becoming harder for US universities to enroll international students — especially those who could afford to pay full American tuition. Instead, the market has shifted away from China and the Middle East to students from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where many need financial aid. This means less revenue than in the past for the US universities they choose.
“The countries where [cost] is not a hurdle are flattening,” Anne Corriveau, BU’s director of international admissions, told the meeting at the mansion.
In 2023, the last year for which the figures are available by country, the number of international students from China fell by four percent after years of increases, the IIE reports. Numbers were also down from other more affluent nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Japan, and flat from Europe, but up from places in the world with less wealth, including Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ghana.
Meanwhile, there has been intensifying competition from other countries — notably Canada, Australia, and the UK, which last year surpassed the United States as a preferred destination, according to a 2024 Keystone survey. Interest in Italy and Spain is also up. Schools in these countries charge less, on average, than colleges in the United States, and generally make it easier for international students to stay and work when they graduate. Far higher proportions of prospective international students also say they feel more welcome and safe in those places than the United States, another Keystone survey of more than 41,000 students worldwide found in April — though two-thirds said their biggest concern about going to college in the US was the cost.
How vulnerable US universities and colleges were to their reliance on international students was laid bare by the pandemic, federal data show; the number fell by 72 percent in calendar year 2020 alone. The greatest decline was in the Northeast, which saw a drop of nearly 20 percent. Even before Trump returned to office, more than 40 percent of student visa applications to the United States last year were denied under the Biden administration, up from 15 percent 10 years ago.
The impact on enrollment of the Trump administration’s visa revocations and research funding cuts will take time to know conclusively. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, which represents international education professionals worldwide, projects based on available State Department data that the number of international students will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent this year nationwide with an estimated $7 billion economic hit. The association’s numbers suggest the Massachusetts economy will lose nearly $620 million — more than any other state except for California and New York. (Other estimates are less dire, an indication of how hard it is to track this, and of mistrust in federal data.) Even before the election, however, the enrollment of international students declined in two key nationwide measures. The number in graduate programs dropped by 2 percent last fall, or more than 10,000 enrollees, according to IIE, after years of increases and in spite of pent-up demand that accumulated during Covid. The number of first-time international undergraduates also fell by 5 percent.
“We often think about year-to-year enrollment, and really that’s not where we can see change. It’s about the slow erosion of what America represents,” says Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College who studies international shifts. “There are actually concerning trends that have been happening for years.”
Massachusetts universities prefer not to talk about this. Northeastern, for example, did not respond to repeated requests to for an interview. Most of the international student administrators at that Brookline conference wouldn’t go on the record. Another school, Gordon College, gave a response that has become typical across higher education. It “decided to pause on providing comment due to the deep sensitivity surrounding international students and ongoing current events,” a spokeswoman wrote.
All of this comes at a time when university enrollment overall is projected to decline further starting next year, as the number of 18-year-old prospective first-year students plummets – a product of the low birth rates coming out of the 2008 Great Recession called the “demographic cliff.” US high school graduates have also started going to college at lower rates, questioning the return on the investment.

A mile and a half from the Wightman Mansion, where university officials huddled to discuss international student enrollment, the smell of Korean barbecue wafted through a neighborhood of boba tea cafes, dumpling dives, ramen shops, and restaurants that sell malatang, a particularly spicy kind of hot pot. Young people balancing book bags and backpacks pedaled on Blue Bikes past storefronts advertising rental apartments. Others fidgeted with their phones while waiting for the 57 bus to Boston University. This bustling enclave in the student-packed Allston neighborhood of Boston is increasingly embracing its identity as a reminder of home for some of the tens of thousands of students who pour into Massachusetts from around the globe to go to college.
Upstairs at Stage Karaoke, a sleek space hung with video screens, LED lights, and lyrics projected in various languages, owner Alex Vichienrat says international students make up most of his business. Private, soundproofed VIP rooms encircle a communal main stage, where karaoke brings cultures together. “This is our melting pot space,” Vichienrat said. Without international students, he added, “this entire neighborhood would be gone.”
These more nuanced contributions of international students are often celebrated by advocates of international education. They’re also easy to see, in places such as Allston.
International students broaden the experience on campuses for everyone, says Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents public college and university faculty and staff.
“This is an increasingly interconnected, global world. We want to train our young people to understand the rest of the world,” Page says. Without international students, “you don’t get exposed to other people and their ideas and it can breed a narrowness of thinking. That would be a real loss, if that kind of thing was to stop.”
The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot.

You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable
Less evident are the long-term economic implications of what could happen here if international students stop coming. 
The preponderance of international students in graduate programs isn’t entirely because of universities trying to meet revenue targets. It’s also because Americans are comparatively less well prepared for science, technology, and other fields. US students score lower than those in 36 other countries in math on the Program for International Student Assessment, a test  that measures how well 15-year-olds can solve real-life challenges using skills they’ve learned. Only one in five college-bound American high school students is equipped to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, or math, the National Science and Technology Council has found.
International students now earn nearly two-thirds of all master’s degrees from US universities in computer science and more than half in engineering. Two-thirds of graduate students in artificial intelligence at American universities are foreign born.
This portends another grim scenario for Massachusetts if the slide continues or accelerates in the number of international student numbers already under way: There will be fewer of them to work in or help start businesses in increasingly competitive industries. More foreign-born than native-born residents in Massachusetts have graduate degrees, and nearly three in 10 workers here in science, technology, engineering, or math come from other countries, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports immigration.

One bright spot — for US universities, if not for students — is that competing destinations have begun to impose their own restrictions. Canada has tightened international student caps. In Australia, the government failed in a proposal to put a limit on international students last year. But it increased visa fees and slowed down processing times. While the UK has a goal of increasing the number of international students, it has restricted most of them from bringing dependents, required them to prove they have enough money to support themselves, and banned them from working until they finish their degrees.
Massachusetts could have an edge with international students who still want to come to the United States but to a place more outwardly accepting of migrants, some experts say. That’s been a concerted approach at BU, for instance, Corriveau said at the April conference in Brookline. “I used to try to sell the US in general, and now I focus more locally,” she said. “I think it’s more important that students understand what it means to be in Boston.” BU even produced a video for prospective international students acknowledging “recent events” but promoting Boston as “remarkably diverse and inclusive.”
Many international students in Massachusetts stuck around for the summer, instead of going home, out of fear they might not be allowed to re-enter the country, university administrators say. Schools including Wentworth helped find them houses and summer jobs, Grek said at the BU meeting. UMass Amherst set up a fund to help them. Bunker Hill Community College canceled summer study abroad programs out of fear that international students wouldn’t be allowed to come back.
Over the longer term, however, the state’s strength in attracting international students makes it more vulnerable than other places in the United States to a continued decline in the number of them, says Chris Slatter, Boston-based managing director at the education consulting firm Huron.
“They rent apartments, they spend in local businesses, they support innovation through research, and in many cases they contribute to the workforce,” Slatter says. “International students are the cornerstone of both institutional strategy and regional economic vitality in Massachusetts.”
If they don’t keep coming, “and, when appropriate stay, and work here, what we’d have is a different economy,” says Tom Dretler, CEO of the Boston-based international student recruitment company Shorelight. “We would be a poorer state.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/intlstudentBU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Ohio Republicans have recently ramped up a push to make cryptocurrency more mainstream, coinciding with specific GOP leaders’ wishes.
Mining for new topics to make policy on, many Ohio politicians think they struck gold.
“We chose to lead instead of follow,” Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague said in an interview.
Numerous bills have been introduced to make crypto more accessible, with lawmakers eventually wanting Ohioans to be able to pay their taxes with it.
These online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and is worth about $108,000 as of Thursday.
Ohio Senate Bill 57 would create a Bitcoin reserve fund, allowing Ohioans to pay taxes and fees in Bitcoin. It would also allow residents to donate Bitcoin to the fund.
Ohio House Bill 116 would ensure that crypto owners can use their digital assets to pay for goods and services, as well as protect the currency from certain taxes.
Ohio House Bill 18 would allow the treasurer to invest in “high-value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
Ohio House Bill 426 puts regulations in place for “abandoned” currency.
Although digital currency bills were introduced in the last general assembly, the two main pieces of legislation were introduced in late 2024.
Sprague has been a leading voice in the crypto push. Just recently, the treasurer allowed state agencies to soon start collecting payments in digital coins.
“The world is moving rapidly toward digital payments, and we don’t want the state of Ohio to be left behind,” Sprague said.
It’s actually a topic that is bringing the top House Republican and Democratic leaders together.
“I think these kinds of risky things, we need to have a long, hard look at… I’m still scratching my head over cryptocurrency,” House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.






Both Huffman and Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, raised red flags. Crypto spikes and falls rapidly, and bitcoin payments can be hard to calculate.






“We have to be very careful with the crypto industry,” Isaacsohn said. “We’ve seen a lot of abuse; Because of a lack of oversight, we’ve seen a lot of people losing their livelihoods.”
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
When I asked the treasurer about possible fraud, Sprague said that the state system would immediately change the currency format once submitted. This is a thorough plan that has taken months to evaluate, he said.
But at one point, the process wasn’t as transparent.
In 2018, WEWS spoke with a Cleveland car salesman named Bernie Moreno — now Ohio’s U.S. senator — who advocated back then for the state to move on this emerging tech.
“By adopting a technology first, and being a leader, you really get an advantage in technology,” Moreno said.
At the time, Moreno became the first person, not only in Ohio, but in the U.S., to pay his taxes with crypto when the state became the first in the country to accept digital currency as payment.
In WEWS’ video of Moreno submitting his payment, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel stood beside him.
Mandel decided in 2018 that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto.
Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
For the years following, policy remained stagnant, and crypto was mainly ignored by the legislative leaders.
“I don’t know that it is a good idea,” Huffman said. “(A crypto bill) is not a priority.”
Both the House leaders continue to say there is more important policy to tackle — property taxes, education and the cost of living.
Asked who is asking for these changes, and if this should be the focus of the treasurer’s office and lawmakers right now, Sprague pointed to economic uncertainty.
“Actually, I think it’s really important because if we do dip into a recession, we want to be one of the states that is the most advanced,” the treasurer responded.
Businesses have been expressing more interest in crypto, he said, so Ohio accepting the coins could help boost the economy.
Timing
The Trump administration continues to push cryptocurrency, as the president’s own coin and his family’s companies have earned $1 billion from the digital asset.
But another high-profile politician is outspoken in his support.
“Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps fill that void, fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” Vivek Ramaswamy said while speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute in March.
Ramaswamy, the GOP-endorsed candidate in the 2026 governor’s race, had long been an advocate for digital currency.
Sprague was asked about his potential as Ramaswamy’s lieutenant governor pick, given his work on the cryptocurrency issue.
“I don’t know about that,” he responded. “But I can say this: I think Vivek is a bold innovator, and he’s looking at the future of the state.”
Strategists believe Sprague is on the shortlist for Ramaswamy’s second in command.
Outside of his official role in government, the treasurer is running for secretary of state. He just announced that he would be the first candidate for a statewide seat to accept crypto.
“We want to be current and we want people to be able to participate in their political campaigns using all the new technology,” Sprague said.
He clarified that the cryptocurrency vendor chosen for state payments is not the same as the one chosen for his campaign.
“Is there any reasoning with crypto being harder to track?” we asked him.
“The way that we’re doing it is we would accept the crypto — we obviously have reporting requirements — we’re actually gonna convert it into United States dollars, and it’ll be put in the campaign and we’ll report everything just like we normally do,” he said.
Sprague said he doesn’t own any digital assets; however, some other politicians pushing for it have confirmed they invest.

Stebbins was arrested in late September on charges of pandering child pornography, according to records at the Franklin County Clerk’s office.
Stebbins, 77, had represented many clients on Ohio’s death row, and supervised more-junior public defenders doing so.
According to a charging document, Stebbins in May transmitted images of a boy engaged in sexual activity. He was arrested in late September and posted bond on Sept. 25. 
His was one of 135 arrests as part of the Operation Next Door crackdown announced by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Others were charged with compelling prostitution, seeking sex with a minor, or being “johns” seeking sex with a prostitute.

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)While I was off last week writing about Kansas journalists of the past, Kansas journalists of the present had a hell of a story drop in their laps.
Kansas Young Republican leaders were caught exchanging racist, homophobic and white supremacist messages through a group chat with others of their ilk throughout the nation. First reported by Politico, the messages included vice chairman William Hendrix using the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and saying he admired an adjoining state’s GOP because “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” Chairman Alex Dwyer used the racist code number “1488,” reacted with a happy face to another Young Republican saying he loved Hitler, and — somewhat perplexingly — wrote that “sex is gay.”
High-profile Kansas Republicans promptly denounced the two men, going out of their way to claim their words didn’t represent the party. Hendrix, who worked in Attorney General Kris Kobach’s office, was fired.
That’s all well and good. But was it enough? Does it actually address the dark clouds of hatred rolling across our state?
If you catch me on a good day, I might say yes. If you catch me on a particularly cranky day, I might say it doesn’t come close. So I wrote two versions of my take, and you can pick the one you prefer. Make sure to read through the end, though, because that’s where we figure out what’s actually happening.
 
The nice version
Kansas Republican leaders have shown that they have more courage and moral fortitude than U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. 
In quickly and unequivocally denouncing the hate-filled messages from Kansas Young Republicans, party leaders have taken a painful but necessary step. A country with two main political parties can not allow one of them to become a haven for racism, misogyny, homophobia and Nazi sympathizers.
For his part, the vice president claimed last week that too much was made of the messages — that “kids do stupid things, especially young boys.” Never mind that the Young Republicans court those ages 18 to 40. His words might sound hypocritical, given that he just demanded mass punishments against those criticizing the late Charlie Kirk, but he was elected vice president, and you weren’t.
Thankfully, Kansas GOP bigwigs took a more honest and searching look. They even deactivated the state’s Young Republicans chapter. All those who spoke out — Kobach, state party chairwoman Danedri Herbert, Senate President Ty Masterson, former Gov. Jeff Colyer and insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt should be praised for understanding the seriousness of the moment and the necessity of acting quickly and decisively.
 
The mean version
Kansas GOP leaders have turned a blind eye to racism, homophobia and violent rhetoric for years.
Statements from prominent Republicans in the state have proclaimed that these shameful text messages don’t represent the party or what it stands for.
But as someone who has followed and covered Kansas politics for the last decade, I can tell you that these messages absolutely reflect a growing tendency within the party — especially the beliefs and rhetoric of younger staffers and activists.
Party leaders could have stepped in at any point to stop this problem. Kobach, Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins could have said that while they might not support legislation protecting LGBTQ+ Kansas children, they believe that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect — including gay and trans folks. Instead, they strip fellow Kansans of life-saving medical care and persecute them through government agencies.
They could have actually forced Rep. Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, to face consequences after clashing with a Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, on the House floor. They could have condemned actions by Reps. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, and Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, after they joked about shooting former Hutchinson Rep. Jason Probst. They could have cautioned Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, that focusing on the hurt feelings of “a little white girl” in learning about racism missed the point. They could have pushed back against transphobic rhetoric from former Rep. Cheryl Helmer, R-Mulvane. They could have condemned racist incidents faced by Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood. The GOP-supermajority House couldn’t even bring itself to oppose racism while passing a bill declaring antisemitism against the public policy of Kansas.
For that matter, party leaders could made it clear that they didn’t want to associate with Kobach after accusations that he employed white nationalists. 
But here we are. We’ve lived through years of willful blindness to shameful bias. Kansas GOP leaders were more than happy to continue paying these folks’ salaries and allowing them to serve in government. Until last week, no one paid much of a penalty for racism, homophobia or violent rhetoric. (At least if that person was a Republican. Democrats who point this out can face dire consequences.)
The only reason bigwigs blinked this time was that a story appeared in a national outlet and included clear proof of these activists’ words. That’s it. Other reporting — like the multiple instances I’ve just mentioned — are dismissed as distractions at best and partisan attacks at worst.
Meanwhile, the Kansas Republican Party has leaned into racist trolling during the government shutdown. In social media posts, they put Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in a sombrero and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard in a Mexican wresting mask. Maybe you find the images funny, maybe you don’t, but I’m not sure how you can square them with Herbert’s claim that “we strive to eliminate racism and we condemn all racist acts and groups.”
Democrats have run people who say terrible things too. The Kansas party has faced its own internal strife. Partisans can lob “whatabouts” until their arms get tired.
But this story is about the Kansas Republican Party and its leaders. Until they clean house and turn their backs on years of winking and nodding at the worst among us, they have no standing to lecture anyone else about morality or good judgment. They have proved that they lack both.
 
The other version
I’m afraid that neither of the preceding versions of this column cover everything. As I thought about the situation more, I came to a conclusion that’s neither nice nor mean.
Kansas Republican leaders have nothing to lose by cutting young idiots loose. The ongoing GOP project in Kansas has one goal, and one goal alone: lowering tax rates for the obscenely wealthy and reducing restrictions on their businesses.
Any other controversy or infighting distracts from those goals.
People like William Hendrix and Alex Dwyer might have seen themselves as important to the state party and its future. Instead, they were pawns being used by entrenched oligarchs to further cement their power in the Sunflower State. The instant that these men became a liability for the state party, they were excommunicated. Masterson went out of his way to “categorically deny any association” with either.
The big-money interests who want to turn Kansas into a zero-tax paradise read the big national newspapers and websites. They don’t want to be embarrassed. A splashy story from Politico threatens their goals in a way that local news stories don’t.
Put succinctly, they can live with racism until it harms their larger project. Then, all those poor suckers who ironically embraced Hitler find themselves on the street.
In Kansas, like a casino, the owner always wins.

For uninsured, low-income, and vulnerable patients in our state who require these treatments to manage their health, federal programs designed to close gaps in access and affordability exist. Yet, many eligible providers in Ohio abuse the country’s largest safety net program.
The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows hospitals serving significant numbers of low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable patients to purchase outpatient drugs at significant discounts from manufacturers.
The goal of the program was to ensure that 340B hospitals reinvest the savings from drug discounts into providing affordable care for those individuals.
However, no such condition in the 340B statute requires participating hospitals to invest these savings in any designated way.
Put simply, 340B savings become 340B hospital profits.
Ohio-based hospital chain said to profiteer from massive charity-care program

Across Ohio, eligible 340B covered entities, hospitals, and clinics authorized to purchase discounted drugs under the federal 340B program reap massive profits without passing savings on to patients.
Providers then turn the equation around and receive higher reimbursements than independent practices like ours, costing Ohio employers, taxpayers, and patients millions more in health care costs.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee found that, from April 2020 to June 2023, Cleveland Clinic generated nearly $1 billion in 340B profits while contributing less than 2% of their revenue towards charity care.
This widespread misuse of the 340B program has resulted in patients being left behind.
Instead of using its savings to expand access for the low-income and uninsured, many hospitals limit in-house infusion services to full paying, privately insured patients, whom the program was not designed for — redirecting those needing financial assistance to clinics like ours, which do not receive 340B discounts and operate with fewer resources.
Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic faces questions over booming subsidies

Despite receiving steep discounts, Ohio 340B hospitals provide less of their operating expenses towards charity care than the national average.
In addition to failing vulnerable patients, misuse of 340B has allowed large health systems to expand their market power.
Today, 340B pads Ohio’s largest health systems’ bottom lines, squeezing out smaller practices and limiting patient options for care.

Despite ongoing calls for federal action aimed at improving transparency and accountability in the federal 340B program, Ohio lawmakers introduced legislation that would enable hospitals to continue exploiting this safety-net program at the expense of patients.
For example, at the Ohio Statehouse, HB 588 and SB 269 would allow covered entities, contract pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to continue generating unchecked 340B profits through a program with little oversight and transparency guardrails.
Our state lawmakers have a responsibility to protect Ohio’s most vulnerable patients, and advancing these bills does exactly the opposite.
The data paints a clear picture: 340B fails to serve Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.
Helping patients access and afford their treatments is part of my passion and why I do what I do, but 340B hospitals need to do their part.
The lack of effective guardrails enables large health systems to exploit the 340B program as a cash cow rather than a safety net, squeezing out independent providers like me and raising patient costs.
Policymakers should fight for regulations that restore the program to its original intent — protecting Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.

(Photo by Elaine S. Povich, Stateline)After years of declining test scores, the Maine Department of Education is introducing a plan to bolster math and literacy skills statewide.
The department is taking a more hands-on approach than it has before, from helping districts identify evidence-based teaching materials and offering professional development for teachers to including families in learning plans. 
While it can’t mandate that districts use the plans developed by expert advisory councils to promote better instruction, teachers and schools across Maine have been looking for guidance, and would benefit from the support the department is now offering, according to several education experts that spoke with Maine Morning Star. 
Maine students in 2024 had the lowest test scores in three decades in both reading and math, according to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP, pronounced nape), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Although national assessments only offer a snapshot into student achievement, some members of the Maine Legislature and several education experts expressed concerns about the consistent decline in learning outcomes. 
While the department said the work to strengthen math and reading instruction was already underway, the poor test results underscored the importance and timeliness of offering districts additional support, according to Beth Lambert, the department’s chief teaching and learning officer.
“The national assessment results definitely reinforced what we already knew: too many students are struggling with these core skills,” Lambert said. 
The department is hoping this effort will provide more sustained support that will turn the tide, she said, versus a quick response that “fizzles out.” 
Over the past few months, the department formed councils led by school leaders and curriculum experts from across the state to develop plans to improve literacy and numeracy. The plans, which are now public, outline what the department will prioritize. The literacy plan is focused on using learning materials proven to help students read better, while the math plan aims to incorporate the subject more ubiquitously and remove some of the common student fears associated with it. Both plans focus heavily on teacher training and ongoing support. 
The department will start by internally training staff to be coaches sent to districts for curriculum support and professional development, Lambert said. The feedback has already been positive, with many districts asking for resources like these to help them develop better methods to teach literacy and math, she said. 
Maine students score lowest in three decades on nation’s report card

“I feel very hopeful and reassured by the department’s announcement,” said Janet Fairman, a University of Maine professor and co-director of the Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI,) which conducts legislative research. “That is exactly what’s needed, and I think educators in schools will welcome it.”
Both plans also address some gaps in support that educational experts and district leaders have pointed to as potential reasons for consistently falling scores. Some reasons students weren’t doing as well included the likely failure of schools to use evidence-based literacy and math programs; changing state-level assessments, which resulted in an unclear picture of academic performance over a period of time; and Maine’s strong prioritization of local control, which means the state doesn’t intervene enough, leaving it up to districts to figure out their own academic recovery strategies. 
Evidence-based literacy
A 2023 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report found that the literacy programs used by schools vary widely, and aren’t always evidence-based.
The two most common reading programs Maine teachers were relying on in elementary grades did not meet quality standards, according to EdReports, a national nonprofit that studies and reviews instructional materials that was cited in the report.
Only 20% of administrators who responded to the research institute’s survey were using programs that met the EdReports quality requirements, which are based on the widely accepted Common Core standards.
Fairman, one of the report authors, said that’s because some districts did not have any specified reading curricula, and teachers aren’t sure what to use so they go online, ask their colleagues for ideas and materials, and rarely find resources that align with what’s been proven best for literacy. That’s one of the big reasons why reading scores have not been improving, particularly since the pandemic, Fairman said.
Now, the department plans to align all literacy plans with the science of reading, a vast body of research into what works when teaching students to read. The literacy plan also includes ensuring teacher preparation programs align their reading courses with evidence-based practices and make sure incoming teacher candidates complete a dedicated reading methods course.
The teacher training aspect is critical to improving reading outcomes, according to Sara Flanagan, an associate professor within the University of Southern Maine’s College of Education and Human Development.
Flanagan said professional development is “a critical part of the literacy plan so that teachers receive guidance and feedback on their instruction, and access to training to help implement and evaluate instruction in a way that aligns to evidence-based practices.” 
Research has shown that when teachers have the preparation and support they need to deliver effective reading instruction, their students are more likely to also have positive gains in reading, Flanagan said.
Incorporating math into all instruction
Renita Ward-Downer, director of instruction at the Brewer School Department and a member of the math advisory council, said the new numeracy plan she helped design is focused on building children’s confidence in math at an early age, integrating numeracy into everyday life, and addressing the negative attitudes towards math.
“Our big push is to really think about how we can get it out there that everybody has to do math every day,” she said.“Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.”
That will start by introducing math into other subjects, particularly at the elementary level, and training elementary school teachers accordingly, Ward-Downer said. The Brewer School Department is already partnering with the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education (called the Rise Center) within the University of Maine to train teachers to adopt that approach this year, she said. She noted that professional development in math is not as widespread as it is for literacy.










Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.


– Renita Ward-Downer, Brewer School Department


The plan is also focused on demonstrating to students how math can be used in the real world, which will include close partnerships with the career and technical education centers.
“For example, you’re pulling in that construction person and talking about how they’re using math every day to build a house or build a deck,” Ward-Downer said.
At the end of this year, Brewer schools will survey teachers, students and families about their relationship with math to gauge whether they see themselves as problem solvers or mathematical thinkers as a result of the more integrated curriculum, and use the results to adjust instruction and professional development accordingly, she said.
Legislative support
Earlier this year, during a meeting of the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,, Republicans and Democrats expressed their disappointment in the national test scores and told Maine Department of Education representatives that their response was “not sufficient.”
“I’m very, very unhappy,” Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York) said during the meeting.
Three members of the committee told the Maine Morning Star hey’re encouraged by the department’s new initiatives.
“Student success depends on so many factors, including family life outside of the classroom, and improving student performance requires a comprehensive approach,” said committee co-chair Rep. Kelly Murphy (D-Scarborough).
“Focusing on evidence-based practices in reading and math and providing teachers with better access to high-quality instructional resources will have a positive impact on students throughout Maine.”
Pointing to the $10 million in literacy grants the DOE awarded to districts last year, Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland) said the reading and math plans are “the next step,” but added that there still needs to be accountability to ensure that the curricular support and teacher training is working.
“What I’m going to be looking for and talking DOE about is some further ways that we can measure outcomes and see if some of the training that we’re doing is effective with teachers,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to be able to monitor pretty closely how well students are doing and increase proficiency in both math and reading.”
The national test scores aren’t the best way to measure proficiency, Brennan pointed out, but since Maine has changed its state assessment system frequently over the last decade, it is not yet clear how the state will determine how successful these initiatives are.
Republican Rep. Barbara Bagshaw from Windham partly credited the Trump administration’s focus on “traditional academic learning” and Maine’s compliance with federal executive orders for the learning plans.
“For years, Republicans have been calling on the DOE and the Mills administration to focus on the basics in order to boost student achievement, so this represents a positive step in that direction,” she said. “I can’t help but think that federal support for children’s wellbeing is helping bring this about.”
Brennan disagreed, saying this is the culmination of work the department and the Legislature started five years ago.
While the department is using “back to basics” to describe the initiative, which is a phrase used nationwide by some Republican leaders to signal a shift from social emotional learning to more traditional education, both Brennan and the department emphasized that the label refers to a renewed focus on core learning principles, not a move away from the additional supports schools have added for students over the recent years.
“When we talk about ‘back to basics,’ we’re really talking about going back to what research shows us works, which is explicit and systematic instruction and reading and math,” Lambert said.
“It’s not a shifting of resources or moving of priorities.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)I spent some time Saturday among a couple thousand or so who gathered at the Nebraska State Capitol for the No Kings rally. 
As a journalist, a big part of being at Lincoln’s version of No Kings (one of 15 across Nebraska) — as it is with any similarly-situated event — was to see the numbers, measure the vibe and determine what, if anything, was new or newsy. 
To wit: While the enterprise was peaceful, people did express their considerable displeasure and growing frustration with the country’s current leadership. Call it good trouble with a joyful noise of cheers, chants and a chorus of supportive car horns along Capitol Parkway.
Much of that sentiment was displayed on hundreds of fierce, funny signs, some pointed — and a few profane — but each adding to an undercurrent of commitment that permeated the proceedings. Prominent, too, as was the case in June’s No Kings event, as was the presence of the American flag. Just saying.
While I was there to exercise my rights associated with the press — a Constitutional guarantee under siege in some cities — I also happily exercised my right to be part of a peaceable assembly attempting to petition the government to stop with all its illiberal nonsense. 
One could also argue the signs and voices of thousands fell within the confines of their speech rights, which meant had I fallen to my knees in an unencumbered prayer of my choosing, or intentionally refrained from doing so, I could have made a clean sweep of exercising the First Amendment’s quintet of liberties.
I mention those democratic principles on which we conduct (or are at least supposed to conduct) civic and political discourse, because before the rally, some of official Washington sounded as though the nation was about to be overrun by conquering hordes of subversives, desperadoes bent on destroying all we hold dear. 
Normally, one might attribute such hyperbole (the details of which you’ll find in the next two paragraphs) to political puffery, simple blather or plain gasbaggery. But, as you’ve noticed, we no longer live in normal times.
For the record: I neither hate my country nor support Hamas, ideas trafficked by some Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who went as far as to declare our Lincoln assembly a “terrorist” event. 
While I read no specific comment from Nebraska’s congressional delegation on No Kings events, there is unfortunately more: I am not a Marxist, the appellation I might have trouble defining in terms relevant to modern politics but one Johnson used to describe the millions in the streets on Saturday. I am, however, an unrepentant fan of the Constitution and its principles. 
Oh, and that whole antifa boogeyman shtick, the one Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy used to insist No Kings participants were members? Turns out antifa, as in anti-fascism, is an idea, not an organization of which people can become a member like the YMCA or Young Republicans. Go figure.
Finally, in response to one more charge of those trying to diminish the impact of a gathering of millions of Americans to express their unhappiness with the current administration, no one, including oft-cited bogeyman George Soros, paid me, offered to pay me or even handed me a coupon for a free sub sandwich or discounted car wash for my attendance.
That about covers everything from the let’s-just-make-it-up-and-see-what-happens crowd. To the obvious chagrin of many, the No Kings assemblage was also a diverse lot, a constituency of colors, genders, ages and abilities. The group’s individuals were clearly equal in their rally status, too. 
They were eager to include and encourage friends and strangers alike. All of which meant that if Lincoln’s No Kings rally was a government agency, it would have been unceremoniously closed, lest its DEI energy infect the local body politic.
I saw no masked federal agents, but the faces and nametags of two local police officers riding by on bicycles were in full view. Sprinkled among the crowd were some counter-protestors, others touting personal causes and, I’m guessing, a few professional people watchers and assorted looky-loos there to enjoy the view. 
News reports peg the total number of people at No Kings events at 7 million, a couple million more than showed up in June. Despite the sophomoric, name-calling and lies about who was there and why, that’s a whole lot of dissent. Which, last I checked, is a hallmark of our democratic republic and the right and responsibility of citizens living in one.

Moneywise, WalletHub, Forbes, and Yahoo Finance reported recently that Florida is the second most distressed state in the union in terms of its residents’ debt obligations.
The state saw a 23% increase in the share of people with distressed bank accounts between 2024 and 2025, the data show. In addition, Florida holds the sixth-highest overall share of people with accounts in distress, at 7.3%.
“Measuring the share of residents in financial distress is a good way to take the pulse of a state and see whether people are generally thriving or having trouble making ends meet,” said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst.
“When you combine data about people delaying payments with other metrics like bankruptcy filings and credit score changes, it paints a good picture of the overall economic trends of a state,” he added.
In human terms, this financial distress looks like a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings; residents with accounts in forbearance or deferred payments; America’s lowest average credit scores; and higher prices for groceries, rent, mortgages, gasoline, and health care.
Americans are struggling to pay their bills, even turning to credit to pay for essentials. A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.
“The last few years have been a whirlwind for Americans’ finances, with inflation, fluctuating unemployment, public health crises and natural disasters making it hard for people across the country to pay their bills,” the WalletHub website says.
In the most recent presidential election, political pundits say, the electorate voted for Donald Trump because of their anxiety and deep frustration with the price of everything.
Electoral implications
According to Clare Goudreau of the Johns Hopkins Hub, “Rising costs were top of mind as voters cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election. According to exit polls from CBS News, 75% of voters reported that inflation had caused moderate or severe hardship for them over the past year, with 45% saying they were worse off now than they were four years ago. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end inflation and strengthen the economy.”
Trump’s promise has fallen flat as inflation has spiraled upwards since he assumed office in January. Corporate greed; Trump’s zig-zag, on-again-off-again tariff folly; and economic factors that most folks don’t understand continue to upend ordinary people’s lives.
A significant swath of Floridians are feeling considerable pain, caught in “working homelessness,” trying to cope with the affordable housing crisis, stagnant wages, medical debt, and student-loan and credit card debt. Meanwhile, wages and salaries fall far short of supporting families.
Meanwhile, economic data show that Florida’s economy ostensibly is strong, with a GDP of $1.76 trillion after years of explosive expansion. While the state is expected to continue outperforming the national average in GDP growth, the rate is expected to slow to more typical, sustainable levels in coming years.
This is not unlike the stock market, which has experienced heady growth for the last several years. The market closed the first half of 2025 at record highs, recovering from an April drop. Some analysts see potential for further gains. Experts see Big Tech, international stocks, and AI-related companies as potential areas of continued outperformance.
The downturn has already begun
But the wealth isn’t trickling down.
A Florida Realtors report notes that, as of mid-2025, a family of four in Florida needs an annual income of $217,651 to live “comfortably,” including savings and discretionary spending. This is significantly higher than the state’s median income.
As deleterious as these circumstances for Florida families, more danger lies ahead.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, says the U.S. economy is standing on shaky ground and, for many states, the downturn has already begun. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia are showing clear signs of recession, marked by economic weakness and job losses that are likely to continue. Another 13 states are “treading water,” he said.
Zandi told MarketWatch, “The economy is still not in recession, but the risks are very high. We’re on the precipice,” as quoted in the report. He warned that the overall U.S. economy is vulnerable and could be pushed into a contraction by even a modest shock.
Much of this weakness stems from economic policy, Zandi said. He noted that Trump’s tariffs on imported goods have created growing uncertainty, disrupted global supply chains, and forced companies to halt plans to expand. A lack of labor-force growth this year has also contributed to the slowdown, he said.
Their problems are driven largely by a mix of slowing immigration, increasing tariffs, and federal job cuts, Zandi argues.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and his MAGA cohort are distracted, however, consolidating political power at the expense of the populace, punishing their enemies and rewarding their friends, and leveraging state and federal funds to bully perceived enemies into compliance. Floridians must organize at the grass roots to fight back.
As the 2024 presidential election showed, in poll after poll, inflation was a major factor in how people voted; now, bubbling anger over the high cost of living can fuel the removal of incumbents.
Floridians concerned about the high cost of living must force government officials to spend more on healthcare, affordable housing, education, higher wages, and support of labor unions so that residents can gain higher incomes.
They have no choice.

Here is Part One.
In the face of current events, depolarizing our politics is imperative now more than ever. 


I attended Johnson & Wales University for culinary arts. I worked in kitchens 12 hours a day between class and my full-time job, and quickly became burnt out. This was at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign when I told myself, “There’s no way Donald Trump becomes President.”
Shortly after, I switched my major to political science. Since then, I have had countless political conversations turn into arguments. Some feel very silly in hindsight, such as when I argued with another student about whether college classes should require attendance. Others feel much more salient, such as my wife and I having different views on abortion.

David McGraw
After many political fights over the years, I knew something needed to change. So I contacted Braver Angels, an organization I was familiar with, but never truly engaged with. Integrating my experiences with what I learned from Braver Angels, the following skills are how I have better political conversations. Some of this advice may be self-evident, others more challenging, but trust the process.
Define your terms; not everyone means the same thing even if we use the same words. Do not go into a political conversation trying to change someone’s mind.  Lastly, we have more to learn from people we disagree with than those we agree with.
Toward the end of my Political Science degree study, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in New Zealand. One of my roommates and I were up late one night, and politics came up. I do not remember the topic, but what stands out in my memory is that the conversation lasted three hours. Most of the conversation was spent in respectful disagreement until we approached the last hour. This is when I finally asked, “What do you mean when you say . . .” I finally realized that the past two hours had been spent talking around with each other because we had different definitions of the terms we were using. In fact, around 1 a.m., we decided to call it quits because we had actually agreed on the political topic the whole time, not having realized it.
Define your terms. My next principle for better political conversations is much more difficult: Do not try to change people’s minds.
What!? I know what you’re thinking, “Isn’t the point of talking to people about politics to change their minds?” Yes, it is, but how we change minds is more important. Many go into these conversations thinking, “If I just have the right argument, I can logic my opponent into a corner, then they’ll have to take my side! (insert corny maniacal laugh here)” People need to trust you have good intentions to be open to changing their minds. It goes without saying that we aren’t listening when we devote our mental energy to our rebuttal.
Right after college, I joined an AmeriCorps program called City Year.
As someone who believes a life well lived is done in service to others, helping at-risk youth succeed in their education seemed perfect for me. Behind the scenes, I encountered constant political disagreements with my coworkers. At first, we could remain cordial, hoping to convince each other to their side. As time passed, conversations became more tense until the worst of the arguments occurred about halfway through the school year. Looking back on my behavior, I was not listening to them. I thought I could logic my way to getting them on my side, but they did not trust that I had good intentions behind my political beliefs.
Like most of us, I have good intentions; none of the worst stereotypes levied against my side of the political spectrum apply to me. However, I did not earn their trust before expressing why I thought they were wrong. Changing people’s minds about a political position takes time. It stands to reason that few will keep an open mind to admitting they may have been wrong if they are not truly being listened to in the first place.
My frustration at City Year led me to act in ways that cost me friendships. So that your political differences don’t cost you yours, prioritize active listening, and seek to understand your conversation partner’s belief, not some caricature propagated by pundits you agree with. Develop a foundation of trust first, then make the case for your position.
This begs the question, why should we even want friendships across the aisle? After all, aren’t “those people” hateful or bigoted? Not as often as political pundits would have you think.
We have more to learn from those we disagree with than those we agree with. They fill the gaps in our knowledge and point to things we may never have considered. Only by rejecting homogeneous thinking can we gain the whole picture. As people become more geographically segregated by political beliefs, keeping and maintaining relationships across the aisle becomes increasingly tricky. This is where Braver Angels comes in. Many of their virtual events allow us to meet people we would normally never interact with.
I want a future with less political violence. Recently, we have seen quite a lot of it, between the assassination of Melissa Hortman, her husband, and Charlie Kirk. Political violence is unacceptable, no matter who the target, but it will continue if we allow our communication to break down. If you want to keep the conversation going, I hope to see you at a Braver Angels event soon!
Peace be with you.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The revenge of ‘elderly white hippies’,Viewpoints Contributor and Christine Palm,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/the-revenge-of-elderly-white-hippies/,"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” Let's break that down.,","“We, the People” marched, shouted, sang, honked, hugged and high-fived in more than 2,600 cities and towns across the country on Saturday.
My husband, some friends and I chose to head to Old Saybrook, rather than Hartford, because a small local crowd has a different kind of visibility than does a large urban one. The GOP too often dismisses city protests because, you know, that’s where all the bad people are. Still, we were nearly 2,000 strong in Old Saybrook, a town nationally known more for Katharine Hepburn than anything else.
So, who, exactly, is protesting?
Recently, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” At that same Washington, D.C. press conference he also characterized the preponderance of protesters as “Communists” and “stupid.” And on several occasions, the Trump White House has characterized the resistance as “violent” and “dangerous.”
How accurate is Miller’s characterization? Let’s break it down.
Accusation No. 1: “Elderly.” Depends on where you live. Connecticut skews older (it’s the seventh oldest state, with 18 percent of its population over 65, and a median age of 41). Suburban towns historically skew older than do cities. So, yes, most of the folks I marched with Saturday had gray hair. However, in places where the median age is younger (around 38 in both New York City and Portland, Oregon, for example) the crowd was predominantly young.
And let’s pretend, for a moment, that all the protesters were old. So what? Many of us older folks are willing to take a hit to our reputations, even risking physical assault and arrest, if it means our children can remain safe, and our nation can survive this authoritarian takeover. I have a friend in her 80s who was arrested three times last summer protesting the fossil fuel industry. Stephen Miller, at the tender age of 40, probably can’t imagine being that brave.

And The Alliance for Retired Americans urged its members not to be offended by his remarks, saying, “Don’t let yourself think that he doesn’t understand the power of older Americans getting together and mobilizing.”
On to adjective No. 2: “White.”
Again, this gross characterization is only partially correct. People of color did, in fact, turn out. But the very question of their participation needs to be examined. More than 92 percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris and Black women led the charge across the country in preserving voting rights against orchestrated voter suppression. Have they earned the right to kick back a bit? I think so.
And when ICE agents are clearly targeting Black and brown citizens, one cannot blame people of color for fearing the worst. While it’s too early for definitive demographic data on this weekend’s “No Kings” rallies, historically, Black and brown citizens have protested at disproportionately higher numbers than their slice of their overall population would indicate. 
In 2020, for example, a PEW Research Center survey reported that 17 percent of Blacks protested in race-related campaigns, while they composed just 14 percent of the general public. And 22 percent of people of Hispanic heritage protested in such rallies, despite making up just 19 percent of all American adults. In comparison, while white Americans make up nearly 64 percent of the population, fewer than 46 percent participated in a race-related protest.
Accusation No. 3: “Hippies.” Well, guilty as charged, if by “Hippy” Miller means someone who values peace over violence, justice over injustice, creativity over conformity, environmentalism over destruction of the planet, community over capitalist greed, and the best rock music of all time over whatever drivel plays in his poor tormented head.
No. 4, his broad umbrella of “Communists.” Well, many of the folks marching Saturday were U.S. Veterans. One of them, a Navy guy from Lyme named Pete Lang, said, “I’m here because I fought against everything that’s happening to our country.”
My friend Jane Cavanaugh of Deep River, whose husband is a veteran, unfurled the  enormous American flag given to her by the government upon the death of her father, who fought in WWII. While the White House insists there is a shadowy underground called “Antifa,” they are too stupid to (or deliberately obtuse) to acknowledge the 16 million men and women who served in WWII were the original Anti-Fascists.
And I imagine that the families of the 416,800 soldiers who died fighting the fascists are struggling to understand why those deaths have been officially disrespected by the U.S. government.
No. 5: “Violent and dangerous.” Um, when did we protestors go from “snowflakes,” “woke,” “cat ladies” and other monikers suggesting frailty, to, in Miller’s words, “a vast domestic terror movement?” If he’s afraid of people in frog costumes, a bunch of Portlanders riding nude on bicycles, and American-flag wavers singing “We Shall Overcome,” no wonder elderly white hippies are cause for concern.
Unfortunately for Donald Trump and his staff, once again, the facts don’t support their claim. Following the shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, PBS did an analysis of political violence in America. They said, “Based on our own research and a review of related work, we can confidently say that most domestic terrorists in the U.S. are politically on the right, and right-wing attacks account for the vast majority of fatalities from domestic terrorism.”
Now, let’s look at “stupid.” From the ebulliently zany to the gravely dignified, I’ve met and talked with lots of protesters. I can’t think of one I’d characterize as stupid. Heartbroken? Yes. Indignant, fearful, and furious? Of course. But ignorant of the facts? Nope. Unaware of the fascist takeover and indifferent to the loss of our democracy? Not on your life.
Stephen Miller is a puffed-up little rooster who has forsworn his heritage in order to orchestrate the Trump regime’s anti-immigration stance. He wouldn’t be here had America not opened her Ellis Island gates to Wolf Glosser, Miller’s maternal great-great grandfather on January 7, 1903. Glosser was fleeing anti-semitic Russian pogroms, and followed a path not unlike that of many foreigners who emigrated to America. The difference is, the rest of us are proud of our ancestors, and many of us protest in their name. So while Miller has conveniently forgotten what he owes to immigration, we have not.
Finally, Miller is under the wrong impression that we “elderly white hippies” will “all need to go home and take a nap because  (we’re) all over 90 years old.”
We’ve lived through economic travails, assassinations, wars, illness and hardships he can’t even imagine. We’re not napping, we’re fighting back: loudly, proudly, and without end, for as long as it takes until Trump and his defenders are swept into the history books along all the other dupes and toadies who put the cult of personality over the Constitution.
No, we’re not napping, Stephen Miller. Our eyes are wide open, and we see you.

“People fought and died for us to have the rights we have,” 61-year-old Tracie Benner of Juniata County said outside the state Capitol in Harrisburg, where between 5,000 and 6,000 people gathered. “And now for Trump and the Supreme Court and the Congress to just throw it away, we won’t stand for that.”

Since taking office in January, Trump’s government has slashed federal agencies and congressionally approved funding, indicted political foes and massively ramped up indiscriminate immigration law enforcement. And with a conservative U.S. Supreme Court majority secured by Trump’s three first-term appointments, the high court has repeatedly allowed administration policies to move forward through its shadow docket.

“If you ever look around and think, ‘Am I going mad? Is this really happening?’ You’re not crazy. You’re not alone,” said Justin Douglas, a pastor and Democratic Dauphin County Commissioner at a rally Saturday afternoon in Hershey. “We need moments like this right here where we’re out of social media, we’re in the real world, we’re standing in a park together in our community.”
Similar demonstrations were held in Pittsburgh, State College, the Lehigh Valley and deep red Butler County as part of the national No Kings movement, organized by a coalition of civil rights groups that claimed 7 million people participated nationwide.
An estimated 20,000 people gathered at Philadelphia’s City Hall and marched a mile on Market Street to Independence Hall, where the nation’s foundational documents were drafted, debated and adopted by delegates from the 13 original states. 
Speakers included three of the Philadelphia region’s Democratic U.S. Reps. Brendan Boyle, Madeleine Dean and Mary Gay Scanlon; District Attorney Larry Krasner; and Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes.
On the Montgomery County Courthouse steps, protest leaders in Revolutionary War garb read passages from the Declaration of Independence and listed what they said are the Trump administration’s violations of the U.S. Constitution.
“Americans like their freedom,” Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer of Community Change for Montgomery County, said. “It’s just getting to the point where people really need to know that they need to come out and stand up against it.”

Many of the estimated 1,500 people who filled the courthouse plaza in Norristown, seat of the commonwealth’s third-most populous county, were protesting for the first time, Vincent said. 
“A big part of these kinds of protests is just people realizing that they’re not alone,” she said. “That there are other people that think like they do and care about the things that they care about.”
In Harrisburg and across the U.S., protesters arrived wearing inflatable dinosaur, cow and shark costumes in order to dial back tension and draw attention to violent police tactics used against protesters elsewhere.

“Honestly, it just feels very American to me,” Amy, the woman wearing the pink axolotl costume, said. She declined to give her last name. “We’re just such a serious bunch, you know? We try our best to just fight for our rights and everything, but we still know how to have fun.”

Don Coleman, 69, said he attended the rally at the Capitol because he’s concerned about subversion of the constitution, especially with a Congress and Supreme Court that he views as beholden to the president. But beyond the actions of the U.S. government, he’s worried about polarization of the American people.

Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive for the shooting in Leland, but the FBI says it may have been “sparked by a disagreement among several individuals.” At least nine people have been arrested, several of them charged with capital murder.
The death of Ebanee Williams was reported Friday by the coroner’s office in Hinds County, which encompasses the state capital, according to a news release Saturday from LaQuesha Watkins, the coroner in Washington County where Leland is located. 
More than a dozen people were wounded in the shooting, and several were taken to other cities for medical care. The violence broke out late in the evening of Oct. 11 as people were gathered in Leland’s tiny downtown to celebrate homecoming weekend. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
Leland, on the state’s western edge, is home to fewer than 4,000 people, and the FBI’s Jackson Field Office has been posting pictures of suspects wanted for questioning.

For many Detroiters, shouting and holding up their signs is a way to resist the Republicans’ latest demand for Michigan: Deploy the National Guard to Detroit for what JD Vance called “serious crime problems” during a speech at a manufacturing plant in Howell last month. 
That prompted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, to say “it’s only a matter of time” before Trump tries to send National Guard troops to cities in the Great Lakes State as he did to other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, and others.
“Good luck with that,” Sandra Therrian, a Detroit resident, who attended Saturday’s rally, said. “No, they’re not going to be allowed in Chicago. They shouldn’t try to come too. We don’t need them. We don’t want them. They can go to their Republican places that have far more crime than we do. We take care of our own here.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” was one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one would continue.
“It is encouraging. I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back,” McMorrow said to the Advance.” We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
By the end of Saturday, Trump had responded to the No Kings” protests with a 19-second AI-generated video in which he is portrayed as a crown-wearing bomber pilot, in a plane labeled “King Trump”, dropping excrement on protesters. 
A march downtown and an arrest
As the crowd of protesters began a peaceful march from the park, down Michigan Avenue toward the Patrick McNamara Federal building, “No Trump, no troops” was one of the chants the several thousand participants made along the way.

The sole disturbance came from Andre Williams, 24, a MAGA influencer with a megaphone who disrupted the march, circling the crowd of demonstrators in attempts to enter it. He was part of a small number of counter-protesters who also showed up at the No Kings rally and march.
“I came here by myself; I don’t respond to any organization. I am here for my country,” Williams said, while being surrounded by some protesters who tried to pull him away from the crowd. 
“Immigration is killing our country; it is killing Western values. It is taking away my jobs for the American working class,” said Williams.
“I’m unconcerned. He’s looking for views,” said Theoderic Strider, a Florida trans man who recently moved to Detroit to escape that state’s anti-trans and anti-gay legislation. 
“It’s more important to be kind to your neighbors than pretty much anything else right now,” said Strider.
Williams had also shown up at the June’s No Kings protest in Detroit, and as he was then, Williams was confronted by protesters attempting to de-escalate the situation. However, Williams avoided advancing further among the protesters on the road and ran toward those at the entrance of the federal building, where he was blocked by participants. 
Shoving then broke out between those who wanted to throw him out and those demanding that the situation stop. Police arrived and, pulling him by his arms, arrested Williams, and took him into custody. 
A request for comment to Detroit Police about what charges, if any, were filed against Williams was returned Sunday afternoon.
“Adult male was arrested for disorderly conduct. No further information is available regarding the arrest. He was the only one arrested during march,” the email stated.
After listening to final speeches, the protesters returned to Roosevelt Park, ending the No Kings protest with chants still echoing through the streets of Detroit.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-19 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Southern lawmakers say infant mortality rates could worsen with health care cuts,Torrence Banks,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/19/southern-lawmakers-say-infant-mortality-rates-could-worsen-with-health-care-cuts/,"In Mississippi, which has the highest rate of infant mortality, health officials declared a state of emergency this year after the rate increased.","The infant mortality rate, a stat that tracks deaths of infants before their first birthdays, in many Southern states is higher than average for the U.S. — Mississippi’s health department even declared a state of emergency this year after the rate of infant deaths increased.
Lawmakers and medical experts say that health care spending cuts and restrictions on services could make things worse.
“These are states that historically have struggled both with infant mortality and maternal mortality,” Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock told NOTUS. “Medicaid is part of a safety net that impacts overall health. When that safety net is broken, things like infant mortality are impacted as well as chronic disease.”

Democrats warn that a confluence of factors could lead to fewer people accessing care, potentially with dire consequences. The reconciliation bill that became law this summer cuts $1.1 trillion in Medicaid. Enhanced subsidies in the Affordable Care Act will expire in December, resulting in increased premiums in 2026 for millions if not extended — something Democrats have demanded in exchange for their votes to reopen the government — and potentially lowering the rate of people getting care. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2034, the number of people left uninsured could increase to 11.8 million.
States in the South would be disproportionately affected if the enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t extended. According to analysis from the Urban Institute, Louisiana would see the steepest decline in subsidized marketplace enrollment in the country.
Many of these states — including Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina — have traditionally had infant mortality rates on the higher end of the spectrum. Nationwide, the infant mortality was 5.61 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023; in Mississippi, which has the worst rate of infant mortality, the rate was 8.94 deaths per 1,000 live births. That number climbed in 2024 to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Dr. James Bauerband, a retired OBGYN based in Georgia, told NOTUS that the strain that Medicaid cuts have put on rural hospitals could cause the infant mortality rates in Southern states to increase.
“I understand you don’t want to have to insure people that could get insurance on their own and want to incentivize getting a job and getting good insurance,” Bauerband said. “But, there has to be the safety nets, and I think that making sure Medicaid is well-funded is something they really ought to do.”
Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently did a study analyzing the impact that the Dobbs Supreme Court case decision had on infant mortality in states and found that there were “higher than expected” mortality rates “in states after adoption of abortion bans.”
She said the Trump administration’s termination of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System could lead to a lower understanding of infant mortality. The monitoring system collected insights from moms before and after giving birth, asking questions regarding alcohol use and stress during pregnancy, among others.
“Those are all things that we can’t capture in a birth certificate data source,” Gemmill said. “And that was a really important data for people like me to figure out what’s going on with pregnancy health in the nation, in a state over time. And they completely canceled that program.”
“So now it’s like we don’t even have the data to inform strategies on how to improve rates of pre-term birth infant mortality,” she added.
Democrats believe these reforms have lasting consequences.
“Not enough mamas get prenatal care, partly because of cost, and partly because of access,” Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “Finding places that can treat them can be a real challenge. The Medicaid cuts will impact infant mortality, both for the people who are cut out of health care access, and also for people who depend on rural hospitals and community health centers that can’t survive the cuts and will close.”
Republicans have also raised concerns about infant mortality rates. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican whose state has more than 60 rural hospitals, told NOTUS that he wants to extend the funding for rural hospitals provided under the law from 2026 to 2030.
If changes take effect after that time, cuts to Medicaid could cause infant mortality rates to go up, he said.
“I want to make sure that that doesn’t happen,” he told NOTUS. “Under the president’s reconciliation bill, there’s increased funding for rural hospitals now for the next couple of years. … I want to see that extended.”
Some of the Republicans who voted against the reconciliation bill stopped short of saying its Medicaid cuts could affect infant mortality rates.
“We’ve had an infant mortality rate problem in this country for years,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who cited health care as her reason for voting against the reconciliation bill, told NOTUS. “This is not new, and it does warrant research to find out why we also have huge racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.”
North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who also voted against the bill, called the country’s infant mortality rate “unacceptably high,” with root causes including poverty and substance abuse. However, he didn’t see the correlation between Medicaid cuts and infant mortality rates.
“I haven’t seen any data,” Tillis said. “Maybe some people would say that. But they’d have to be statistically, not politically, motivated to catch my attention. I just haven’t studied it.”
Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt called on Democrats to support her legislation to help support women during the prenatal, postpartum and early childhood years of pregnancy. Britt told NOTUS that she will continue to work across the aisle to address it.
“That’s something we’ve got to get to the bottom of … find out what is the root cause,” Britt said.

It’s sunset

Step outside.
The breeze is blowing
wisps of cirrus cloud.
The sky is blue,
the geese are leaving.
Farewell,
we say,
and don’t mean it.
Mean it, please, for once.
The turning leaves will thank you.
The frost has come
quietly along, its hands bound.
Cut it free.
Run your hands through the asters,
the goldenrod…
through the sunlight at the end of the street,
always just around the bend.

This article was originally published by Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom.

On the afternoon of August 1, 1993, the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department got a call to check out the ballfields in Munford, Alabama. When they arrived, they discovered a man’s badly burned body lying underneath an oak tree where spectators would sit to watch softball games. A pair of cinderblocks were nearby, and a charred wooden board was next to him.
Unable to identify the body, the state’s forensic pathologist cut off a hand during the autopsy in order to take fingerprints. They came back as a match for Gregory “New York” Huguley, 32, who lived in Anniston, about 20 minutes north of Munford.
The following month, Maurice Boyd, who was in the third grade at the time, returned home from school to find his mother sitting at the counter frantically trying to track down his older brother, Anthony Boyd. Officers from the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department had visited their house looking to ask him some questions. After Anthony returned home from walking their dog, a rottweiler named Secret, he headed back out to talk with police, as his mother begged him not to go. Maurice remembered Anthony reassuring her that there was nothing to worry about because he didn’t have anything to hide.

“That was the last time he was around,” Maurice, now 42, told me. Soon after, he learned that his brother Anthony, along with three of his friends—Shawn Ingram, Moneek Marcell Ackles, and Dwinaune Quintay Cox—had been arrested for Huguley’s death.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Anthony, charging that he didn’t kill Huguley but was equally culpable because he was an accomplice. Anthony maintained that he had no involvement in Huguley’s death.
Facing the threat of the electric chair, one of the men, Cox, struck a deal with prosecutors to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for a sentence that would allow him to eventually walk free on parole. There was no physical evidence tying Anthony to the killing, and so Cox became the star witness at his capital murder trial in March 1995. Prosecutors bolstered their case with witnesses who testified to seeing the men kidnap Huguley, but whose stories clashed in significant ways. When it came time to mount Anthony’s defense, his court-appointed lawyer said that he didn’t have enough time to prepare for the case and failed to call witnesses to corroborate Anthony’s alibi. He was quickly convicted.
Maurice testified during the second part of the trial, when the jury was tasked with deciding whether to sentence his brother to death or spare his life with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. He spoke about Anthony coaching him in basketball, helping him with his homework, and taking him to the movies and to Six Flags, and asked that the jury let his brother live.
At the end of the trial, which lasted just three days, Anthony was sentenced to death by a jury vote of 10–2. (Alabama and Florida are the only two states that allow death sentences to be handed down even when all jurors don’t agree.) He told The Anniston Star through tears, “I’ll maintain my innocence until the day I die, which I guess will be in the electric chair.”
After Boyd’s trial, his co-defendant Ingram was also sentenced to death, while Ackles was sentenced to life without parole. Cox, who took the stand against all of them, was freed in 2009.
This past August, Maurice was at work when he saw on social media that Alabama had set Anthony’s execution date for Oct. 23. The state is planning to execute him with nitrogen gas, an experimental method that involves suffocating prisoners to death.
“I was thrown,” Maurice said of the news. “Being boxed in a cage for the majority of your life, it kind of sends me spiraling sometimes, and now it’s a little worse to know…there’s a date, and the clock is ticking, and it’s ticking fast.”
America’s death penalty capital 
Anthony Boyd and his co-defendants were tried in Talladega County, in the north central part of the state about an hour’s drive from Birmingham. The rural area is best known for its NASCAR racetrack and access to the Talladega National Forest, but it was also America’s death penalty capital during the 1980s and 90s. The county of around 74,000 was responsible for about 10 percent of Alabama’s death row population, and its juries and judges sentenced more people to die per capita than any other state at the time.
Leading the prosecution was then-District Attorney Robert Rumsey, a former district judge who took office in 1978. By the end of Rumsey’s tenure 20 years later, he had sent 12 people to death row. A 2001 investigation by The Birmingham Post-Herald found that half the people sent to death row from Talladega County were Black, Boyd among them. This mirrored the larger statewide trend; while Black people make up just a quarter of Alabama’s population, nearly half the people on the state’s death row are Black. In 1992, the Alabama Supreme Court found that Rumsey had illegally struck 11 out of 15 potential Black jurors in the capital murder case of a Black woman and ordered a new trial.
Boyd, unable to afford an attorney, was represented by William Willingham, who dabbled in criminal defense, juvenile work, divorce cases, and wrote up power of attorney authorizations and deeds. He’d also previously worked for Rumsey in the DA’s office for four years. In the five capital cases he later tried against Rumsey, Willingham lost all of them. He lauded his old boss in comments to the media on his prowess in death penalty cases. “It was pretty tough against him. As prosecutors go, he was one of the best,” Willingham told The Post-Herald in 2001 for its series “Talladega: Death Row Country.”
Willingham was paid just $1,000 for his work on Boyd’s case, the standard for court appointed lawyers at the time and an imbalance that judges were unsympathetic to. At one pre-trial conference, Willingham said he didn’t want to be appointed to the case because he had to prioritize better paid work. “I just didn’t have any time to prepare for it, plus it gets to be pretty much pro bono work after a certain point,” he told Judge Jerry Fielding, who was overseeing Boyd’s case.

At another hearing, Willingham learned that he would have just over a month to review discovery in the case before going to trial. When he pushed back against the short timeline, Fielding replied, “I think a month is a reasonable length of time for you to get ready.”
Boyd was 23 when the trial got underway. The prosecution said that he and his co-defendants kidnapped Huguley in a blue Astro van in Anniston in the early evening of Saturday, July 31, 1993, then drove him to Munford—where they then duct taped Huguley to a bench, doused him with gasoline, and burned him alive because he had stolen $200 worth of crack cocaine. Prosecutors said that someone else had forced Huguley into the van and lit the match to set him on fire, but argued that Boyd was complicit in Huguley’s death because he was in the van and had duct taped Huguley’s legs and feet to the bench.
Willingham’s lack of preparation was evident from the start. He hadn’t obtained the grand jury testimony a week before the trial, didn’t subpoena four witnesses, hadn’t interviewed any of the prosecutions’ witnesses, and largely relied on notes from Rumsey, his old boss, for his understanding of what they might say on the stand.
Willingham also failed to call witnesses who might have corroborated Boyd’s alibi that he was at a birthday party in Anniston and spent the night at a motel with his girlfriend when Huguley was murdered.
On the first day of the trial, Willingham told the judge that 12 of the witnesses he wanted to call were missing.
The state had its own problems getting witnesses to come to court, but unlike Willingham, it took forceful measures to get them on the stand, including rounding up some under detainers.
In his opening statement, Rumsey explained that he was able to seek the death penalty for Boyd because of the state’s felony murder law, which stipulated that Boyd was responsible for Huguley’s death even if he didn’t light the match that killed him. (Between 2009 and 2017, 83 percent of people charged with felony murder in Alabama were Black.)
“For example, in a bank robbery you’ve got three people in a car and one person sits there and drives the car and two people go in and rob the bank,” Rumsey told jurors. “The guy driving the car is just as guilty as the two that goes in.”
Joseph Embry, the state’s medical examiner and toxicologist who testified about the results of Huguley’s autopsy, said the presence of soot in Huguley’s lungs showed that he was burned alive, and there were traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system and food still in his stomach. Embry said there was evidence of duct tape on Huguley’s face and right forearm, but he didn’t note any such evidence on his legs—where prosecutors said Boyd taped him to the bench. He also said he couldn’t pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, only saying that his body, which was discovered on a Sunday afternoon, was “fresh” and consistent with dying over that weekend.
“And there’s nothing in your examination of the body or any of the findings you made which would link Anthony Boyd to causing the burns on that body is there?” Willingham asked the medical examiner.
“No, sir,” Embry replied.
Police investigators also testified that they’d lifted fingerprints from cans found near Huguley but none of them matched Boyd or his co-defendants.
Without any forensic evidence tying Boyd to the crime, the state relied on the testimony of nine witnesses, whose stories shifted and at times contradicted the facts that prosecutors had laid out.
Cox’s brother, Donique Cox, claimed during his trial testimony that Boyd had told him that “they” shot and killed Huguley, even though there was no evidence that Huguley had been shot. Under cross-examination, Donique, who was 18, said he only talked to police after his brother cut a deal with prosecutors.
Just four of the supposedly dozens of people hanging out near where Huguley was said to be abducted wound up testifying. Each story varied in significant ways—critically, whether they saw Ingram threaten Huguley with a gun or if they even saw Boyd in the van. The one witness who testified to seeing Ingram with a gun and Boyd inside the van was later contradicted by testimony from her aunt, who told jurors that she’d seen her in front of her house all day, miles away from the scene of Huguley’s abduction.
Another witness—who only testified after prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant and police searched five different houses to find and bring her to court—told jurors about hearing Boyd, Ackles, and Ingram discuss Huguley and accuse him of stealing their drugs prior to his death, though she said she couldn’t remember who said what.
During Ingram’s trial, which happened two months after Boyd’s, the same witness admitted to using crack during the time she was testifying about and was now in jail for an assault charge. Ingram’s trial also revealed how witnesses had changed their statements in key ways since first talking to police, like whether they’d even seen Ingram that day—with one man telling police during his initial statement that Ingram wasn’t there when he was shown a picture of him.
Mike McBurnett, the lead investigator on the case for the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department, told me last month that he remembered it well because of how difficult it was to find witnesses. Most were scared to talk or didn’t want to be labeled a snitch. “One of them was on probation, and I think we got his probation officer to find him for us,” he said. “I mean, none of them just jumped up.”
The threat of a death sentence
As police struggled to wrangle witnesses, prosecutors tried to get the co-defendants to testify against each other.
Boyd says he declined their offer of life without parole sentence in exchange for his testimony, because he believed he wouldn’t be convicted. Ingram, who initially struck a deal that would’ve given him a sentence of life with parole eligibility, backed out, even after Fielding, the judge, seemingly tried to convince him to testify. “Do you understand you are deciding your fate?” the judge asked.
When Cox also backed out of the plea deal, Fielding repeatedly reminded him that his decision could lead to him being sentenced to die in the electric chair. Even when Cox told him that he would not testify, Fielding continued to push the issue.
“You have set your life on a course that could very easily lead you to being electrocuted,” the judge said during Boyd’s trial while the jury wasn’t present.
Later that day, Cox decided he would testify after all. Under questioning, he said he’d reassessed his odds of winning his case after meeting with his aunt and grandmother back at the jail.
McBurnett, the investigator, said the threat of a death sentence played a large part in persuading him to talk. “You’re trying to always get somebody to turn against the other one,” he said. “None of them sit down and tell you the truth. You just got to get as much as you can, and then get somebody to cooperate.”
Cox was the only witness to testify about Huguley’s death at Boyd’s trial. He testified that he met up with Boyd, Ingram, and Ackles that Saturday evening, while there was still daylight but it was starting to get dark outside, to look for someone who’d robbed Boyd. After driving around with Ackles in his blue van, Cox said they spotted Huguley, who wasn’t the original target but had also stolen from Boyd. According to Cox, Ingram got out of the passenger side of the van with Cox’s gun, a MAC-11, and told him to get into the van. Cox testified that Huguley replied, “Please, don’t kill me. Just beat me.”
Cox said that Ingram then grabbed Huguley by the arm and pushed him onto the floor of the van. After that, he said that Ackles dropped him off at his car, which he then used to follow the van.
Cox testified that it was “dusk dark” once they arrived at the ballfield. He said Ingram ordered Huguley to lay down on a bench then Ackles taped Huguley’s mouth and hands, while Boyd taped his feet to the bench. According to Cox, Ingram then doused gasoline on Huguley and made a trail around him before lighting it with a match. He said they watched him burn for 10 or 15 minutes before Huguley rolled off the bench and the fire went out. After that, Cox said Boyd got into his car with him and told him, “We all in this together now.” Cox testified that he dropped off Boyd then went back to his aunt’s house, where he stayed the rest of the night.
Under questioning from Willingham, Cox admitted that a significant part of his story had changed between his initial statement to police in October 1993 and the one he gave as part of his plea deal, in late June 1994. In the first statement, for instance, he told investigators that he stayed with Ackles, Ingram, and Boyd in the van after the kidnapping and that they rode as a group to the ballfield. He later changed his story to say that he was dropped off at his car after they picked up Huguley and followed them on his own to the scene of the murder.
“But you weren’t telling the truth back in October, you saying now, when you say you were in the van the whole time?” Willingham asked.
“Right, because then in October I didn’t have an agreement,” replied Cox. “And then when I signed the agreement, [Cox’s lawyer] told me that if I testify falsely and get caught in a lie, that the agreement could be breached. So, that’s when I changed my story.”
Prosecutors said the murder happened between 7:30 and 8 o’clock that Saturday evening, but none of the witnesses who testified to seeing Huguley’s kidnapping could remember what time they saw it happen. Some said it was “dusk dark” outside, while another witness called it mid-dark but had said in his initial statement to police that he saw them after dark. (Sunset that day was at 7:46 pm.)
During Boyd’s defense, Willingham called a witness who was at the ballfields that evening around the time that Cox said Huguley was killed; the witness said that when he left at “dusk dark” there were “a lot of people still there… At least a few hundred anyway.”
The testimony suggested that there would have likely been other witnesses at the fields during the time when Boyd was said to have helped kill Huguley. Willingham did not pursue that discrepancy further, however, and called no other witnesses who were at the field.
Willingham also didn’t call William Mosley, a Munford local who had discovered Huguley’s body on that Sunday afternoon in 1993.
Mosley had told The Anniston Star that he’d discovered Huguley’s body when he got to the field around 3:40 pm on Sunday to assess conditions before the day’s game, and that Huguley was “still bleeding a little out of his head.” That would have been roughly 20 hours after the prosecution’s time of death.
Other witnesses cast doubt on Cox’s testimony, including three people who testified about seeing him and Boyd at a party late that Saturday night, even though he said he spent the entire night at his aunt’s following the murder.
In the years since, Boyd’s post conviction lawyers have said Willingham’s performance fell short of constitutional standards. For instance, they’ve said he never consulted an independent forensic expert to try and pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, which they say could have been done with testing on the cocaine, food and alcohol still in his system.
Boyd’s appellate lawyers also wrote that Willingham had failed to properly interview witnesses who would’ve corroborated Boyd’s alibi or call into question other parts of the prosecution’s narrative; for example, they say other witnesses recalled Ackles being out of town at the time Cox said they killed Huguley. They said Willingham failed to look into another prosecution witness who had a history of mental illness that could have called into question the veracity of her testimony.
And they accused prosecutors of illegally withholding records from Willingham, his original defense lawyer, including those that would have helped corroborate his alibi and showed that witnesses were offered “certain inducements” for their testimony.
In the petitions they’ve filed, Boyd’s lawyers have said the evidence they’d uncovered since their client was sent to death row would show that he couldn’t have been at the ballfields at the time Cox said Huguley was killed. But judges have refused to grant Boyd a hearing that would have given him the chance to present additional evidence, largely on the basis that his claims were either already addressed in other courts or found to be without merit.
When I spoke with Willingham in September, he dismissed the criticism of his performance as boilerplate legal arguments during capital case appeals. He also stressed the structural challenges of defending such cases at the time, saying judges then rarely approved funding for an appointed attorney to hire their own forensic expert—let alone pay them fairly for time spent on their own investigation.
“We had to pay rent, keep the lights on, those kinds of things,” he said. “So we were kind of handcuffed, and as far as resources and how much time we can spend on cases.”
Willingham told me he believes Boyd was sentenced to death because Cox got a plea deal first, which he attributes to Cox’s ability to hire a private attorney.
“It’s sometimes that the first one that can cut a deal [who] gets the benefit of either dodging a death penalty or life without parole, and that’s kind of what happened here,” Willingham said.
“It’s always seemed kind of unfair that one of them or maybe sometimes two of them may get a death sentence, and some of them get a life sentence with the possibility of parole, and some of them may get life without parole,” he said. “It seems unfair that they’re not treated all the same.”
Ingram’s appeal lawyers have continued to fight his case. In one petition they filed in federal court in 2017, Ingram’s lawyers alleged that law enforcement had coerced witnesses to testify, writing “There is also information that most of these eye-witnesses were, in fact, picked up by police during an illicit dice-game and forced to testify against Ingram through threats of prosecution.”
A federal district court denied Ingram’s petition and the witnesses’ credibility was never further investigated.
Ackles, Boyd’s co-defendant who is serving a life without parole sentence, told me he contests Cox’s account. “I have never killed anyone and the lies that were told during Anthony Boyd, Shawn Ingram, myself trials were just that, lies.”
Project Hope
I met Boyd in the summer of 2018, when I was working on a story about Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, an anti-death penalty organization run by prisoners on death row in Alabama. I was interviewing members of the group about how they’d come to join it. Boyd, who was sergeant at arms of Project Hope, told me in a measured southern drawl that, “I didn’t even know Alabama had the death penalty. When they told me it was capital murder, I said ‘What is that? All in capital letters?’”
After joining Project Hope, Boyd says he worked to educate himself about the death penalty, and share what he was learning with the public.
“This justice system is set up for the ones who have and to keep the ones who don’t down,” he told me.
Two prisoners formed the organization in 1989 after an intellectually disabled Black man on death row, thought to be innocent, asked them for help. They put together a five-man committee to raise awareness about rampant problems with the administration of the death penalty in Alabama such as racial discrimination, misconduct, and its disparate application to poor people.
The group still meets weekly in the television room at Holman Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in Atmore that houses the state’s death row. During the meetings, its 15 or so members talk about recent death penalty news and discuss legal strategies for their cases. The organization also publishes a quarterly newsletter, On Wings of Hope, where prisoners write about the death penalty and life on death row.

In 2018, Project Hope members learned that they only had five days to decide whether to choose to die by nitrogen over lethal injection, the method Alabama had been using and which appeared to cause long and painful deaths, drawing legal and media scrutiny. The state promised that nitrogen would be more humane than lethal injections, and that prisoners would fall unconscious within seconds. But the state did not share a protocol for how it’d use nitrogen, or give a timeline for when it expected to employ the method. Members of Project Hope spread the word for prisoners to call their attorneys so they could get advice on how to proceed.
Boyd at the time opted for nitrogen, but he says he wasn’t given enough information and that he later changed his mind. In response, the state has said that Boyd should be locked into using the method regardless.
In mid-July, his lawyers filed a challenge saying that Alabama’s plan to use nitrogen violates the Eighth Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment and that the state’s refusal to allow Boyd to see an unredacted protocol is a breach of his rights to due process. Boyd asked to be executed by either hanging, firing squad, or with drugs used for medical aid in dying.
They cited witness reports from the five nitrogen executions conducted so far in Alabama, which began using the method last year, plus one in Louisiana, which first executed a prisoner with nitrogen in March. During those executions, media, legal, and medical witnesses said that prisoners gasped for air, convulsed, and shook violently against the restraints in their final moments. (When I witnessed Alan Miller’s execution in September 2024, he thrashed and jerked on the gurney as his eyes darted back and forth.) Boyd’s lawyers argued that this showed that prisoners were subjected to “conscious suffocation, terror, and pain.”
In early September, Boyd’s team argued their case at an evidentiary hearing featuring testimony from a dozen witnesses, including journalists (among whom was a reporter with Alabama Reflector), lawyers, and medical experts. Deanna Smith, the wife of Kenneth Smith, the first person in the nation to be executed with nitrogen in January 2024, said that witnessing his death was like “watching somebody drown without water.” Other witnesses testified that prisoners appeared awake as they struggled to breathe for minutes.
In response, Alabama’s lawyers have pointed to Boyd’s critical writings about the nitrogen method in On Wings of Hope, Project Hope’s newsletter, as evidence that Boyd knew what he was agreeing to and is only suing now out of gamesmanship. The state has maintained that the method is working as planned and criticized his lawyers for relying on media accounts to build their case, saying that the courts have ruled they are “unreliable evidence” and “highly questionable hearsay.”
On Oct. 9, Emily Marks, the federal district court judge who heard the case, denied Boyd’s challenge, saying that it was filed too late and it was unlikely that he’d win based on the evidence he’d presented. In her ruling, she wrote that reports of prisoners remaining conscious for up to four minutes during their executions “are largely outside of the ADOC’s control and instead depend on the inmate’s behavior—whether voluntary or involuntary.”
Boyd has appealed his case to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. He’s also filed his own challenges in state and federal courts. In one, he alleges that the state has violated his rights by arbitrarily applying the death penalty while other people charged in murder-kidnapping cases received more lenient sentences.
After the state set his execution date, Boyd says he started working to tie up loose ends with Project Hope to pass on leadership to the group’s vice-chairman, Bart Johnson, and help him take over running the organization. Guards immediately moved him into solitary confinement, a policy the Alabama Department of Corrections adopted for prisoners with execution dates, and he can no longer attend the group’s meetings.
I remained in contact with Boyd after I initially spoke with him in 2018, and over the years he told me about the work he’d been doing with Project Hope, like conducting a study on racial disparities in Alabama’s death row population. He told me that he’d been involved with drugs back in Anniston and had his problems with the cops, but wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death.
In April 2019, Boyd told me that he’d been voted as chairman of Project Hope. It was a cause for celebration, and also an omen: Other members had said that the higher someone advances within the group, the closer they are to death.
Johnson told me that Boyd, who goes by “Ant”, is now “family” to him. “When difficulty arises, I always know he’s got my back,” Johnson said. “And he very much looks out for all of us here as the elder statesman who cares about and for his brothers.”
Esther Brown, Project Hope’s executive director and the only free person in the organization, told me that Boyd “has always taken care of others,” and recounted how he once helped get a prisoner moved to a different cell after he was having problems with people around him. Brown called him “the most effective chairman.”
“People know that he gives a damn about them,” she said.
Brown has protested Boyd’s pending execution since the state set a date this summer, attending demonstrations and a press conference, as well as sending out emails detailing problems with Boyd’s case to raise to Governor Kay Ivey, who will decide whether to grant Boyd clemency.
With each execution, Project Hope organizes a vigil where the men on death row dress in the formal white uniforms they typically wear when they have visitors and share memories of the person who is going to be executed.
Brown has gone through the executions of past Project Hope chairmen before: Brian Baldwin in 1999 and Darrell Grayson in 2007. Both had obtained evidence showing they were likely innocent. She was reticent about discussing the possibility that Boyd could be executed.
“How does one deal with things, you know?” she told me. “The thing is, we’re family. It sounds kind of strange or weird, but that is what we are.”
‘There is no justice system in the state of Alabama’
When I reached Rod Giddens, the lawyer who represented Cox at the time of Boyd’s trial, he was surprised to hear that Cox had gotten out of prison in 2009. Giddens told me that making a deal with prosecutors “was the right thing to do at the time,” and said he believed Cox had an “obligation” to tell police and prosecutors what he saw. “It certainly paid off for Cox when you’re comparing his outcome to the others,” he said. “It is striking.”
When I pointed out that the only evidence of what happened in the ballfields that weekend came from Cox, Giddens responded that prosecutors must have had more to go on. “There had to be some other evidence, because you can’t convict somebody solely on the base testimony of a co-defendant,” he said. “I just don’t remember.”
Cox declined to talk when I reached out to him for this story, telling me via text message, “Tell it like you want to tell it!”
With Boyd’s execution approaching, activists have been working to raise awareness about his case. Last month, the anti-death penalty organization, Execution Intervention Project, unveiled a billboard in Montgomery with the message, “Save Anthony Boyd.” They’ve put up an additional billboard in Talladega.

Despite his isolation, Boyd told me he spends his days as he has for the last 30 years: tackling tasks for Project Hope, working on his case, and talking and laughing with friends who stop by his cell. “This doesn’t change who I am,” he said. “This is something I’m going through.”
He said he hasn’t prepared himself for the possibility of dying by being suffocated with nitrogen gas. “There’s nothing you can do to prepare for something like that,” he said. “You can’t prepare a person for drowning.”
Boyd continues to profess his innocence and insists he wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death. “It’s easy to paint a picture when you got the paint brush in your hands,” he said of the prosecution’s case. “They painted the picture they wanted to paint.”
Though his family visits him at Holman, incarceration has taken a toll. His children have grown up, grandchildren have been born, and his father, grandmother, and great-grandmother have died while he’s been on death row. His execution is scheduled on his daughter’s birthday.
“There is no justice system in the state of Alabama,” he said. “There’s a lot of tyranny, a lot of oppression, a lot of racial profiling, racial discrimination and a lot of underhanded tricks to get what they want. What they have is a politicized injustice system.”
Last week, Boyd penned a letter for the latest edition of Project Hope’s newsletter. “This article has been a long time in the making,” he wrote. “I would love to tell all of you that I believe truth, justicе, and human dignity will prevail, but we’re in Alabama where such things are few and far between.”
Maurice Boyd said he doesn’t plan to witness his brother’s execution, should it happen. “I don’t think I can handle it,” he told me.
“We have an innocent man who has spent the majority of his life behind bars,” Maurice said. “The fight is not over and we’re gonna do everything we can to stop this and hopefully get him home.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Anthony-Boyd-for-Oct-19-2025-story-1024x778.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s race for its lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives got a little more crowded last month with the entrance of state Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Madison Republican. The seat will be up for grabs next year because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In making his announcement, Crabtree let people know, in no uncertain terms, that he will be loyal to President Donald Trump. Whether that kind of blind loyalty can get him elected remains to be seen.
“I am the only conservative Republican in the race who has always delivered on an ‘America First,’ ‘South Dakota Always’ agenda,” Crabtree said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “He needs strong allies like myself who will be serving in Congress to make sure he can deliver the America First agenda.”
State senator from Madison formally launches congressional bid, pledges to be Trump ally

In the interview, Crabtree went so far as to back Trump’s tariff policy as well as his handling of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. There are plenty of photos of Trump with his arms wrapped around an American flag. If Trump were a flag, it would be wrapped around Crabtree.
Like the Lloyd Bridges character in the movie “Airplane,” who picked a bad day to give up smoking, Crabtree may have picked a bad year to run for Congress. That’s particularly true if he is going to market himself as a Trump loyalist.
Off-year elections are traditionally tough on the party in power. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the GOP can expect to take a few hits in the 2026 election.
Something must be up, because South Dakota’s usually candidate-averse Democratic Party already has two announced candidates for the party’s nomination for the U.S. House with another who has filed the paperwork to run. It’s hard to imagine a Democrat getting elected to the U.S. House in South Dakota, but that level of Democratic interest is unprecedented in recent history.
By wrapping himself in Trump, Crabtree is betting that the president’s popularity in South Dakota will help him win a primary against another declared GOP candidate, Attorney General Marty Jackley (a third Republican, James Bialota, of Piedmont, has filed paperwork to run). Crabtree is likely to find that service in the Legislature doesn’t necessarily transform into recognition from the electorate.

In an April poll about gubernatorial hopefuls by South Dakota News Watch, state Rep. Jon Hansen, the only announced Republican candidate at the time, was at the bottom with 2% support from registered Republican voters, despite being the current speaker of the state House. That means Crabtree, a former legislative leader, has his work cut out for him. That’s especially true running against Jackley, a veteran of multiple statewide campaigns.
How Crabtree got to be a “former” majority leader in the Senate may also point to a weakness in his candidacy. He was on the wrong side of the carbon dioxide pipeline law that voters rejected in the 2024 general election. Voter opposition to that law contributed to losses by 14 incumbent Republican legislators in the 2024 primary, and also contributed to the Legislature’s adoption of a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines earlier this year.
Crabtree easily handled “election integrity” advocate Rick Weible in their primary, earning 72% of the vote, and was unopposed in the general election.
But Crabtree was ousted from his post as Senate majority leader last winter when Republican legislators gathered to elect their leadership, and the populist branch of the party is known for having a long memory and a love of primaries. That means a populist candidate for the U.S. House could still emerge and put Crabtree’s cloak of Trump loyalty to the test.

Vermont is in some ways a microcosm of the challenges states across the country are facing when it comes to health care, says political scientist Alex Garlick. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  UVM professor finds link between state-level lobbyists and rising health care costs.","The small scale of Vermont’s population and economy, as well as its aging population, are part of why the state sees such high costs to health care, said UVM political science professor Alex Garlick, in light of the publication of his new book.

In his new book on the role of lobbying in shaping health care policy, University of Vermont political science professor Alex Garlick opens with a scene from his days on Capitol Hill. 
Garlick worked as a congressional staffer for Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., during the intense debates over the 2017 Republican effort to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and he describes the scene just after the failed repeal vote — by a single thumbs-down vote from late Arizona Sen. John McCain — when he saw then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., kick off her shoes and leap for joy on the Capitol lawn.
Eight years later, the publication of “Pre-Existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive” comes as Congress is engaged in another battle royale with the same law at its core. Senate Democrats — including Vermont Sens. Peter Welch, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent —  are pushing for the continuation of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in exchange for their votes on a continuing funding resolution that would end the federal government shutdown, now in its third week.
That the continuation of an existing tax credit program for purchasing private insurance is what Democrats are demanding speaks volumes about the influence that industry lobbying has in curbing big health care cost reforms, Garlick said. 
“I think one of the ways you really see the power of the industry is what kind of reform ideas that people will talk about,” he said in an interview on Oct. 10.
Specifically, he said, the tax credits make health insurance more affordable, not the health care itself. As Garlick sees it, the Affordable Care Act, by providing subsidies for the purchase of private insurance, is a more conservative approach to universal health care. 
The cost of health care — to an insurer — ultimately is an issue of supply and demand, Garlick explained. The most effective way to contain costs of care itself is to address those issues systemically. 
Structural Power in Vermont 
In Vermont, the most salient variable in this supply and demand equation is the scale, Garlick said. Namely, the state has a small population, a small economy, one main hospital network and one main in-state insurer. 
“There’s not big competition there, there’s not really any forces trying to push costs downward,” he said.
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick develops the idea of “structural power,” explaining the outsized influence large players in a state economy can have on policy. In Vermont, Garlick sees UVM Health Network wielding this kind of structural power, he elaborated in an interview: For instance, in 2024, when the Green Mountain Care Board, a key state health care regulator, set a lower budget than what UVM had proposed, the hospital cut services.
“It probably reminded the care board that they can’t go too far and too fast. They need to tread carefully about how to rein costs in,” Garlick said.
He believes that having a powerful regulator like the Green Mountain Care Board is an important step toward curbing health care costs. “That said,” Garlick added, “limiting marginal growth year over year doesn’t make care more affordable. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube of how costs have gotten high in the first place.” 
How, then, to actually reduce health care costs?  “One way to push back on the structural power of institutions like the UVM Health network is to not rely on them so much,” Garlick said. 
“The legislature could be more proactive about trying to increase the supply of hospitals that exist.”
Garlick also pointed to the $50 billion allocated in the budget reconciliation law Congress passed this summer for “rural health transformation.” He expects Vermont to be well positioned to receive funding through the program. The state is already working on its application for the fund.
Expanding the number of clinics and hospitals, he says, is just one potential way to add more leeway in that supply-demand equation. 
The state would also be well served by thinking more holistically about how the rural health funds can support the health care system, Garlick said. For example, expanding housing options for hospital workers as a key way to ultimately invest in the long-term economic health of the state’s health care system. 
“When it comes to zoning and housing supply, Vermont is coming from a pretty restrictive place. It is difficult to build and difficult for people to find housing,” Garlick said. “When it comes to medical and hospital employees, their inability to find housing is making it difficult for (hospitals) to attract and retain staff.”
It can lead locally trained doctors and nurses to look outside the state for employment and the hospitals to pay high wages for traveling nurses, he added.
Informational Bottlenecks 
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick also describes another type of leverage that industry can hold via its control of information. In health policy, especially, equal access to information is particularly challenging, he writes. Often people need medical training to really grasp what is medically necessary, privacy concerns keep many details and statistics protected, and a third-party insurance company can obscure the true cost of services.  
Vermont has relatively open access to information through the Green Mountain Care Board. Annually, the board collects financial data from hospitals and insurers, which it makes public. 
Still, the citizen state Legislature’s capacity to digest that information and act on these complex issues during the short legislative session is itself a type of informational bottleneck, Garlick says. 
“When (lawmakers) lack information, when they lack capacity, that builds a dependence on lobbyists and on the industry to help them make the decisions,” Garlick said. “When you’re depending on information from the industry. It’s hard to expect the industry to issue the recommendations that are going to reduce their own revenues.” 
In his book, Garlick calculates that the state legislatures with the highest presence of lobbyists end up spending the least amount of attention on health care in the agenda and see more expensive health care costs.
Each individual lobbyist in a state ends up costing people roughly $7 per capita in additional health care costs, his research suggests. 
The constraints on setting policy in Vermont, though, are often as much about process constraints, Garlick said. “Because the legislative session is not very long, we have these impasses that develop,” he said. “There are capacity issues of ‘Can we even do this ourselves?’”
Counterintuitively, perhaps, the fact that the cost of health care in Vermont, and in the country, has gotten so unwieldy has made him more optimistic that it will bring a desire for broader systemic change. 
One tool Garlick sees as having potential for creating change is the regional state coalitions emerging as an alternative to confusing — or absent — guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“That type of outside the box thinking is probably something that’s going to be necessary, at least in the near future,” he said. “If a state like Vermont feels like a David versus Goliath taking on some of these well-moneyed interests in the health care industry, states should be working together to solve these issues.” 
Still Garlick also believes that state governments ultimately do have the ability to address the high cost of health care close to home, and that individual voters are capable of demanding more from their state legislatures to tackle these issues more broadly, boldly and holistically. 
“Yes, health care is affected by big, national forces but you also consume health care in a state health care market,” Garlick said. “Don’t overlook what happens at the states’ (level). That is the venue where a lot of key decisions about the health care that Vermonters will actually consume are made.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)Republican leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly have made their priorities crystal clear, and the people of this state aren’t one of them. Instead of passing a state budget, repairing our mass teacher shortage, investing in schools, or fixing our crumbling infrastructure, Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall have announced plans to redraw our congressional districts yet again, this time to help Donald Trump rig the 2026 midterm elections.
It’s a shameful, cynical move that would hand nearly 80% of North Carolina’s congressional seats to Republicans in what is, by every measure, a 50/50 swing state. Under Trump’s direction, GOP leaders are taking a page from Texas’ gerrymandering playbook, aiming to impose an 11-3 map that silences voters and stacks the deck for partisan power.    
This is truly unprecedented
Under the Rucho decision, the U.S. Supreme Court was not considering whether states could redraw maps purely for partisan gain. Normally, districts are redrawn in only two situations: after the census to rebalance populations and uphold the 14th Amendment’s “one person, one vote” principle, or when a court orders changes to fix legal violations.
What’s happening now is neither. Legislative leaders have openly admitted that this redraw isn’t about population balance; it’s about removing voters in North Carolina’s Black Belt to engineer partisan advantage. This is retaliation against voters for how they voted, a deliberate effort to silence communities of color and predetermine outcomes in Congress.
We’ve now seen four congressional map changes in just five years: 2021, 2022, 2024, and now 2025. That’s chaos. If this pattern continues, North Carolinians will live under new maps every election cycle, punished again and again for exercising their right to vote.
Targeting Black voters again
The proposed gerrymanders are not just partisan; they may be racially discriminatory. The target is North Carolina’s historic Black Belt district, Congressional District 1 (CD1). For decades, CD1 has been a vital voice for Black voters across northeastern North Carolina, reflecting our state’s long struggle toward equal representation.
Now, in an effort to rig until red, Senator Berger and Speaker Hall are working to rip that district apart. It’s a direct attack on the political power of Black North Carolinians and a slap in the face to every voter who believes elections should be fair and free.
This is not a democracy. It’s manipulation, plain and simple.
Trump’s priorities, not North Carolina’s
At a time when working families are struggling with high costs, teacher shortages, and crumbling public services, politicians in Raleigh are spending their time on backroom map-drawing. Why? To curry favor with Trump and secure partisan control, not to solve the problems that matter most to the people they represent.
North Carolinians deserve leaders who put our communities first, not a president’s political ambitions.
The people are watching, and they’ve had enough
Voters across North Carolina, Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike, are fed up with gerrymandering. A recent poll found that 84% of voters believe it’s never acceptable for politicians to draw districts to help their own party win more seats, including 78% of Republicans, 87% of Democrats, and 85% of unaffiliated voters.
Our message to Raleigh and Washington couldn’t be clearer: these maps don’t belong to politicians. They belong to the people of North Carolina.
The path forward: fair maps for a fair democracy
Every time politicians rig the maps, they rob North Carolinians of real choices and accountability. Our democracy can’t function when election outcomes are pre-determined by partisan cartography. The only way to end these rigged maps for good is through real reform, independent redistricting commissions to take power out of politicians’ hands, and proportional representation to ensure every voter’s voice truly counts. Fair maps should never depend on who happens to hold power this decade.”

That should not be a surprise since Mississippi has the highest percentage of Black people of any state in the nation.
Despite Missisisppi’s large Black population, without the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the number of African Americans serving in the Mississippi Legislature would be far fewer than it is now. There is no disputing the fact that the Voting Rights Act has resulted in more Black people serving in the Mississippi Legislature and indeed in every level of government in the state – from the local to the national level.
Even with the Voting Rights Act, the number of majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature – about 34% of the 174 seats – is less than the percentage of Black people in Mississippi’s total population – about 38%.
Before the Voting Rights Act, there were no elected Black officials in Mississippi during the 20th century except for those in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou. 
This past week, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the section of the Voting Rights Act that ensures a certain level of minority representation in the drawing of political boundaries, such as for state legislative seats, city council seats and U.S. House seats, should be repealed.
Louisiana, which was forced by the courts to draw a second majority-Black congressional district this decade to meet the requirements of the Voting Rights Act, argued before the court that race should not be a factor in redistricting. Louisiana was assisted by President Donald Trump’s administration in its arguments.
The case before the Supreme Court is a big deal. A decision by the court to gut the Voting Rights Act could provide a monumental boost to the desperate and unprecedented efforts of the Trump administration to convince some states to redraw their congressional districts to provide Republicans more safe seats before the 2026 midterm elections. The effort is part of a strategy by Trump to hold onto the small Republican majority in the U.S. House.
It appears some members of the Supreme Court – perhaps a majority – believe that the protections from racial discrimination provided by the Voting Rights are no longer needed. The nation has moved beyond that, they argue.
No doubt, there has been substantial progress made toward halting racial discrimination since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.
But it is worth remembering that in the 2010s, provisions of the Voting Rights Act were used to successfully argue a Mississippi Senate seat that covered 102 miles in various nonsensical directions on the fringes of the Delta was drawn to dilute the Black vote while protecting a white incumbent. Or more recently, the principles of the Voting Rights Act were followed to create three additional majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature.
And it is worth pointing out that state Auditor Shad White, a Republican who aspires to be Mississippi’s next governor, took to social media  to celebrate the possibility of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. 
“I hope they will rule that the kind (of) gerrymandering that has protected Bennie Thompson for years is out,” White wrote. “If they do, Mississippi should immediately move to create simple districts that are not gerrymandered to protect Bennie Thompson.”
Thompson, first elected to the U.S. House in 1993, is Mississippi’s lone Black congressman. He has been the only Democrat in the state’s delegation in Washington since early 2011, when 22-year Rep. Gene Taylor left office after losing to a Republican in south Mississippi.
Perhaps Auditor White does not know that Thompson lobbied the Mississippi Legislature to draw his district more compact after the 2020 Census. But the Legislature opted to draw Thompson a sprawling district that extends almost the length of the western side of the state – at least in part to protect Republican congressmen by packing as many Black residents as possible into Thompson’s district and keeping the other three districts whiter.
In a 2018 interview with Mississippi Today, Thompson spoke of the impact of the Voting Rights Act.
As a student at Tougaloo College in the 1960s, he was working in the Delta to help register Black people to vote when he had a conversation with his mother, who said, “You know we don’t vote here in Bolton. It was a shock to me that I was up in Sunflower County helping register Black people to vote and even in my hometown they didn’t enjoy the same luxury.”
Thompson said that his father, an auto mechanic who died in 1964 before passage of the Voting Rights Act, never voted. His mother, a school teacher, did and most likely cast her first vote for her son when he ran and was elected in 1969 to the Board of Aldermen in his hometown of Bolton.
Without the Voting Rights Act, that would not have been possible. And without the Voting Rights Act today, it is safe to assume there would be fewer Black people elected to office, not just in Mississippi but throughout the nation.
Some might say that is a good thing. But is it really?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15182900/AP25288543891896.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Leading 19th-century landscape painter Charles Heyde struggled with financial hardships and personal demons.

The visit was almost more than artist Charles Heyde could have hoped for. One day in the early 1850s, Heyde was called upon at his Brooklyn painting studio by a pair of poets, one in his early 30s, the other in his mid-50s. Heyde must have been particularly excited to meet the older man, William Cullen Bryant.
Though little remembered today, Bryant wrote widely popular poems in which nature often served as a metaphor for spiritual truth. His activism on a range of issues — from opposing slavery to supporting the creation of a large, central park in Manhattan — made him a leading cultural figure in New York City and the nation. 
For a young artist like Heyde (pronounced Hi-dee), the fact that Bryant would take the time to visit his studio, admire his landscape paintings and talk with him, must have felt like a benediction. Perhaps this connection with Bryant was a sign that he too had what it took to be a great artist.
Walt Whitman, right, introduced Charles Heyde to his sister, Hannah, at the Whitman family home in Brooklyn. Charles courted Hannah and the couple soon married and moved to Vermont. Whitman later regretted introducing Heyde to his sister when it became evident that he was abusive to Hannah.

Heyde might have believed this meeting with Bryant would change his life, but it was his connection with the younger poet that proved far more significant. That man’s name was Walt Whitman. Though a virtual unknown at the time, Whitman had recently begun writing some of the poems he would include in “Leaves of Grass,” the poetry collection that would make him a household name. 
Walt liked Heyde enough that he invited him to visit the Whitman homestead. There Heyde met and soon wooed Whitman’s favorite sister, Hannah. The couple married in March 1852. That same year, Charles and Hannah traveled north to Vermont, taking the train to North Dorset.
Like other members of the so-called Hudson River School of landscape painters, Heyde was looking for inspiring views. Named after one of their favorite subjects, the Hudson River School painters were a group of artists who, from roughly 1825 to 1875, strove to depict the natural beauty of their young country. In addition to the Hudson River Valley, many painters made regular pilgrimages to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Perhaps seeking something off the artists’ beaten path, Heyde chose Vermont. He would make the state his principal subject, and soon his home, for the final four decades of his life. In the process, he became one of Vermont’s most prominent landscape painters of the 19th  century, along with James Hope of Castleton.
In a letter, Heyde wrote rapturously of the scenery: “Nothing can exceed the wild, bold, natural beauty of this place at present. The hues are incomparable and the artist who in his studio imagines himself a creator or interpreter of nature and her glorious beauties, he finds himself humbled … a child in power, only possessing wonder, admiration and the conviction of his weakness.”
For the next four years, the Heydes divided their time between Brooklyn and Vermont. Visiting Dorset, Rutland, Arlington and Bellows Falls, Charles painted scenes along the Connecticut River, Saxtons River, the Batten Kill and the Black River. During that time, the Heydes moved from boardinghouse to boardinghouse. While Charles found the work stimulating, Hannah wrote home that she felt lonely and found it difficult to form friendships because of their transient lifestyle. 
In 1856, he and Hannah moved to Vermont permanently. They picked the bustling port community of Burlington, an area ripe with scenery that Heyde would paint again and again — the peaks of Mount Mansfield and Camel’s Hump, as well as Lake Champlain backed by the distant Adirondacks. 
Burlington’s comparatively small population posed a challenge for an artist trying to earn a living. While most Hudson River School painters lived in New York, Boston or Philadelphia, Heyde had chosen a town whose population was less than 8,000 when he and Hannah arrived. The population would peak at about 14,000 during their time there, but that was still a small pool of potential buyers.
Heyde was enterprising, selling paintings directly from his studio and arranging to exhibit his work in downtown storefront windows and hotel lobbies, where they might catch the eye of travelers.
Greenville Benedict, editor of the Burlington Daily Free Press, quickly became an admirer and frequently mentioned Heyde’s paintings in his paper. A typical article from 1858, headlined “A Fine Painting,” informed  “Lovers of art and Vermont scenery” that a Heyde landscape could be viewed at James Brinsmaid’s store on Church Street, but warned that it would only be on display for 10 days. Such notices helped attract Heyde’s main collectors, middle- and upper-class Burlingtonians who wished to show hometown pride in how they decorated their homes.
Heyde soon established a studio at the corner of Maple Street and Water (now Battery) Street, in the Rutland and Burlington Railroad depot. The location was extremely convenient for his painting forays. In preparing for a 2001 retrospective of the artist’s work at the University of Vermont’s Fleming Museum, exhibit co-curator Thomas Pierce scouted nearby locations from which Heyde had painted. He found that many of the spots were near the train tracks, leading Pierce to theorize that Heyde took advantage of the rail lines that were fast expanding in his era. 
In his research, Pierce noted how Heyde must have visited the locations many times. Over the years the painter’s canvases recorded changes to the landscape. Early views of Mount Mansfield from across Browns River in Jericho, which would become a classic Heyde composition, show a line of trees along the water. In later canvases, the trees are gone — possibly the result of flooding, Pierce suggests — and a barn, missing in the early pieces, appears in the midground. In that way, surveying Heyde’s works can feel like watching a time-lapse film of Vermont’s development during the second half of the 19th century. 
Unlike many Hudson River School painters, Heyde didn’t erase all evidence of human habitation. His paintings often show signs of expanding settlement, including tree stumps and dirt roads leading into the wilderness, as well as technological advancements: trains dwarfed by the serene scenery and steamboats set upon a luminous Lake Champlain. His paintings suggest he believed that in Vermont modern innovations and awe-inspiring nature were compatible.
Charles Heyde didn’t shy away from depicting signs of human impacts on nature, like these tree stumps in a cleared field in “Shelburne Point at Sunset,” painted circa 1857. Contributed

Heyde’s paintings still resonate today. As William Lipke, a UVM art professor noted in a 2001 essay, many of the views Heyde chose to depict are relatively unchanged today and are “‘places of delight’ that identify the unique topographical and scenic features of the Champlain Valley.”  
In 1862, Heyde won a prestigious commission from the Vermont Legislature to redesign the state coat of arms. Heyde’s version included symbols from the previous coat of arms: a pine tree, sheaves of wheat and a cow. These he set against a backdrop of mountains clearly identifiable as Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield.
The Heydes finally found a permanent home in 1864 when they purchased a brick house at 21 Pearl Street, right next to Battery Park, which has a spectacular view of Lake Champlain and the distant Adirondacks. 
The tranquil landscapes Heyde depicted contrasted sharply with life at home. In fact, the Heydes’ marriage was an increasingly rocky one. Hannah wrote regularly to her mother and siblings of her husband’s abusive behavior.  “He does not hurt me much when he gets angry,” she had written her mother in 1856, “he threatened to choke me to death(,) he has struck or pushed me about some, once he bit me a little on the shoulder(,) more to hurt(,) tore or ripped the sleeves of my dress that I wore but all that I care nothing at all about, if he would not talk so to me.”
It would have been easier for Hannah if her husband also treated other people this way but, she wrote, “he can leave my room with the most horrid mouth and be as pleasant as any one you ever saw to any one he meets.”
The Whitmans would sometimes mail Hannah books, or money when the Heydes ran into financial trouble, which she said “Charlie,” as she called her husband, would sometimes take. Heyde made a habit of reading the letters Hannah exchanged with her family.
For his part, Heyde complained about Hannah, or “Han,” as he referred to her, in letters to her family. Writing to Mrs. Whitman and to Walt, who he addressed as “Brother Walter,” Heyde called Hannah lazy and neglectful of her housework; said she often took to her bed, saying she was ill; claimed she would noisily interrupt him in his home studio and rifle through his things; and was suspicious when he returned from outings, sniffing his coat, gloves and handkerchief, accusing him of having an affair.
The Whitmans fully supported Hannah and helped her the best they could. But they lacked the financial resources to extract her from her apparently abusive marriage. If Hannah wanted to leave Charles, she would have found it challenging; married women had few legal rights. Walt Whitman clearly regretted introducing his sister to this man who he now called “a damned lazy scoundrel.”
Meanwhile during this time, Heyde faced a serious professional challenge. The new field of photography was muscling in on the turf that had been painters’ sole domain. 
“Because he was up against photography as competition he had to keep his paintings at a price that was affordable,” explained Pierce. As a result, critics say that Heyde’s later works don’t measure up to his earlier ones. “He couldn’t spend a week doing a painting anymore,” Pierce said, “he had to spend two days, because the more you work it, the more expensive it becomes.”
Some also claim that Heyde’s work started to suffer because he was drinking too much and showing signs of dementia. Pierce thinks that’s not accurate. He pointed to a set of four paintings that recently came up for auction. They are fine examples of the artist’s skill, even though they were painted in the 1880s, late in his career. Heyde hadn’t lost his touch, said Pierce, who suspects the paintings were well-paid commissions, so he didn’t have to rush them.

The only known surviving portrait of Heyde is an etching that appeared as part of a newspaper advertisement for a patent medicine in spring 1892. In the ad, Heyde and a half dozen other prominent Vermonters offered testimonials about the virtues of Paine’s Celery Compound, which had been devised by Windsor druggist Milton K. Paine and was manufactured and sold nationally by a Burlington company. The product claimed to cure a variety of ills, including neuralgia, dyspepsia, constipation and biliousness, as well as liver and kidney ailments.
“I avail myself of the privilege of thanking you — sincerely — for the refreshing sleep I have enjoyed through the efficacy of Paine’s Celery Compound,” Heyde said in the ad. 
(The product’s ingredients included celery and coriander seed, orange and lemon peel, hydrochloric acid, glycerin and simple syrup. An analysis of the compound after passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 revealed that it was also about 20% alcohol.)
Heyde was diagnosed with chronic dementia and admitted to the Vermont State Asylum in Waterbury, where he died on Nov. 3, 1892. He is buried a short distance from the home he shared with Hannah, in Burlington’s Lakeview Cemetery.
Hannah remained in their Pearl Street home for the rest of her life. After she died in 1908, her body was transported back to Brooklyn for burial. The Heydes’ home stood until 1968, when it was demolished as part of an urban renewal project. St. Paul’s Cathedral now stands at the site.
Of course, artists’ work outlives them. 
Like many Charles Heyde paintings, “Lake Champlain and Rock Point,” painted in 1858, is owned by a Burlington-area family. Contributed
The Fleming Museum staged its first Heyde retrospective in 1965, three-quarters of a century after the artist’s death. At the time, 80 paintings were known to exist. For the 2001 show, Pierce and his co-curator Eleazer Durfee tracked down another 74 paintings. Although they found Heyde paintings as far away as Alaska, most had never left the area. They had been passed down through families. Some hung over fireplaces, while a few had been stored and forgotten in attics.
In the quarter century since that show, Pierce received numerous tips about other Heydes held in private collections or being offered for sale. Pierce meticulously logs each newly discovered piece in a digital catalogue he created. By his count, Heydes’ known surviving works now number 226. 
Among the more unusual paintings Pierce has discovered are four from the early 1850s, before the painter had ever visited Vermont. They feature views of New York’s Hudson River. “So now,” said Pierce, “our Hudson River painter has a Hudson River painting.”

Recreationists exploring the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail could be forgiven for bypassing Wolcott, but there’ll soon be no excuse.
There’s a one-room library, an inviting gazebo and parking lot at the trailhead on School Street, but without public bathrooms or much indoor space, the area serves as more of a launch pad for the trail than a destination for people using it.
With 20,253 users in the second half of 2024 and 15,699 in the first half of 2025, Wolcott is the fourth most popular town on the trail, just behind Cambridge and Johnson, despite having a fraction of the accommodations as those towns. The Wolcott Store is half a mile away, over a one-way bridge and along Route 15 with its narrow shoulder.

But for eastbound travelers, some say the best of the rail trail starts in Wolcott. From the parking lot on School Street, riders, runners and walkers typically hang a left toward Hardwick — over the Fisher Bridge, the last covered train bridge to operate in Vermont, and along the Lamoille River to the front gates of the Northeast Kingdom, right now dipped in gold and red for a few more short days.
The stretch of rail trail from Wolcott to Hardwick is one of Michelle Gudorf’s favorite sections, and it’s definitely her husband’s. They live in Wolcott, but they’ve walked the entire length of the rail trail in chunks since it opened last year, and still their home section stands out.
As a resident who works at the town offices just steps away from the rail trail, Michelle is happy to live and work so close to such a beautiful part of the trail. Not everyone is so lucky, and for those who travel to Wolcott to hop on the rail trail, there hasn’t been much of a reason to hang around, post-adventure. But that’s all changing.
For starters, Wolcott is boosting its curb appeal and creating a clear connection to the trail. In addition to clearing overgrown trees and vegetation and planting a new kiosk with fresh maps along the trail, the town received a grant to resurrect the old train depot foundation at the intersection of the rail trail and the connector trail.
When the railroad was operational, the current library operated as a depot on the foundation. The building was later relocated to serve a more useful purpose as a library a few hundred yards away, but the foundation still stands beneath long grass and short trees.
Utilizing a grant, the town has plans to cut back the vegetation and fill the foundation with gravel to create a rest area with picnic tables and two giant outdoor planters, which were hand-painted at a community event. The new kiosk will also have historical information about the depot and its relocation.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
On the other end of the connector path, the rail trail has helped justify some major community upgrades in Wolcott.
Different town entities are developing a plan to renovate the old schoolhouse on School Street, which is connected to the town offices, and move the library next door into the renovated schoolhouse. The current library would then be leased as a café or restaurant with ice cream, accommodating residents of Wolcott and trail users alike.
A coinciding effort to build a decentralized wastewater system in Wolcott — the first of its kind for the town — would also mean public toilets and running water at the trailhead.
Although the area is removed from businesses on Route 15 in Wolcott, the nexus of the rail trail, library, town offices and a new business would create an important community hub, according to Linda Martin, Wolcott selectboard chair.
“There’s been a lot of interest for years to see something done with the old schoolhouse,” Martin said, saying rail trail momentum has helped the town bring those desires to fruition.
Trust in Wolcott
Reigniting an old effort, a few townspeople earlier this year established the Wolcott Community Trust and began fundraising to pay for the schoolhouse renovation. The project is expected to cost $1 million, and the trust has secured $300,000 through a Village Trust Initiative grant, which should cover the planning and early-construction phases, Martin said, adding she’s confident in various fundraising efforts for the remainder of the cost. In most of those grant applications, the rail trail is listed as a burgeoning community asset.
“We’ve got these big goals we’re working towards as a town, and the rail trail has opened up some good opportunities,” Martin said.
The trust initially considered opening the café in the old schoolhouse, but the library could use more space, and its current building fits an intimate café setting, Martin added.

For gas station purchases, used books, cannabis and smoked fish — all nearby on Route 15 in Wolcott — a renovation to the bridge on School Street will create a safer path to and from the rail trail.
The bridge will be closed from March to September next summer. It will have a pedestrian walkway when it opens again, replacing the current right of way that’s barely large enough for one vehicle.
The bridge has sustained damage over years of floods. It’s been stabilized but needs a permanent fix. Because the town opted to close the bridge during construction, and not build a temporary bridge, the state is covering the cost of the project, save for initial, planning costs of around $80,000, Martin said.

We need a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones of our communities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Drew Simmons: It’s time to invest in Vermont’s outdoor businesses.","This commentary is by Drew Simmons, of Waitsfield. He is the president of Pale Morning Media, a public relations and strategic communications agency specializing in the outdoor world. He is a board member of the Vermont Outdoor Business Alliance and a founding steering committee member of the Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative.


​​In late May, as the first wave of tariff impacts seeped into the outdoor industry, The New York Times profiled two Vermont business owners, Carina Hamel and Robby Ringer of BIVO, who detailed how the erratic and weighty new tariffs had fundamentally changed the math of their business. 
“I still feel super optimistic we can make it through this,” said Hamel, explaining how she could only afford 8,000 of 30,000 bottles in an incoming order because of the tariffs. “But I think it’s going to be really freaking hard.”
Tariffs are fees charged to manufacturers the moment a product arrives in the United States. When tariff levels go up or go down, so does the amount of fees charged on arriving shipments. Like a pebble thrown in a pond, every tariff adjustment has a ripple effect, adding a fresh layer of complexity for the manufacturer. 
When dozens of pebbles are thrown? The overlapping ripples can make planning for the most basic business efforts a daunting task. 
Early on, outdoor gearmakers absorbed the new fees in hopes they would vanish by mid-summer. Yet as tariffs have risen and fallen (and risen again), gearmakers understandably began adjusting prices and passing along some of the new costs to their retailers. But along with passed-down costs has come a passed-down dilemma: Raise prices and risk losing customers? Or hold the line and risk losing your business?
Caleb Magoon, owner of Waterbury Sports, recently told me about “nearly daily updates” on price changes, speculations on price changes and changes to existing changes. He likened it to “whack-a-mole” and expressed how huge the challenge has been. Jen Roberts, co-owner of Onion River Outdoors, got more specific with me about the impacts of these retroactive price changes: “Will we trim our fall orders and carry less to meet our budget? If so, will our sales decrease and threaten a death spiral? Will we pass on the price increases in whole or in part to our customers?”
In Vermont, outdoor recreation delivers $2.1 billion of annual economic impact, and retailers make up around 20% of that total number. They hire your family, your friends, your neighbors. They fix your flat tires and give friendly tips on the best place to see peak foliage. They pay local taxes that support local things, and they regularly donate far beyond what’s owed to their communities. 
According to Grassroots Outdoor Alliance, a national organization of independent specialty retailers, 95% of stores give back at least 1% in gross sales to their community, and more than half give back at least 2%.
“People say there are only two expenses you can realistically control in a retail business: inventory and payroll,” Roberts said. “I guess I’m seeing that in action now. With inventory prices going up dramatically due to the tariffs, we have no choice but to cut our payroll expenses. I can’t stomach lowering anyone’s already meager wages or even freezing them at their current level, so we are going to get by with fewer staff.”
Retailers are a resilient bunch, as they’ve endured plenty of uncertainty in the past from rainy summers to Covid-19 shutdowns. But those previous challenges were always external, not eating away at profitability from the inside. They also have not happened during a time of rising inflation and historic drop-off in Canadian visitors. 
The hard truth is that Vermont is not going to be able to bake sale its way out of this. It’s time to do more than make an occasional, feel-good purchase at a local store, and it’s time for a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones. Who owns a business matters just as much as what that business sells, that money capable of building a future for the local community. 
“People appreciate having local businesses, and for many, I suspect this makes up part of why they live in Vermont,” said Hal Ellms of Pinnacle Outdoor Group, an outdoor industry sales representative who works directly with outdoor retailers throughout Vermont and the region. “But they buy their bikes, shoes, clothing, skis and more from online businesses based thousands of miles away. It’s as if they don’t make the connection between their definition of local Vermont and what their actual actions are.”
This month, Vermont retailers are once again stocking cozy sweaters, hiking boots and wool socks for the fall season; for locals and visitors, it’s a scene as predictable as the changing of the leaves. But as predictability went out the window months ago for those behind the cash register, it is on us to provide some stability of our own. 
We need to think about our dollars in the same way independent retailers do — as money from today that goes toward building the realities of tomorrow. 
These are not just purchases, but investments — investments that fill the shelves for next winter and spring, that build our roads and trails and schools and that support the people and places we need. Because without those investments, that future is in doubt.

Now he sets out just a couple dozen traps, out of curiosity — or force of habit — and he’s lucky to catch 10 lobsters.
“I’ve been doing it all my life. I gotta see for myself,” he said. “But as far as trying to make a living, you can’t do it, not any more.”
Mansi converted his lobster wholesale facility on the dock in Guilford into a restaurant in the early 2000s. In the upstairs office on a sunny September morning, there are a few reminders of the life he used to lead: a “Captain’s Quarters” sign, framed photos from his lobstering heyday, the mast of his son’s fishing boat swaying gently out the window. 
His eyes lit up as he recalled the good days. “We saw a lot of lobsters, a real lot of lobsters,” Mansi said.

In the 1980s and ’90s, Mansi was making a killing, along with the roughly 1,200 commercial lobstermen on Long Island Sound. The Sound was the third most-productive lobster fishery in the country, with 10 million pounds of lobster landings at its peak in 1998, including 3.8 million pounds in Connecticut.
But in the fall of 1999, lobstermen pulled up traps filled with limp, sickly lobsters, and soon after, hardly any lobsters at all. It was an unprecedented mortality event, and the lobster population never recovered. Connecticut saw only 181,000 pounds of lobster landings in 2024, less than 5% of the 1998 peak. Now most seafood restaurants in the state — including Mansi’s — import lobster from Maine or Canada.
The catastrophic die-off is still an emotional subject for Mansi and so many former lobstermen. In addition to the painful memory of losing their livelihoods practically overnight, resentment lingers about how it happened. The scientific consensus is that warming waters, and an epidemic of a crustacean disease called paramoebiasis, were the primary culprits — and that pesticides used to combat West Nile virus may have had an additional effect.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
But the catastrophe was complex and unprecedented, and not all scientists agree on which factors were the most significant. The lobstermen almost unanimously blame the pesticides, and they feel betrayed by the chemical manufacturers, the marine scientists, and the government — whose tightening regulations they resented and whose financial assistance they found inadequate. 
In the early 2000s, as they fought for accountability and answers, the lobstermen had no choice but to adapt to the new reality. Some switched to fishing, clamming or catching conch, but most sold their boats and left the fishing docks behind entirely. 
Now there are no full-time commercial lobstermen left in Connecticut.
But there are still a few part-timers. In the southeasternmost corner of the state, the Stonington port is home to seven active lobster boats. Other than one boat in New London, Stonington is the last bastion of commercial lobstering in Connecticut. Roddy Grimshaw is one of the few in Stonington still at it, a man of 29 who goes lobstering with his dad and a small crew a few days a week.
It’s not just lobstering that’s in decline — all forms of commercial fishing are under threat as luxury development supplants the docks once home to a vibrant blue-collar fishing culture. 
Grimshaw put it this way: “The way I see it, if we don’t stay active … this will become just another yacht club.”

The heyday
Mansi has fond memories of fishing with his family as a kid growing up in East Haven in the late 1960s.
“I just loved being out on the water, the freedom,” he said. At that time, the Connecticut lobster industry was picking up steam after a decades-long lull around the turn of the century. His dad wasn’t a lobsterman, more of a recreational fisherman, but, eyeing the hauls of lobstermen down at the docks, he decided to give it a shot. He started working on a friend’s father’s lobster boat while he was in high school in the 1970s. Then, in 1983, he bought his own boat, the Jani M.— named after his wife — and went into business for himself. And business was good.
“When you left the dock, you knew you were gonna catch lobsters. It was exciting. You’re dying to pull that first trap to see what was in it. And, you know, they were almost always full,” he said.
In the ’80s and ’90s, Mansi was landing up to 100,000 pounds per year on just his boat, over 50% of the state’s entire 2024 haul. At a market price of $3 per pound, he was making a killing. He also started the Guilford Lobster Pound, a wholesaler that bought lobster from other fishermen and sold it to Connecticut retailers and restaurants.

Mansi described a vibrant waterfront community at the Guilford Marina and at fishing docks across the state. He pointed to a newspaper article framed on his wall, which told the story of a fellow Guilford lobsterman who suffered a heart attack. 
“We got six lobstermen all together, and we ended up going out and pulling all his gear. We brought all his lobsters to the pound here, we sold his lobsters, and we gave him a check. We all stuck together,” he said. 
Mansi wasn’t the only one to turn a high school lobstering job into a lucrative career in those years. Some 30 miles down the Sound in Norwalk, Gary Whetmore grew up lobstering with his dad. 
“My father lobstered on a very small scale, and then I got into it on a much bigger scale,” Whetmore said. “I remember swapping lobsters with a gym teacher to get out of classes.”

“It was fun. It wasn’t work. The money was great, but it was the freedom of it. You could make as much or as little as you wanted to make. And if you worked hard enough, you could have anything you want in the world,” he said.
One might think that the accelerating lobster hauls in those days — a roughly six-fold increase in Connecticut from the 1970s to the 1990s — risked depleting the lobster population. Counterintuitively, the reverse was true.
“There were a lot of lobsters,” Whetmore continued, “but it wasn’t natural.” 
Connecticut lobstermen from that era describe their work not as catching lobsters but, rather, “farming”  them. 
“We were feeding them and letting them go,” Whetmore said. Indeed, in the ’80s and ’90s, lobstermen were stuffing millions of pounds of bait fish — pogy, mackerel, and others — into tens of thousands of traps in Long Island Sound. 
The influx of bait represented a huge supplement to the lobsters’ natural food sources, artificially increasing the population to levels never before seen in the Sound. It was great for business, but scientists say the crowded crustacean conditions on the seafloor, combined with the unnaturally young population — lobstermen harvested them as soon as they reached the minimum size required by regulation — likely left them more vulnerable to the disease that decimated the population in the late ’90s. It was the boom before the bust.
“It was not sustainable. Something was going to give,” Whetmore said. “There were no big lobsters here. As soon as they were legal, we harvested them. We’re feeding them, we’re growing them, and we’re harvesting, and whoever worked the hardest harvested the most. And that’s as simple as it was.” 
“It was really, really good, and when it ended, it ended,” Whetmore said.
Mansi spoke of the sudden die-off with a similar sense of finality. “You go out there one day, and that’s it. Overnight, it was done. It was ended,” he said.

The die-off
In the years leading up to the widespread die-off in the fall of 1999, there were early signs of trouble. Two localized lobster mortality events occurred in the western Sound, from Norwalk to Greenwich, in 1997 and 1998.
Whetmore, just a few miles further east, took heed of those early warnings. “I heard about the die-off getting as far up as Greenwich in ’98. And I told my guys that were working for me: If it happens next year, and it comes this way, we’re done. And sure enough, it got here,” he said.
In August 1999, dead lobsters started washing up on beaches along the Sound. On Sept. 16, Tropical Storm Floyd hit the region, dumping up to 12 inches of rain into the Sound in just two days.
By the following week, Long Island Sound’s lobster industry practically collapsed. 
“A week after the storm, when I went out, the lobsters in the pots were nothing but goo. It smelled. It was nothing but lobster parts,” said Tony Carlo, a Darien lobsterman.
The Western Sound was hit the hardest, that fall experiencing a 99% reduction in lobster landings compared to the previous year. Ports in the east of the Sound saw reductions of 64% to 91%.
At first, neither the lobstermen nor marine scientists had a clear understanding of the cause. A New York Times headline on Oct. 18, 1999, read, “Scientists Are Mystified by Deaths Of Lobsters in Long Island.” 
But there was a suspicious coincidence. In August, just a month before the storm, the government began applying pesticides, including resmethrin and methoprene, across Connecticut and New York to curb the spread of West Nile Virus. Because lobsters are related to insects, which the pesticides were designed to kill, many suspected that the runoff from the storm poisoned the lobsters. 
In January 2000, a “commercial fishery failure” was declared in the Sound, and the federal government authorized $13.9 million to provide economic relief for the lobstermen and to fund research into the causes of the disaster. Over 20 research projects across a slew of institutions and agencies were approved. 
When the studies concluded by 2004, a clearer picture emerged. A parasitic amoeba, Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, had infected and killed the lobsters. But it wasn’t just the disease. Researchers referred to a “perfect storm” of contributing factors. Years of above-average water temperatures weakened the immune systems of the lobsters, which are extremely sensitive to temperature increases. The storm may have accelerated the die-off by churning up the waters, bringing warmer temperatures to the already sick lobsters. Furthermore, the unnaturally high and primarily juvenile population was particularly vulnerable to infection.
“When you have a bunch of young animals all together, just like a cold in a classroom at school, the disease spreads through them pretty quickly,” said biologist Nancy Balcom, associate director of Connecticut Sea Grant, who was involved in research after the die-off and published several articles summarizing the findings.
In the decades since 1999, the lobster population would appear to rebound in some years with a new crop of juvenile lobsters. 
“But then a few years later, you didn’t see the adults,” Balcom said. This is consistent with the finding that the water is just getting too warm for the lobsters to tolerate, even though the paramoebiosis epidemic has passed. Long Island Sound has historically been the southernmost tip of the inshore range of the American lobster. With global warming, that map is being redrawn, and their range may soon terminate in Massachusetts.

The pesticides
The role of the pesticides loomed large immediately after the die-off. Toxicology testing and several modeling exercises were conducted, but even the “worst case scenario” model indicated that the concentration of the chemicals never reached lethal levels for the lobsters. The scientific consensus is that the pesticides were not the primary cause of the die-off.
That consensus, however, is not ironclad, and most of the lobstermen don’t buy it.
“The pesticides are what killed them,” Mansi said. “We actually see what’s going on. We were there, and we’re telling you what we saw. They [the scientists] have never been on the water, they just sit in a lab and they make up these models that we have to adhere to.”
The timing of the pesticide application and the storm runoff was uncanny, and the lobstermen observed strange, hyperactive behavior in some living lobsters they caught after the die-off, as well as in certain species of crabs. Mansi helped recruit a biologist the lobstermen considered one of their own, Dr. Robert Bayer of Maine’s Lobster Institute. Bayer came down to Connecticut, performed his own tests, and concluded that the lobsters hauled alive during the 1999 event “showed the behaviors, classic behaviors, of pesticide poisoning — which is hyperactivity.” 
In the months and years that followed, while the government-funded studies were still underway, the lobstermen initiated a class action lawsuit against Cheminova and other pesticide makers, eventually receiving two settlements, for $12.5 million and $3.75 million. The lobstermen see the settlement as a vindication of their hypothesis, while Balcom says the pesticide makers never admitted to causing the die-off and merely settled to make the lawsuit go away. 
“If the pesticides were the primary cause of death, they would have received probably lots more money,” she said.  
Tarsila Seara, a social scientist who studies fishing communities, views the science as less settled, and she understands the animosity Mansi and many other lobstermen still feel towards the biologists, the pesticide companies and the government. In 2019, while a professor at the University of New Haven, she interviewed 20 former lobstermen and published two papers about the social impacts of the die-off.
“There was a dismissal of their experience and the knowledge that the fishermen were trying to bring to the table,” Seara said. “It should have been dealt with differently.”

“The reality is that it was a very complex combination of factors, and the lobstermen really wanted to find the one thing that they could blame, and they were naturally upset because there was no backing of that one culprit,” she said. 
Tony Carlo and Roger Frate, cousins who started lobstering in the 1970s in central Connecticut, were active in the fight against the pesticide companies in the early 2000s. Frate now runs the Darien Seafood Market with Carlo’s help. Alongside tanks with live lobsters (now imported from Maine or Canada), the store has multiple display cases with newspaper articles documenting the die-off and ensuing legal battles. On a warm August afternoon, Carlo wore a red baseball cap with an image of a lobster, and Roger wore a T-shirt with the Darien Seafood Market’s lobster insignia. 
The two cousins are still angry at the chemical makers, politicians and marine scientists they see as responsible for causing — or failing to address — the destruction of their livelihood. 
“We lost everything within a three-week period,” Carlo said.
“We fought in Washington, Hartford, Boston … we fought against some big people at the chemical companies. We kept going for years and years,” Frate said.
Frate and Carlo see the government’s regulatory response in the 2000s — mandating an increase in “gauge” size (a device used to measure the minimum-sized lobsters legal to catch), as well as a 90-day moratorium imposed on lobstering from early September to early December — as harmful and misguided. 
“From beginning to end, it seemed like they were always against us, to slow us down one way or another,” Carlo said.

They argued for years that the real culprit was toxicity from the pesticides, as well as an accumulation of other pollutants from decades of runoff into the Sound. They asked for money to “clean up” the Sound and more financial support for the struggling lobstermen. But their pleas fell on deaf ears. 
Frate and Carlo hold a litany of grudges against the Connecticut and New York politicians of that era. 
“Schumer would never call us back … Blumenthal’s telling lies … Chris Shays, that piece of shit. You got your money. The state got their money. Now the fisheries’ money’s not there,” Frate said. 
Frate and Carlo did eventually collect checks from the pesticide maker settlements. “But it wasn’t about the money,” Carlo said. “We’d give it all back to them if they could give us back Long Island Sound. We want our lobster back.”

A difficult adjustment
Seara, the social scientist, understands the animosity towards the government in the years following the die-off. 
“They were not being supported when they were going through something that was very impactful, very traumatic,” she said. “Some of the programs the government put in place were not well received. They didn’t seem to make sense to a lot of the fishermen.”
Over the years, there were some experiments with lobster trap buyback programs, which paid lobstermen to recover the thousands of abandoned pots littering the seafloor. In September, these programs received a $1.8 million boost of federal funding.
Other programs included various job retraining efforts, which lobstermen like Mansi scoff at to this day.
“They said, ‘We’ll train you.’ Well, there’s no retraining. You don’t take a guy that’s been fishing on the water all his life and retrain him to go work in an office. It’s something that you can’t do,” Mansi said.
What made the prospect of retraining particularly unappealing is that, for so many lobstermen, lobstering is not just a job but a deeply held identity and beloved lifestyle. Seara, along with her mentor, Professor Richard Pollnac, have studied fishing communities across the world, and they’ve found that self-employed fishermen experience some of the highest levels of job satisfaction of any workers. 
“It’s the freedom, being out in the water, being close to nature, and some aspects that are thrilling. It’s a gamble, right? You’re out there, you don’t know what you’re going to get. Every day is different. You have encounters with nature, whales, and beautiful sunsets, and, on top of it, this adventure and this challenge, and this camaraderie,” Seara said. 
“A fisherman once put it to me like this: ‘What other profession in the world do you know that people pay to do over the weekend?’” she said.

Each lobsterman took their own path after the die-off. Some turned to clamming or catching conch, but most couldn’t find a way to support themselves on the water. Many struggled. 
“We had a lot of guys who became alcoholics or drug addicts,” Mansi said. 
“We had to move on,” Mansi said. “I am still bitter about what happened, because not only did they wipe out an industry, they wiped out a way of life,” he said.
Mansi turned his lobster pound on the docks in Guilford into a seasonal restaurant. He considers himself lucky, as he’s still able to work down by the water, and his son runs a fishing boat out of the same port.
Carlo initially got a job doing manual labor down at the docks in Norwalk for $10 an hour, “just to do something and stay near the water,” but it didn’t pay the bills. He was forced to find a new career, so he started a landscaping business, which he still runs. 
“Landscaping, being on land … I hated it. Hated it. I hate it to this day,” Carlo said.
One of the few who seemed to transition smoothly was Whetmore. Immediately after the die-off, he got into marine construction, and he now runs a successful business out of Norwalk, G&C Marine, which primarily builds residential docks. 
Whetmore was included in Seara’s 2019 study; notably, he was the sole lobsterman out of the 20 interviewed who said they believe that warming waters and the disease were to blame for the die-off. Even his own son insists it was the pesticides.
“You can’t argue the numbers. You know, the bottom temperature, it’s there,” Whetmore said. 
He attributes his ability to adapt — and his acceptance of immovable forces like global warming — to a feeling that he is lucky to be alive. In the last two decades, he’s had two kidney transplants, cancer and multiple heart attacks. 
“I’m still here,” he said. “And I think that’s allowed me to bounce back a little bit more than these other guys. Yeah, you lost your lobsters. That’s too bad. Get a life.”

The last lobster fleet
Stonington’s working docks smell like diesel and bait. 
On a sunny September afternoon, a flock of gulls circled the docks as the Lady Lynn cruised into the harbor — 42 feet of scuffed fiberglass, stacked with crusty lobster traps. The Lady Lynn is one of seven lobster boats still operating out of Stonington, the last commercial lobster fleet in Connecticut.
Roddy Grimshaw was on deck with his crew, Ian Crimm and Bubba Dolith, his 10-month-old puppy, Bailey, who ran back and forth excitedly, and his dad, Mike, who bought the Lady Lynn back in the ’70s. They were in a rush to haul out all their traps before Sept. 7, when the season closed for 90 days.
After unloading all the traps into massive stacks on the dock, Grimshaw took a breather. 
“When I’m on the boat, I’m always active, doing something like hauling lobsters, driving the boat, hauling the gear, seeing interesting things. I just, I love it, and I love to tan,” he said, laughing. Grimshaw showed off a new tattoo of a lobster on his very tan forearm.
“It’s been a good year,” he said.

Grimshaw was averaging 160 lobsters (totaling about 200 pounds) each time he pulled traps. Though it’s a far cry from the quadruple digits his dad used to haul back in the ’90s, it’s an improvement from last year. 
“It could last this winter. We could have another great season. But we also could have a really shitty season. Let’s hope,” he said.
It’s not a coincidence that the last remnants of the state’s lobster industry are located in Stonington. Just outside of Long Island Sound, only a few miles from the Rhode Island border, the area has somewhat cooler water, and its fishery wasn’t hit as hard by the die-off in the ’90s. 
These days, Grimshaw lobsters two to three days per week and the rest of the week goes out “dragging” for fish — flounder, whiting, sea bass and others. But lobstering is his true love, and he’d like to dedicate himself to it full-time, though he says the catch is just too variable to rely on. His eyes lit up when he considered the possibility. “It’s a big, big idea, and it would be so great,” he said.
One of his other struggles is fetching a reasonable price for the lobsters he lands. Lobster imported from Maine and Canada for roughly $3 per pound dominate the market, which just isn’t enough to cover his costs. So he sells directly to the public on the docks in addition to selling to wholesalers who are willing to pay about $7 per pound, this year’s going rate for Connecticut lobsters.

His crew members, Crimm, 18 and Dolith, 19, kidded around as they fixed up the engine and organized tools. They’re new to working with Grimshaw, who recently had to replace his entire crew after he discovered that one was drinking on the job, and the other was a registered sex offender.
Crimm and Dolith love the work, even though Grimshaw can give them a hard time. Neither of them has had what they’d consider a “normal” job — they’ve bounced between farming and other forms of manual labor — and they want to keep working on the Lady Lynn as long as there are lobster to be caught. 
“It’s not a normal 9-to-5, which I hate. I can’t do them,” Dolith said while pulling up lobster pots hanging off the side of the Lady Lynn in the harbor.
“I love this. It’s pretty fun shit,” Crimm said while removing and sorting the lobsters. “Who else gets paid to go out on a boat all the time?”
Their boss, Grimshaw, plans to take over his dad’s lobstering license in January. At 29, as the youngest active commercial lobster captain in the state, he’ll represent both the next generation and the last of the line. 
Grimshaw understands the weight of his position.
“There’s not many other people here that does it, that wants to do it,” Grimshaw said. 
He pointed to a seafood restaurant and yacht club visible in the distance. “If this harbor wasn’t here, it wouldn’t make a difference to the tourists and out-of-town people. And I just don’t want to see that,” he said.
“I want to continue,” he said. “I don’t see myself doing something different.”

Whetmore expressed a similar unease with the luxury development and tourism taking over the waterfront that used to be home to so many fishing and working docks. While walking around his construction yard in Norwalk one August afternoon, he pointed to the neighboring lots. 
“There were oil tankers on this river. There were fishermen going down the river. Now it’s condos and rowing clubs. It’s definitely changing. It’s been very gentrified.” 
The Norwalk Planning & Zoning Commission just approved a 59-unit mixed-use complex, with luxury apartments and a boardwalk, on the property adjacent to Whetmore’s construction yard. He said the town government has applied enormous pressure on him to move his business.
In town after town along the Sound, the working waterfront is giving way to luxury housing and recreation. A 2022 mid-Atlantic fisheries briefing flagged “persistent trends toward gentrification of working waterfronts,” noting that the loss of maritime space can upend the cultural identity of fishing communities.
“They don’t want equipment like this. They need us when we build their docks, their yacht clubs, their rowing clubs, and they love us when we’re building them, but they don’t want to see us,” Whetmore said.
“There was a community, a waterfront community, and that’s gone,” he said. “That way of life is gone.”

But now comes Kristi Noem with a 30-second video blaming the current government shutdown on the Democrats, adding an Orwellian overtone to our collective trial by air travel. Many airports — including Eisenhower in Wichita and Kansas City International — have refused to play the video at TSA checkpoints, with most citing policies which forbid the display of political messages.
Other airports, such as Charleston International, are looping the video.
The fact there is any debate over the video is a win for Noem, who directs the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A former governor of South Dakota, Noem transformed herself with a dental upgrade and hair extensions to resemble other women in Trump’s MAGA orbit, and now stars in many of ICE’s action videos of immigration raids.
There’s nothing wrong with dental work and new hair, and a person’s appearance isn’t generally relevant to their job performance. But in Noem’s case, her appearance seems integral to the job. Same with Secretary of Defense (and no, not war) Pete Hegseth. Both had few qualifications and little experience for their cabinet-level jobs, but they look good on camera, in an uncanny valley kind of way.
In other administrations, the Homeland Security secretary would have been broadly mocked and possibly threatened with the Hatch Act for engaging in political activity. But not now.
In the “public service announcement” video, Noem says it is “TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe.”
Then she launches into it.
“However, Democrats in Congress refused to fund the federal government and because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
This is overtly partisan and dead wrong.
The government shutdown, now almost three weeks long, is the result of Congress failing to fund the government. The House has passed a continuing resolution that would provide funding through Nov. 21, but the Senate has failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to approve a temporary spending bill. The sticking point for Democrats is the end of Affordable Care Act tax credits in the Republican spending bill, which would deny tens of millions of Americans health care.
“We will do all we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel,” Noem says in the video. “Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
While Noem’s video has gotten the most attention recently, other agencies are also plunging into partisanship. The official White House website, for example, has an incomprehensible shutdown clock (you’re left guessing whether the digits are days, hours, or seconds) that blames Democrats. Even more disturbing are partisan auto-generated emails sent from the official accounts of furloughed federal workers.
The top-down erosion of neutrality in the U.S. civil service is an alarm bell of a faltering democracy. Instead of serving the people, such partisanship serves the party — or the man — in power. And the Noem TSA video is uncomfortably close to the tactics employed by strongmen through the ages.
It is propaganda.
“Everything melted into the mist,” Winston Smith reflects in “1984,” the dystopian novel to which all other fictional dystopias are compared. “Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing.”
We are not in 1984 yet, but since Trump’s second inauguration nine months ago we have inched ever closer to it. We now have crossed into burgeoning authoritarianism, where the politics of the leader must necessarily be the politics of a formerly nonpartisan civil service.
You can see it in Noem’s tasteless and disingenuous videos and in a hundred other acts committed weekly, from the landing of helicopters on the roofs of apartment buildings to terrorize residents during an ICE raid to the summary execution by government munitions of boats of “narco-terrorists” at sea.
What the Trump administration is offering, with its “war” on presumed drug traffickers, is the kind of violence that once seemed unthinkable for the United States. Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was indicted by the International Criminal Court, and condemned by the United States, for the thousands killed on his orders for suspicion of dealing in narcotics. Now Trump’s administration appears to be practicing the kind of extra-judicial killings that put Duterte in the dock at the Hague.
With domestic immigration enforcement, ordinary residents — especially in Chicago and other blue cities — are being subjected to harassment, interrogation, and arrest by federal agents in tactical gear wearing balaclavas and other coverings to hide their faces. Some of those detained are American citizens, based on no other suspicion than the color of their skin.
George Orwell, who was writing during and after the rise of fascism in Europe, was keenly aware of his moment in time.
“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it,” Orwell wrote shortly after the end of the second world war. “It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.”
It is simply a question, Orwell argues, of which side to take and what approach to follow.
“And the more one is conscious of one’s political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one’s aesthetic and intellectual integrity,” he said.
Any writer of some salt will know what Orwell is talking about.
Put pen to paper or fingers to keys and sooner or later you’ll come to the jarring choice of either to scrub your beliefs from your work or let them inform it. Scrubbing pays better, if the scrub benefits the wealthy and doesn’t anger the powerful, but getting your hands dirty is more satisfying. Well, as long as you don’t write schlock and don’t do violence to fact. This is true for essays and even truer for poetry and fiction, and it helps some of us sleep at night.
What will help me to sleep tonight is describing Noem’s video as propaganda. You may have stumbled a bit the first time I used the word, because of its powerful connotations, but now is the time to use powerful words properly.
The Noem video is party propaganda.
Be troubled that your government has shredded some of the last of the norms that defined American democracy and is now engaged in demonizing the opposition party in official government communication.
And it’s not just the other party that is being labeled as the enemy, it’s anyone who engages in dissent or is part of an imagined left-wing conspiracy. A recent National Security Memorandum, ostensibly to counter political violence, prioritizes investigations of a broad swath of culture, including those who hold beliefs that are “anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity.” Also suspect is “extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”
This executive memorandum, signed shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting, is a blank check for the Trump administration to criminalize free speech it finds irksome. The overly broad language suggests that any opinion that is inconsistent with Trump-defined patriotism and spirituality is synonymous with domestic terror.
Much of what has been discussed here was anticipated by Timothy Snyder’s 2017 book, “On Tyranny.” In it Snyder gives 20 lessons to resist tyranny, and I find myself returning to those lessons as the second Trump era unfolds.
Of particular interest:
Lesson No. 5, Remember Professional Ethics.
“If lawyers had followed the norm of no execution without trial, if doctors had accepted the rule of no surgery without consent, if businessmen had endorsed the prohibition of slavery, if bureaucrats had refused paperwork involving murder, then the Nazi regime would have been much harder pressed to carry out the atrocities by which we remember it.”
The Trump administration is not the Nazi regime, and we do not yet know what it will be remembered for, but the lesson is apt. By insisting on professional ethics, especially the nonpartisan tradition of civil service, we might slow the collapse of democracy. Will we be able to repair the structural damage to the nation? If we don’t, we’ll soon have another, lesser form of government.
A word is in order here about the origins of the word “propaganda,” which did not have its negative connotation until after the death camps and other horrors of World War II were exposed. The Soviet Cold War-era techniques of falsehood and misdirection cemented the modern concept in our minds. But it was the American Edward Bernays, often called the “father of modern public relations,” who advanced the term in his 1928 book.
Previously, the word had been mostly used to describe the propagation of a particular faith, but Bernays introduced us to lessons learned by World War I’s Creel Commission in promoting the war at home and abroad. Later, Bernays helped American tobacco companies sell cigarettes to women (a previously untapped market) and assisted the CIA in overthrowing the democratically-elected government of Guatemala.
“The intelligent and conscious manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society,” Bernays wrote. “Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of this country.”
Despite the bland language, what Bernays suggested in this and other books was a roadmap to manage public opinion on behalf of governments and business. I’ve written about Bernays before, but his theories are inescapable in modern politics. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, he believed it was necessary for public relations to appeal not to the rational mind, but the sometimes dark corners of our unconscious.
Bernays relied on newspapers and radio to spread his messages. Today, the work is increasingly done through videos and social media. The RAND Corp., the public policy thinktank, has given a name to the kind of rapid-fire partial truths and outright deceits pioneered in 2008 by Russia: the “Firehose of Falsehood.” This has now come to dominate American politics as well, and more than ever professional fact checkers — journalists and scholars and dedicated civil servants at our nations’ airport — are needed to counter the damage.
Journalists have long been the target for many of the Trump administration’s attacks, but what happened Oct. 15 is the clearest sign yet that truth is under attack: Reporters for dozens of outlets left the Pentagon after having their accreditation revoked for refusing new rules that would limit their newsgathering. Under Hegseth’s policy, the journalists would have had to agree to only use authorized information provided to them by officials. Even Fox News left. It was the first time since the Pentagon opened in 1943 that no major news sources were accredited.
The Noem TSA videos are playing in just a few airports now.
But what about next time? Perhaps during the next shutdown a few more will give in, just a bit more propaganda wrapped in patriotism. And what about the shutdown after that? The videos will seem just a normal part of life, like the ever-present visage of Big Brother in “1984.”

In downtown Anchorage, protesters filled Town Square Park, and the crowd spilled over to line W 5th and W 6th avenues, where they waved signs and passing cars honked in support. 
“It’s a matter of we are losing our rights,” said Keri Lord of Anchorage, dressed in a long cape and crown for the no kings theme. “And we are headed towards fascism, and it needs to stop now.”

There were speeches, chants, poetry and songs. The crowd also showed support for the evacuees of the devastating storm in western Alaska, and urged donations and continued aid for relief and recovery efforts. Non-profits and advocacy groups hosted tables along the Atwood Concert Hall with educational materials and hot coffee. 
“It’s great to see so many people come out,” said Karan Gier, matching Lord in a cape and crown, holding a sign reading “No troops in our streets.“ And from all ages. That’s what’s especially wonderful. We’ve seen that all summer, because we’ve been to all of (the protests) all summer long. And  it makes your heart feel good to see this. We’re not a silent majority. We are loud.”
At least 25 communities held events throughout the state for No Kings day, including Kotzebue, Nome, Fairbanks, Talkeetna, Healy, Wasilla, Anchorage, Girdwood, Soldotna, Kenai, Homer, Seward, Dillingham, Kodiak, Valdez, Haines, Gustavus, Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and others.

More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned across the country, and millions turned out Saturday to protest the Trump administration
Alaskan’s protest signs shared on social media and in Anchorage used humor and satire to mock and condemn President Donald Trump, his cabinet, and recent moves to expand executive powers as authoritarian. Speakers denounced cuts to federal funding and social services such as Medicaid, disregard for the rule of law, and the ongoing government shutdown.
Many protest signs denounced the deployment of U.S. military troops in Democratic-led cities across the country, and the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement violently arresting immigrants and U.S. citizens.
“I love this country, and I think we should be better,” said Kathryn Schild, a life-long Anchorage resident. “I’m appalled at what we are doing to our friends and our neighbors and our loved ones.”
“And this is what we can do, right?” she said. “We have a voice, we can call, we can protest, we can stand up, and we can demand that our government work for us.”

The problem is the rules for bringing your “wheels” are much different depending on your carrier.


METRO-NORTH: You can bring your non-electric-powered bike on the train anytime except rush-hour.  Some cars include wall-mounted racks; check TrainTime for bike-friendly trains and car markings.  If you have a folding bike that can stow in the overhead rack, you can bring it anytime.
But if your bike or scooter is powered, the rules are quite different.
First, you can’t ride your e-whatever at the station, on the platform or in the train. You can only bring your wheels on the train if it folds up, weighs less than 100 pounds and is your property, i.e. not a CitiBike, VEO etc.
You cannot charge your e-bike on the train.  It must have UL-certified batteries and be stored in an area so it doesn’t block other passengers.  Whatever the rules may be, the train conductor or railroad staffer always has the final say and can stop you and your bike from being on the train.
Remember… if your final destination is Grand Central Terminal there are any number of Citi Bike stations just outside on the street.  At New Haven there are bike-shares available through Ride New Haven.
SHORE LINE EAST and HARTFORD LINE: The e-bike rules here are quite similar.  Unlike on Metro-North, regular (non-electric) bicycles are welcome anytime.  On the Harford Line, CT Rail trains welcome bikes anytime for free.  But Amtrak Hartford Line trains accept bikes only with a reservation and a charge of $20.  All e-bikes with lithium-ion batteries are banned on all trains on the line.
At Hartford’s Union Station you can rent a scooter (but no bikes) through VEO.  Bikes may be added in the future.
CT TRANSIT BUSES: Connecticut’s buses were pioneers in allowing bikes… not on the bus, but on racks mounted on the front of the bus.  The racks only hold two bikes, and its first-come, first-carried.


Only standard non-motorized bikes are allowed on racks; e-bikes, scooters, and motorized vehicles are not permitted, regardless of weight.
OTHER BUSES IN CONNECTICUT: All GBTA (Greater Bridgeport) buses are equipped to carry your bicycle… two-bike maximum, first-come first-served.  Norwalk Transit rules aren’t crystal clear.  You might want to consult your carrier’s website or ask the driver before trying to transport your device.
PORT JEFFERSON FERRY: The Port Jefferson Ferry allows bicycles and e-bikes onboard, but according to company policy, they are considered luggage and must be kept with the rider at all times.  Cyclists are required to carry their bikes as well as any baggage up and down staircases to the passenger decks.  If there’s room you can use the elevator.
Whatever your destination, always BYO (and wear) a helmet when operating on two wheels.  And remember:  E-bikes and scooters should use UL-certified batteries and never be charged aboard any vehicle or station.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/loading-bike-on-bus.jpg,,,2025-10-19 01:02:05.051734

Marchers chanted “Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!” and “We are unstoppable! A better world is possible!”
The march started a little before the UW-Madison football team was scheduled to kick off against Ohio State. A Bucky the Badger who came to the march said he wasn’t upset about missing the game for the protest. “The People’s Bucky believes in democracy… Without democracy, there would be no games,” he said.

Candy Neumeier, a former teacher who drove down from outside of Oshkosh for the rally, said she was attending to “stand up for our rights,” which are “being trampled on by this wannabe dictator and his crew.” She wore a trash bag with Jeffrey Epstein’s face and President Donald Trump’s hand drawn on it. “I really believe that we need to release the Epstein files.”
From a stage set up on the Capitol steps, Ali Muldrow, a Madison school board member and activist who emceed the rally, said there are about 20,000 people at the protest in Wisconsin’s capital city.
Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell told the crowd,“Yes, judges are out here, too. I might get in trouble on Monday, but I’m here right now.”

“You’re living in the redefinition of our democracy right now. Our legal systems are being retooled, reconfigured, and realigned to incentivize ultimate power… The war for civil rights is being waged all over again,” Mitchell added.
Ben Wikler, former Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair, tied the protests and pushback against Trump to the crucial state level elections that will take place in Wisconsin in 2026, including the spring state Supreme Court election, the race for an open gubernatorial seat and races that will determine control of the state Senate and Assembly in the fall.

“The only way to break democracy in America is to break it in the states,” Wikler said. “If Trump wants to be king, he’s going to need people in offices like the governorship who certified elections in the state of Wisconsin and offices, like our state Supreme Court, who will be in his back pocket. Wisconsin, are we going to be in Trump’s back pocket next year?”
The crowd shouted, “No!”  
“Are we gonna be on the streets instead and talk to people who maybe never voted before, but are ready to vote now because they understand what is at stake?” Wikler asked to the sound of cheers. “Are we gonna get out of the boat, and are we gonna win elections and are we going to defend democracy?” 
“Let’s fight! No kings! Forward!” Wikler shouted.

Milwaukee tops 18,000
More than 18,000 protesters filled downtown Milwaukee as part of the No Kings day events taking place across Wisconsin and the country Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump.

A large number of people at the protest said they were motivated to come Saturday as a direct response to what they see as heavy handed actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In recent weeks, ICE has increased its presence in Wisconsin, conducting raids of migrant workers in communities including Madison and Manitowoc.

The protest attendance topped the 16,000 that attended the No Kings protest in the city in June — despite sister events taking place in the Milwaukee County suburbs of Cudahy, Greenfield and Shorewood, and additional events in nearby Waukesha County.
The crowd gathered at Cathedral Square Park, just blocks from city hall, before marching on a 1.8 mile course through downtown.
Mirroring protesters that have gained attention for wearing inflatable costumes during confrontations with federal agents in cities such as Chicago and Portland, Ore., attendees in Milwaukee were dressed as dinosaurs, aliens and unicorns.
At the park, Jim Baran, a Brown Deer resident, sported a banana costume and flew an upside down U.S. flag — a maritime code for distress. Baran said he wanted to attend the protest to show he’s “not going to stand for shenanigans” from the Trump administration.
“He’s selling America, he doesn’t care about Americans,” Baran said.

Stephanie Jacks, a New Berlin resident, said she came to the Milwaukee protest so residents of the city know people in the surrounding communities support it.
“There’s no due process,” she said. “There’s no checks and balances.”
A Milwaukee resident who only gave their name as J. and said they were a first generation Mexican-American, was dressed in an inflatable alien costume in an effort to make Trump claims of violent protesters seem silly and “take the wind out of their sails.”
“This alien is anti-ICE,” they said.
Kelly, a Milwaukee resident who declined to give a last name, said she’s a former deputy sheriff who is “appalled” by the actions of ICE agents. “I can’t believe what they’re doing,” she said. “The level of incompetence, no training, no supervision, no rules. It’s just insane.”

Green Bay rebuffs ICE
On Green Bay protestors’ march downtown, one of their chants was “No KKK, no fascist USA, no ICE.”

By the Brown County Courthouse in downtown Green Bay, protestors sang advice for interacting with law enforcement, including “Ask if you’re free to go, ask for a lawyer, protect yourself and neighbors and record, record, record.”
A speaker called for the crowd to go to their sheriffs about sheriffs’ partnerships with ICE, report possible ICE activity to the advocacy group Voces de la Frontera “so we can protect the immigrants who are amongst us,” tell legislators to pass a bill allowing drivers’ licenses for immigrants without legal status and support families they know who have been separated. 
Other speeches included concerns related to public education, trans rights, Israel and Palestine and free speech.

Rick Crosson, candidate for northeast Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District, came to the protest. He told the Examiner that “for us, it’s about getting back what the Constitution had intended. And that is, have the people run the show. No kings, no dictators, no autocrats.”
Green Bay’s Neville Public Museum is looking for donations that reflect people’s experiences with “No Kings.” In a Facebook post, the museum provided a list of items it is specifically looking for, which includes protest or counter-protest signs, photographs, journal entries and digital recordings. 
“It is our responsibility to collect the stories of today to help create understanding in the future,” the museum explained in a statement.

Hayward sees record crowd

A protest in Hayward, Wisconsin, hometown of Sean Duffy,  Secretary of Transportation topped 1,200 participants, the largest protest ever in the small northern Wisconsin city with a population of about 2,500.

Joan Ackerman of Hayward said the protesters are not “un-American,” as some Republican politicians have claimed, but just want to exercise their freedom of speech about things happening in the country that concern them.
Kay, a woman  from Barnes, Wisconsin, who carried a sign that said “fight truth decay,” said she came to the protest in Hayward “because of the current political environment.” She added, “We have become so divisive because of misleading and alternative facts. We need objective news that is non-partisan.”
Natalie of Hayward, who carried a sign that said, “Health care is a right,” said she was at the protest because she doesn’t  like the direction the country is headed. “We need to make it safe for our kids,” she said.
Steve, another Hayward resident who is an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War, explained that he feels the country is moving away from the core principles of democracy he fought to defend.

Gary Quaderer, Sr., a Vietnam Army vet and spiritual leader of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe said this is the first protest he has ever participated in. “I thought it was very important,” he said. “I don’t like where the country is headed. … I just wanted to come out with all these other good people here just to protest what was going on.”
Paul DeMain, editor of the national News from Indian Country newspaper based in Hayward said the gathering was historic, the largest protest Hayward had ever seen.

‘Love of country’ in Janesville
In a downtown park in Janesville, Wisconsin, organizers estimated 1,000 or more people turned out on a warm, sunny Saturday morning. 
In addition to packing the sidewalks at the intersection of Court and Main streets at the corner of Courthouse Park, rally goers milled through the park space. Many sat in the well surrounding the stage, where a handful of speakers made brief remarks.

“There are 93 rallies in Wisconsin,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth). Pocan recalled the words of the Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson a few days ago.
“They’re trying to falsely call this a Hate America rally,” Pocan said. “People who are here today are the ones who love their country. This rally is really showing that love of country over everything else.”
Another speaker was state Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), whose district includes Janesville. 
“We are here to peacefully demonstrate — as the First Amendment gives us the right to do — and to call on our government to do better, to respect our rights, to respect the Constitution, and to do right by the American people,” Spreitzer told the crowd. 
“We’re also here to say that we are a welcoming community, that immigrants make our community stronger, that LGBT people make our community stronger, that people of color make our community stronger, that people with disabilities make our community stronger.,” Spreitzer said. “We are here to stand up for everybody’s right to coexist as part of our community and to get ahead in life.”
Spreitzer acknowledged that for opponents of the president, Saturday’s rally was but one step in a much longer struggle.

“This is not going to be the last time we’re going to have to keep getting together and doing this,” he said. “I know it is going to be a long fight, but we’re going to win that fight. We’re going to take our country back.”
Virtually every speaker made a point of emphasizing the peaceful intentions and means of participants in the protest. 
State Rep. Ann Roe (D-Janesville), offered her mother’s advice for people who may be confronted by supporters of the president. 
“You know what my mom used to say? Kill them with kindness,” Roe said. “Nothing makes them madder.”
In a brief interview, Roe said that as she wandered through the crowd, she encountered a variety of people she has known from various aspects of her life, all taking part.
“I have seen neighbors here. I have seen people I’ve worked with and we’ve never discussed politics,” Roe said.
“It sounds corny, but that’s what gives me hope. We’re back to the old ways — one-on-one conversations. By remaining kind and open as a long-term strategy, That’s what keeps us from devolving into chaos.”

In Kenosha, resistance through building community
Across the state in the city of Kenosha, a crowd of about 2,500 people filled the sidewalks on both sides of Sheridan Road, Downtown Kenosha’s primary north-south thoroughfare, along a four-block stretch.
Signs, the vast majority of them home-made, filled the air. So did the steady honking of passing cars as drivers sounded their horns in support of the demonstrators throughout the three-hour gathering. The sign-waving crowd cheered back in response.
Organizers had envisioned a dance party theme for their afternoon No Kings protest. A Michael Jackson impersonator lip-synched to recordings of Jackson’s biggest hits while effortlessly mimicking Jackson’s trademark dance steps on the concrete walkway of Civic Center Park.

“We couldn’t drag people away from their chanting and cheering,” said Sheila Rawn, one of the principal organizers for Hands Off Kenosha, which put together the local version of the No Kings demonstration.
“We chose to not even try to have speakers because people don’t want to come and hear speeches,” she added. “They want to stand on the street.” 
Rawn and a co-organizer, Jennifer Weinstein, were both dressed in lion costumes. People were invited to “dress as your favorite king or queen that would do better than the wannabe king that we have in the White House,” Rawn explained. “Yeah, so, no kings — but if we did have a king, you know, like a lion king would make a better king. King Kong would make a better king. A monarch butterfly would make a better king.”
It’s part of the group’s philosophy of “tactical frivolity,” Weinstein said. 
“For the record, We were planning costumes before all the Portland stuff,” Rawn said, referring to the national attention that a Portland protester in a frog suit got recently.

Hands Off Kenosha launched in the spring, an outgrowth of the April 5 Hands Off rally. Having gone to Chicago and Milwaukee for large protest events during Trump’s first administration, “it was important to me to be like, ‘No, we’re doing it here,’” Rawn said. “Kenosha is the fourth largest city in Wisconsin. We are big enough to have our own protests.”
Memories of the unrest Kenosha experienced in 2020, when self-styled militia members clashed with protesters and teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, two of them fatally, an act for which he was later acquitted, have lingered, she acknowledged. 
“I have definitely had conversations with lots of people who have said they’re nervous about coming because the community is still grappling with what happened in 2020,” Rawn said. “And so there are some people who are afraid that violence could happen, but we’ve got over a six-month track record of being peaceful and playful and joyful. And we have been really intentional.”
On a table at one end of the park, bags and bags of personal hygiene products overflowed — a collection that the organizers made part of the event. They had a school supply drive at an August protest and have conducted food drives as well. 
“It’s important to us to include mutual aid,” Rawn said. “Building community is its own form of resistance.”

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Thousands of Nevadans took to streets and sidewalks Saturday to peacefully protest President Donald Trump and air myriad grievances against his administration, including but not limited to the ramping up of disappearances by immigration officers, the deployment of troops into U.S. cities, directing the Justice Department to target his political enemies, attempts to strip health care and social service programs, defunding of medical research, and what even federal judges are characterizing as an unprecedented disregard for the rule of law.
An estimated 2,700 “No Kings” protests were scheduled across the country. Nearly a dozen were scheduled around Nevada, including in Reno, Las Vegas, Carson City, Elko, Pahrump, and Mesquite, according to the official “No Kings” website.

Organizers estimated 18,000 people attended a rally in downtown Reno, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Estimates from Carson City ranged from several hundred to more than a thousand, according to Carson Now.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department announced an estimated crowd of 2,000 in downtown Las Vegas. That rally was organized by Invisible Las Vegas, which also held the inaugural “No Kings” rally in June attended by an estimated 8,000 people. The midday downtown event was one of four planned in the metro area Saturday.

A gathering outside the New York, New York casino on Las Vegas Strip was held later in the afternoon.
Saturday morning, an estimated 3,000 people lined a stretch of a busy thoroughfare in Henderson, according to organizers there. Motorists blared their horns as demonstrators waved signs and cheered.
“We’re a peaceful crowd,” No Kings volunteer Sheila Humphries told the Nevada Current. “No one here believes in violence.”
The crowd in downtown Las Vegas was similarly peaceful and included people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities. Metro police announced there had been just one arrest for disorderly conduct.
As they have during previous protests in downtown Las Vegas, Metro officers wearing riot helmets lined the middle of numerous streets, which they closed to both vehicular traffic and rallygoers. Indivisible Las Vegas organizer Kathy Blair called it an overreaction from Metro, saying they “just want to flex their muscle.”

Speakers, including all three of Nevada’s Democratic U.S. House members, made remarks in front of the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse. But because of the geographic dispersal of the crowd as a result of Metro confining them to sidewalks on either side of Las Vegas Boulevard, only those in the immediate vicinity could hear them.

“There are actually fewer snipers” compared to the June event, Blair quipped, pointing up to the roof of a nearby federal building where several law enforcement officers sat. “They’re wasting taxpayer dollars up there.”
“I guarantee a lot of people did not come out” because they were scared of law enforcement’s presence, said Blair. “A lot of people didn’t RSVP because they didn’t want to put their name down.”
Myriad reasons motivated participants to attend the rally.
“There’s so much,” responded Mason Loosle of Summerlin when asked why he felt compelled to attend. “I don’t know where to start.”
Loosle, who attended the rally with his new wife of one week, held a sign stating they should be on their honeymoon.
“We feel like we had to come out,” he said. “I think the biggest thing is free speech, the (Jimmy) Kimmel thing, the Pentagon press thing. I can’t believe it.”

Shelly Houston of Henderson, a Democrat who has voted for Republicans, said she isn’t sure the United States will have another election.
“I think (Trump) just wants to stay in power and declare himself a ruler for lifetime,” she said.
Many participants expressed support for the Congressional Democrats, who are currently locked in a federal funding battle that has shuttered the government for nearly three weeks. Democrats are holding fast on demanding renewed credits for Obamacare subsidies. 
“I support what they’re doing,” said Alan Scott of Henderson.

Thousands of Vermonters joined more than 40 planned events on Saturday during the state’s second round of “No Kings” protests, which oppose the Trump administration. Photographers Glenn Russell, Jeb Wallace-Brodeur and Sophia Keshmiri fanned out across the state to capture the action.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than 3,000 people gathered in downtown Sioux Falls on Saturday for the latest No Kings protest – making it the city’s largest protest so far this year, according to organizer crowd estimates.
The protest was the 13th in South Dakota for the day, organizer Craig Brown said. Protesters gathered to listen to speakers, display homemade signs and chant “this is what democracy looks like” and “we love America; that’s why we’re here,” and call for President Donald Trump “to go.”
Brown said the turnout is a testament to the movement’s momentum and people’s anger at the Trump administration.
“There’s a sense of commitment in this crowd that we haven’t felt before,” Brown said.

More than 2,600 No Kings rallies with millions in attendance took place across the country on Saturday. The second No Kings day, following the first in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”
Lexi Pratt, of Sioux Falls, brought her daughter to the No Kings protest in Sioux Falls, saying that she “could not, in good conscience, be a good parent” without standing up when she sees something wrong. She’s concerned about women’s health care and the Trump administration’s “attack on our public education.”
“The Trump administration is violating all the checks and balances that our country was founded on to ensure that we all have the same rights,” Pratt said.
Jody Fleischhacker, of Sioux Falls, wore a frog hat — a symbol of resistance after a Portland protester wearing an inflatable frog costume was sprayed with chemicals through his costume’s air vent by a federal agent earlier this month.
Fleischhacker, who is an Air Force veteran, said she attended both No Kings protests in Sioux Falls this year because she believes Trump is unsuitable for office and should be removed.
“He’s made changes that are hurting his own people,” Fleischhacker said. “He wants to build a big, beautiful ballroom and yet take away our health care and take away food benefits to people who need them.”
The turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations despite a police investigation into a suspicious vehicle that was viewed as a potential explosives threat at the site of the protest the night before. The area was shut down to the public between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. before police determined there were no explosives in the area.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

A counter protest, dubbed the “Real American Rally,” was held during the same time a block away from the No Kings protest. It drew about 30 people.
John Small, an organizer of the counter protest, said the gathering was intended to be positive and show “love for the country we live in.”
“I understand there are people who don’t like our current president. I understand that they want their voices heard. That’s great. But I don’t know how this is going to help,” Small said, referring to the No Kings protest. “Do they think there is going to be something to come from this?”
Brown said he sees the No Kings movement continuing up until the 2026 elections. That could impact midterm elections and turnout to create “real, sustained pushback against this regime.”
But the real impact of Saturday’s protest is a continued effort to build community, Brown added.
“Maybe I look across the crowd and I see my neighbor who I had no idea they feel like I do. Maybe I go and talk to them and we connect. We decide to go to a city council or county commission meeting we’re concerned about together,” Brown said. “Those are touch points that we’re seeing in real time. This is working.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/591A2067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

See Colorado Newsline’s live coverage of No Kings protests here.


An overflow crowd spilled into Civic Center Park, and multiple streets surrounding the Capitol grounds were shut down as the event began just after noon. Near the state Capitol steps, attendees heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who told the crowd in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers. “We will not be painted as domestic terrorists. We are just Coloradans, just Americans, who are calling a spade a spade and a dictator a dictator — because that is our constitutional right to do so.”
Tiffany Weber, founder of the activist group Solidarity Warriors and one of the Denver protest’s organizers, blasted U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s characterization of the nationwide No Kings event this week as a “Hate America” rally.
“He has the gall to say we hate America. We love America,” Weber told the crowd. “We love the loud, beautiful, chaotic streets of Denver. We love the variety of ways that people show up to protests, and we hate the fact that not everyone can safely exercise their American right to free speech.”

Organizers of the Denver protest estimate that more than 25,000 demonstrators were in attendance, Salazar told Newsline. An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Colorado Springs. The nationwide No Kings Coalition, partners of which include liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU, estimated 7 million people turned out Saturday to demonstrate against what it called Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
The latest round of protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.










I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution.


– Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita, at the No Kings demonstration in Grand Junction


Throughout the day, the atmosphere at Saturday’s demonstration in Denver was similarly peaceful and festive, featuring countless satirical anti-Trump protest signs — “The Only Thing Colorado Likes More Than Hiking on a Saturday Is Our Democratic Rights,” read one — and dozens of protesters clad in inflatable costumes of the kind recently popularized by protesters in Portland.
Gerry Lauer, a demonstrator dressed in an inflatable chicken costume, said he had been inspired by footage of the Portland protests and ordered the costume online before Saturday’s event.
“Portland did a great job of finding a way to eliminate the hostility, (and) kind of create that safe place to be,” Lauer said. “It’s a real serious time, but we don’t need to be creating violence and hostility. We need to figure out how to get it around that.”

‘This insanity has to stop’
Coloradans also turned out for a No Kings protest in Grand Junction, where an organizer with Indivisible said thousands had turned out in the Western Slope city to protest the Trump administration.
One of those participants was Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita.
“I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution,” he said.

Kerri Osterguard traveled from the town of Mesa to attend the No Kings rally in Grand Junction.
“This insanity has to stop. It’s out of control,” she said.
Rick Griffith, Bev Griffith, Bill Shelton and Connie Ellenberger displayed protest signs designed by Shelton. Bev Griffith said the Grand Junction event was their first No Kings rally and that they participated because President Donald Trump is “running our country into the ground” and “he should be behind bars.”

Tensions over immigration enforcement
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Tensions have risen in cities like Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles as ICE enforcement operations have become more expansive and aggressive, drawing protests that Trump administration officials have in turn harshly criticized and sought to meet with further crackdowns by federal law enforcement, as well as troop deployments. Trump told an audience of top U.S. military leaders last month that American cities should be used as “training grounds for our military,” and he has repeatedly spoken of invoking the Insurrection Act to broaden his authority to deploy the military against U.S. citizens.

Trump’s mass deportation program has been bolstered by $45 billion in new ICE funding in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July. At least 170 people with U.S. citizenship have been swept up in the agency’s expanded enforcement operations so far this year, ProPublica reported Thursday.
“We can’t treat people like this. We can’t treat anybody like this, let alone immigrants who are minding their own business and doing their work,” said Emily Magner, an Aurora resident who attended Saturday’s protest at the Capitol. “(They say) ‘We’re only after the bad ones.’ Well, then why are you going to meatpacking plants (and) places where you think immigrants would work?”

After hearing from rally speakers, thousands of demonstrators marched away from the Capitol down 15th Street into Denver’s Central Business District. Before the march, Julian Camera of the American Civil Liberties Union spoke to the crowd about their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech and the right to remain silent if detained by law enforcement.
“The reason I share these rights with you today is because it’s rookie hour at the federal government, and if you’re detained by law enforcement, they might try to intimidate you and lie to you about your rights,” Camera said. “We’re not going to let them get away with trying to rewrite the Constitution just because Trump is telling them to.”
Following the march, most demonstrators left the Capitol area by 4 p.m. A much smaller group of protesters later marched to 20th and Chestnut streets, where Denver Police Department officers “dispersed the group to deny access to the highway” and made multiple arrests, according to a DPD social media post.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Thousands of people gathered at 10 events across Louisiana as part of Saturday’s national No Kings movement to protest President Donald Trump. Beyond their criticisms of the administration, organizers and participants shared messages of unity and countered Republicans who labeled their events as “hate rallies.” 
Helping set that lighter tone were several rally participants in costumes. Some were getting a jump start on Halloween while others said they took their inspiration from protestors in Portland, Oregon, who’ve demonstrated while in disguise against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in their city. 
In New Orleans, where little excuse is needed for costuming, thousands showed up for a concert and rally along the Lafitte Parkway. The city hosted a parade through the Marigny neighborhood during the first No Kings day in June.  
Among the participants was Elaine Ravich, 96, who held a sign identifying her as part of the Greatest Generation and an opponent of tyranny.
“We fought in the 1940s, and there are not too many of my generation alive,” Ravich said. “I am representing every single one of them that was here, and we were fighting again for our children, grandchildren and generations to come, and we will not allow this to happen.”

Hundreds took part in the No Kings event at Zemurray Park in Hammond, which featured equal parts protest, parody and picnic. 
Participant Katie Greer of Slidell was part of the crowd, wearing a cap to honor her Navy veteran husband, Paul, who died in August. He would have been alongside her at the protest had he not succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease, she said.
Greer noticed that a sizable portion of the crowd were, like her, senior citizens. She recounted her involvement in comparable protests against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
“We did this once. We’re back to do it again,” Greer said.
On the other end of the age spectrum were the two school-aged children of Daisy and Michael Daigle, also from Slidell. The couple said it was important for them to take part in Saturday’s event as a family to show their son and daughter they don’t agree with the direction of the nation under Trump’s leadership.

Speakers at the Hammond event urged those in attendance to stay active and connected, even though they are greatly outnumbered by Republicans in the Northshore region. The parishes in the area are split between the congressional districts of U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, R-Start.      
Daisy Daigle said the rally provided some encouragement to those who might feel their voices aren’t heard.   
“To be able to come here to see this and have a community and see it is really good, right? Because not everybody can make it to meetings,” she said. “We’re all struggling day to day just to get by. So to have this one day to be able to come out is really important. 
More than 150 people assembled at the edge of Lock Park in downtown Lake Charles for its No Kings event, while a small group of counter-protestors stood across a quiet side street.
Matthew Desormeaux was among the rally participants, holding a sign that read: “Abolish ICE is now the moderate position.” He said he considers immigration an important issue on both a national and state level. 
“This is home. I was born and raised here,” Desormeaux said. “Lake Charles is a conservative area, but we’ve got to let [undocumented] people know that they’re not alone.”

Louisiana has nine ICE detention and staging facilities and is second only to Texas, with 23 ICE detention centers, with nearly 7,500 people in custody according to immigrant rights advocacy groups. Gov. Jeff Landry declared an emergency to expedite the refurbishment of a maximum security section of Louisiana State Penitentiary so it could also house ICE detainees.
“Immigrants are members of our community and should have the right to live and work where they want because they contribute,” Desormeaux added.
Sam McNabb stood with seven other men across the street from the No Kings assembly, flanked by two flags – one U.S. flag in black and another that read “MAGA Trump 45 47.”
“Trump’s not a king. If he were, they’d be in jail, all these cuckoos,” McNabb said, gesturing toward the No Kings rally across the street. 
McNabb said the other men with him were on their lunch break, and that the No Kings rally participants must not have jobs. 
One of the counter-protesters crossed the street to wave a flag in front of the crowd that read “Don’t tread on Trump.” A small rope barricade separated him from No Kings protestors. On his second pass down the block, local No Kings organizer Carolyn Woosley escorted the man..
“He just took my arm and said let’s go,” Woosley told the Illuminator.

Other No Kings events in Louisiana took place in Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Monroe, Ruston, Alexandria and Lafayette. 
In addition, Bradley Hesson, a 15-year-old Leesville High School student, organized what he described as a peaceful protest outside City Hall against Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson “and more of our leaders who don’t want to take accountability,” he said.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-19 00:00:44+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"‘No Kings’ Boston Rally Draws Thousands of Protesters, Few Clashes",Jane Petersen,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/no-kings-boston-rally-draws-thousands-of-protesters-few-clashes/,"“The demonstrations were organized to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity.”","On Saturday, a crowd of about 100,000 demonstrators flocked to Boston Common to protest the Trump administration. Organizers of the “No Kings” rally called it a “movement for our collective liberation.” 
Republicans have referred to the series of rallies as “Hate America Day,” although presence from opposition leaders at the event itself was minimal. 
“We are living almost in a police state now where people are being disappeared, taken away with men and women in military gear wearing masks,” said Lisa Mahoney of Beverley, Mass. “I was a human rights activist with Amnesty International for 15 years. I worked for people in many other countries that were in this sort of situation. I never thought I’d see it happen here.” 
The “No Kings” rally in Boston was one of dozens taking place across the state and one of more than 2,000 taking place across the country. The demonstrations were organized by a consortium including several unions, faith leaders, activists, and the American Civil Liberties Union to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity. 
Several Massachusetts politicians, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, made appearances. Protestors brought thousands of signs, deriding the president and his cabinet for policies related to their use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the cutting of scientific research at the federal level, and attacks on freedom of speech. 
Unlike similar protests that have occurred across the country in recent months, there was minimal conflict during the event. There was no major effort to organize counter-protestors, and Boston Police officers remained largely disengaged with the crowd, mostly sticking to their posts near the entrances to the Common. According to the department, no arrests were made in association with the event. 
The mass deportations by ICE and the deployment of the national guard into US cities under the second Trump administration was a major theme of many of the speeches at the event.  
“It’s no surprise that the White House wants to attack us. To seize more power, they need people to believe that this country and our cities are in a state of disaster,” said Wu. “Day after day, this president and his corrupt cabinet mistake cruelty for greatness, and payoffs for power.” 
She also invoked Boston’s historical role in overthrowing autocrats.  
“For the last 250 years and counting in Boston, every day is ‘No Kings day,’” she added 
Wu powered through her speech despite some chants from protestors, calling her a “liar” and “for hire.” Rahsaan Hall, president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts and emcee for the day’s main stage events, addressed the jeers following her remarks. 
“This is what democracy looks like. It’s not nice and neat, it’s not clean and squeaky. It’s messy. It’s disruptive. It’s uncomfortable,” Hall said. “If we can’t tolerate disruption within the midst of our own disruptive protest, we’re doing it wrong.” 
The response from Republicans across the state was somewhat muted. Mike Kennealy, who is running in the GOP primary for next year’s governor’s race, criticized Gov. Maura Healey’s job performance thus far. “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day’, consider this,” he posted to X, “There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities. A politician who stood by while unemployment rose by 23%, and did nothing.” 
In an interview set to air on Fox News on Sunday, Trump downplayed the rallies. “They’re referring to me as a king,” Trump said. “I’m not a king.” 
Many protestors disagreed, likening the President to an autocrat. 
“I came out here because of the way the Trump administration is oppressing our free speech,” said Boston resident Mary Buonanno. “I felt it was important that they knew, and that we stood strong against having a dictator in the White House.”  
Protestors also called for unity against what they viewed as a growing threat. 
“I’m independent, neither Republican or Democrat,” said Boston resident Paul Finnegan. He said he attended the rally because the lies told by Trump had “just gone too far.” 
“The joke was that he could go to Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still get elected, but now he’s got a whole chorus of people who are just tearing up the Constitution. That’s enough.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-18-at-7.53.35-PM.png?fit=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

The event came four months after an innocent bystander, Afa Ah Loo, was shot and killed in Salt Lake City at a No Kings protest planned by a different group.
This time, organizers worried that memories of the tragedy and violence in June were still too fresh and many would still feel too afraid to attend, said Jamie Carter, a volunteer with Salt Lake Indivisible who planned Saturday’s rally.
But afterward, Carter said she hoped the event – fairly relaxed and punctuated by boisterous moments – restored a sense of safety and solidarity for anyone who felt uneasy. 
“It felt like our goals were met, both helping to heal the community, and providing a place for people to express their anger, but to leave with joy,” Carter said. 
Haylee Bowcut, 25, said she had some anxiety about the protest because of the June shooting, but decided Saturday morning to attend and bring a sign saying, “Hate never made a country great.” 
“It just felt like the right thing, to go today,” said Bowcut, of Pleasant View.
Many outside the Capitol chanted, “We are the patriots!,” wore costumes and came with friends or family, listening intently to speakers, a comedian and musical performances during the roughly two-hour event. 
“We’re going to hold every government official accountable, from the highest levels of power, including every ICE agent,” Carter said from a podium on the Capitol steps, to thunderous applause. 
She and other speakers said they want to see compassion inform new immigration laws, along with an end to the nation’s health care “crisis” and stricter gun laws to help protect children. 
Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP’s Salt Lake branch, condemned Trump’s appointment of “anti-civil rights extremists” in roles enforcing the nation’s civil rights laws.






























Many seemed to take inspiration from protesters in Portland, dressing in towering inflatable costumes depicting dinosaurs, axolotls, chickens, and a bumble bee, in a nod to Utah’s moniker, the Beehive State. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week described No Kings as “pro-Hamas,” and a “Hate American rally.” 
Speaking through a small window in her inflatable unicorn costume, Barbara Scott of Bluffdale rejected that. 
“I’m not paid to be here, I’m not AI, and I’m not a terrorist,” Scott said, showing off signs she made featuring the same messages. 
Scott also reflected on the violence that’s happened at demonstrations and political events like June’s protest and Charlie Kirk’s killing at the campus of Utah Valley University. 
As for her concern about her own safety while protesting, she said, “I have more concern about what’s going to happen to our country if we don’t get it back. At least if we die here, we die trying.” 
Organizers originally planned to follow the Capitol rally with a march to the Salt Lake City and County building, but canceled the march Tuesday when online RSVPs flooded in faster than they’d expected. They worried the crowd size for a march was too big for the few dozen unarmed safety volunteers they trained, Carter said. 
On Saturday, Utah’s Department of Public Safety estimated attendance at 3,500, while Carter said she believed it was much higher, near 10,000. 
Former state Sen. Steve Urquhart, who served in the Utah Legislature as a Republican from 2001-2016, was also in the crowd. He recalled believing years ago that any forces seeking to undercut democracy would come from the political left, but said he now feels differently. 
“Guess I was wrong about that one,” Urquhart said. He added that concerns about safety were on his mind before the rally. 
“Should we go, should we mask up? What should we do?” Urquhart recalled thinking. “When the administration is actively saying it’s targeting its opponents, that’s frightening.” 
Few counterprotesters came to the event. When a group of about three men, one wearing a ‘Trump 2024’ hat arrived at the Capitol lawn and started speaking through a megaphone, dozens in the No Kings group surrounded them, chanting, “No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderThousands of people gathered Saturday in Atlanta as part of the No Kings rallies taking place nationwide, where speakers sounded the alarm against the potential for authoritarian rule under the Trump administration.
Speakers, which included prominent Georgia political figures and leaders of civil rights and advocacy organizations, described the current climate as a move away from democracy. It was a noticeable shift in tone from the No Kings events in June, when organizers warned of some of the administration’s undemocratic behaviors, such as hosting a military parade coinciding with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams framed the political battle as a fight over the nation’s direction.
“It used to be that we were all headed to the same destination. We just had different routes,” Abrams said to the crowd. “We may have a different way to get there, but the route we were going to take was democracy … but on the other side, they decided that the route they wanted to take was not democracy, but authoritarianism.”

Organizers say more than 10,000 people turned out Saturday at the Atlanta Civic Center, one of over 40 events held across Georgia, before marching to the state Capitol, but the actual number could be closer to 12,000, said Laura Judge with Indivisible North Metro, which is one of the event’s organizers. Martha Shockey, a convener of the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, said more than 5,000 people registered ahead of the protest. 
Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, told the crowd that the Trump administration has created a two-tiered system of justice where some are “above the law” and others are below.
“We love America too much to give it over to a wannabe king,” Young said. “The Trump regime puts billionaires above the law … at the same time, the Trump regime acts like some of us are below the law.”
In an interview Friday ahead of the rally, Young cited several examples of the current administration’s alleged abuses. She pointed to the administration’s actions on immigrant rights, including the denial of due process for people suspected of living in the country unlawfully and the attempt to abolish the 14th Amendment’s citizenship provision by executive order — a move the ACLU is challenging. She also raised concerns over the deployment of military personnel in American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the “dismantling” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and what she called the undermining of “facts and science.”

Abby Tighe, a founding member of Fired but Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and public health allies, described the latest mass terminations at the agency as “another deliberate attempt to traumatize federal workers and attack the American public.” The CDC workforce has shrunk by about 3,000 this year, with the latest round of layoffs in October affecting about 600 workers.
“Donald Trump continued to spread lies about vaccines, medications, and research. Their lies about vaccines have led to mistrust and violence. Their dehumanization and vitriol is directly responsible for the August attack on CDC that claimed the life of DeKalb County’s officer (David) Rose, while my friends and own child cowered in fear,” Tighe said.
Sen. Raphael Warnock speaks at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Georgia U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock urged the audience to stand up for democracy and fight for their rights. Warnock pointed to the importance of unity and cooperation, regardless of political affiliation, and called for the end of the government shutdown and the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies.
“We don’t have to do one or the other. We can do both at the same time,” he said.
He also warned against the dangers of fascism and the need to fight for the rights of all people, including Palestinians, Israelis, Ukrainian children and American citizens.
“You cannot outsource democracy to anybody. You cannot outsource citizenship. It is all of us. That’s why they’re trying to divide us, because when all of us stand together and raise our voices, we win,” he said.
James Salter said he showed up at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025 to fight fascism because he worries that ignoring the Constitution will lead to a dictatorship run by the rich. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
James Salter said he participated in the rally because he’s “trying to rebuff fascism while we still care,” saying he’s concerned about law and order under Trump.
“If the Constitution is no longer understood and taken seriously, then we slip into a fascist dictatorship that is ruled by the ultra rich. And we lose,” he said.
James Threatt, who also attended the rally in Atlanta, said that the name of the No Kings march spoke for itself.
“This man is setting himself up as the king, and he’s not,” he said. “This is America.”

Threatt also said he was concerned about how the Trump administration was treating immigrants, saying the mass arrests were violating people’s civil rights, which he compared to the struggle for Black civil rights.
“They’re taking civil rights away from people, period,” he said. “Not only Black people but everybody else.”
Lloyd Norman said he hoped to be a “small voice” to help hold power to account.
“Hitler had something called the Big Lie theory, that if I say it long enough and loud enough, people will say it for me,” Norman said. “That’s why I’m here, because we have to say ‘you’re lying.'”
Speakers also called for ongoing, non-violent action and engagement in local elections. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Lithonia urged the crowd to embody Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision of the “beloved community,” which King used to describe a society that is free from discrimination and poverty and is based on peace, justice and equality.
“We, the people, are the ones to create the beloved community, and we do it through love, passion, non-violence,” Johnson said before the crowd marched to the Capitol.

Amanda Solberg-Bowen, who lives near Watkinsville, showed up Saturday in a newly acquired inflatable frog costume. She was one of many people who showed up at a No Kings rally Saturday dressed up in inflatable costumes as a nod to the so-called “Portland Freedom Frog.” Earlier this month, a federal agent in Portland shot pepper spray inside of a protester’s inflatable frog costume while demonstrating outside of an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
“Somebody said a minute ago that it’s a great way to be present but also be obviously nonviolent – a disarming sort of presence,” Solberg-Bowen said of her costume, adding that being there Saturday felt like “the least that we can do.”
Taffy Jo Mayers said her sense of patriotism is what brought her to the rally. She also expressed concerns about how the government is treating immigrants.
“I’ve been an immigrant,” she said. “I’ve lived and worked in foreign countries, and the way that America is treating the people that are coming here is abhorrent. It’s inhumane.”
This was Julie Runk’s second No Kings rally. As she waited for marchers to reach the state Capitol, the Atlanta resident waved to passing cars and held a sign that said “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism. Oh, and release the Epstein files.”

“People ask me, ‘Why are you doing it? It’s not going to change anything,'” Runk said. “I’m just unhappy with what’s happening and I want to do whatever I can. This is a small bit.”
Runk said she relishes the sense of community she finds at the No Kings events, but she also said she believes that speaking out helps to empower others to do the same.
“I also know that this administration doesn’t like to look bad and this makes them look bad,” Runk said of the No Kings rallies. “And when ICE is fighting with people in inflatable frog suits, it makes them look like idiots, and they don’t like to be embarrassed. So, this to me is a good way to get under their skin if nothing else,” she said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)In Queen Anne’s County, where 62% of voters went for President Donald Trump in last year’s election, some of the people who showed up for the No Kings rally said they were pleasantly surprised by Saturday’s turnout.
Several hundred people turned up, many waving hand-drawn signs by the roadside in Centreville’s small historic downtown, while others gathered in the courtyard, where a musician performed at a piano, and organizers opened the mic for testimonials.
“The honks and waves way outnumber the middle fingers,” said Tom Gallagher, 74, of the public response to No Kings in Centreville. The Anne Arundel County resident crossed the Bay Bridge to attend the rally here.
Back across the Bay in Baltimore — where 12.8% of voters backed Trump in 2024 — the challenge was not getting people to turn out, but managing No Kings on the same day as the 25th annual Baltimore Running Festival, when an estimated 10,000 runners were expected to take over downtown to compete in everytingn from a 5K to a full marathon.
Most coped by combining the two events, with runners wearing No Kings gear and No Kings attendees lining the race route with signs playing off the combination of the two events, like the one that said, “You’re running better than the government.”
Jackie Bustos took advantage of the scheduling of the events to accomplish personal goal of completing a half marathon while also protesting Trump policies on immigration and other issues.
“I felt supported,” said Bustos, who ran with a No Kings sign on her back. “Throughout the city, there were tons of signs that were supporting the cause. So I was running, but there were also people saying ‘no fascism, no kings.’”

The Baltimore and Centreville rallies were just two of more than 60 events scheduled in Maryland Saturday, from Ocean City to LaVale and from Northeast to Lexington Park and scores of points in between.
They were in big cities like Baltimore and small towns like Centreville. They were in deep blue counties like Montgomery, which had more than a dozen events scheduled, to deep red counties like Carroll, where one event was scheduled for the County Government Building in Westminster for those willing to brave it.
Nationwide, more than 2,700 events were planned, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia, where as many as 100,000 were expected to turn out. Events were being held overseas as well, in Australia and across Europe – although events in the United Kingdom were tactfully labeled “No Tyrants” events.
Some estimates said turnout for the weekend’s events could be in the millions.
The latest rallies are a followup to No Kings events in June that were held to counter President Donald Trump’s massive military parade in Washington to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Army – and, some say not coincidentally, Trump’s 79th birthday.
There were about 2,000 events in June. Organizers said they scheduled this weekend’s events because Trump “has doubled down” since the first rallies, ramping up immigration raids and deploying troops to Democratic cities and urging the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies.
A main theme of the events, besides no kings, is peaceful protest. Rallygoers are told to leave weapons at home and are trained in de-escalation techniques. And in Maryland, at least, it seemed to be working, only minimal conflicts reported.
‘What was your tipping point?’
Standing in the courtyard in front of the Queen Anne’s County historic courthouse in Centreville, a bulletin board asked locals: “What was your tipping point?”
No more context was needed.
“The day he was elected — the first time,” read one sticky note. “Musk + DOGE,” read another. “The Apprentice,” one attendee wrote.

“We wanted to know, what was that moment that you felt like you needed to come?” said Elaine McNeil, chair of the Queen Anne’s Democratic Central Committee, which organized Saturday’s event. “Because that’s the feedback that we need to get other people to that tipping point to start standing up.”
Gallagher, the Anne Arundel County resident who traveled to Centreville for the rally, said he has been disturbed by the administration’s decision to attack ships off the coast of Venezuela, killing several people.
“Even if he’s correct that they’re drug dealers, that’s still a legal matter, not a military matter,” said Gallagher, a retired Navy veteran. “You’re being judge, jury and executioner for people out on boats in the water. It’s beyond the pale.”
No Kings protests dotted Maryland’s rural and conservative Eastern Shore, running up U.S. Route 50 from Ocean City and Salisbury to Cambridge and Easton, where protesters lined the busy highway beside a Wawa convenience store, attracting a smattering of honks as cars drove past. A single counter-protester stood in the grass behind them, yelling “We love President Trump.” But he was handily outnumbered, as the assembled group chanted: ““Love, not hate, makes America great.”
Beverly Fox, 75, an Easton resident who is disabled, uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. On Saturday, the back of her wheelchairt sported an image of Trump wearing a crown with the message “No Kings.”
“That man has got to go,” said Fox, who worries about Trump’s attacks on health insurance for vulnerable Americans. “Every day I think I can’t get shocked any more.”
In Easton’s Talbot County, Trump’s victory was far narrower than elsewhere on the Eastern Shore, winning 11,125 votes to 11,119 for Vice President Kamala Harris.
For many attendees on Saturday, it felt difficult to choose just one reason they were drawn to decorate handmade signs and wave them by the roadside.

“I don’t even know where to start,” said Ashley Cromwell, a Queenstown resident who came to Centreville with a “We the People” sign.
“Since Trump first — in 2015 — came on the scene this way, I’ve been against what he stands for, and the hatred and the anger and the division and the way that he wants to take power for himself,” Cromwell said.
Even if it was sometimes hard to articulate, attendees on Saturday were united by a passion to speak up against Trump.
Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident, said she began attending anti-Trump protests for the first time in March.
“I’m out here for the people that can’t be out here,” said Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident. “Because there are people that are either disabled or they’re afraid, or they’ve been fighting forever.”
But, like many at the rallies, she was keeping it light. Leonard wore an inflatable otter costume Saturday and carried a sign that said, “You otter join us!” adding that she was gunning for a “positive, unifying” message.
‘Run like Trump’s behind you’
Positive energy was very much the mood in Baltimore, where the marathon route was lined with people who alternated between those holding anti-Trump protest signs or posterboards offering encouragement from enthusiastic friends and families. Or both.
“That’s one of the things I love about Baltimore,” Bustos said. “It’s really nice to be in Baltimore and see that there’s this energy for the runners and also supporting a very big political cause.”
Brenden Caffey, 30, said that he and his wife had been in other running festivals before, but having a message this time brought a new energy to the challenge. He painted his shirt Friday night with “NO KINGS” in preparation for the run.

“It was nice … I think it was kind of cool that it was able to be combined a little bit,” Caffey said.
Protesters on the sides of the tracks shouted words of encouragement while their signs disparaged the Trump administration.  People like Lior Levy, 28, who stood on the sidelines with a sign declaring “Baltimore says ‘No Kings.’” She said that merging the rally with the marathon provided “a lot of visibility” for the political demonstration.
“Us being here for the runners, it drives them. And them having the signs rallies us — and it’s a good back and forth,” Levy said.
Chris Ryder, 65, a former U.S. Agency for International Development employee who retired during the first Trump administration, said  the recent federal layoffs are just one of the many reasons to come out to the marathon and protest along the track.
“We came out because we think we all need to raise our voices against so much of what’s going on with this administration,” he said.
Laurie Rome, 63, said that while the Baltimore No Kings rally was a little more spread out than other protests, it was still important to show up, “no matter the format.”
“It’s kind of nice to have it sort of pervasive along the route. Not just people clustered in one place,” she said. “There are people everywhere who think that the current level of unkindness, instability and hatred is not okay.”
Protesters lining the roads — and the marathon routes — seemed to be popular venues. In Prince George’s County, sporadic clumps of protesters lined U.S. Route 1 from the Washington, D.C., line to the University of Maryland, College Park, and beyond.
On the Eastern Shore, Denise Perdue of Graysonville stood on the side of the road and talked about her “tipping point” while waving a sign. For Perdue, it was Nov. 5, 2024, when Trump was elected a second time.

“I didn’t think that there was so much hate in the United States as there is, and so much bigotry,” she said, adding that she felt that the electorate scorned Harris, the Democratic nominee, because she is a woman of color.
As Perdue held a sign inviting passersby to “Honk for Humanity,” one driver in a pickup truck flew past: “Sore losers!” he yelled.
Perdue was quick to respond: “Jesus loves you!” she shouted back. It was the same response she’d used all day for the occasional heckler passing through.
“Because, what are you going to say to that?” she joked.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Thousands of Kentuckians turned out under the autumn sun to protest President Donald Trump’s administration, some pointedly refuting Republican claims disparaging their motives.
In Lexington, Gracia O’Brien, 71, said “when folks in Congress said this was going to be a ‘hate America’ rally, I said ‘no, I love America.’ I want my grandchildren to know I stood up. I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” 
Marsha Bezold of Midway hoisted a sign showing a U.S. flag and the words “Pro-America. Anti-Trump.” She cited multiple reasons for protesting, from “the dismantling of our Constitution” to coming cuts in health care that she said will hurt her family.  She said she thinks Trump’s goal is to intimidate Americans into keeping silent about his unprecedented power grabs. This is not the country I grew up in. I think Ronald Reagan would be rolling over in his grave to see this.”
In Louisville, former Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth greeted a large crowd gathered on the Belvedere:  “Hello all my fellow terrorists. Apparently that’s who the Republicans and the administration think we are: terrorists, antifa, violent criminals.” 
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer recently said Democrats would “rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.” House Speaker Mike Johnson described “No Kings” as a “hate America” rally
Yarmuth added that he thought the gathered crowd should show their “antifa membership cards” to Trump.
Protesters also rallied in smaller Kentucky towns. In Pikeville, a small crowd gathered, holding signs that said, among other things, “Hillbillies against Facism,” Mountain Top News reported. The Owensboro Times reported more than 500 people attended a downtown rally in the Daviess County seat. “The scene remained peaceful throughout the event.”

In Morehead, organizers reported “over 300 people and two dinosaurs” gathered for the “No Kings” rally. Speakers in the Rowan County seat included two Democrats running for U.S. Congress: attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who is hoping to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Rep. Hal Rogers, and Logan Forsythe, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

In Lexington, police blocked streets as thousands of protesters marched through downtown; observers said it was one of the largest demonstrations they had ever seen in Kentucky’s second-largest city.



































Capitol rally in Frankfort
While the state Capitol is closed amid a renovation project, protesters were able to peacefully gather on its steps. Similar demonstrations have been held at the site since Trump took office earlier this year for the second time. 
Dennis Van Horn, a Frankfort resident and veteran, listened to speakers on the Capitol lawn while holding a sign that said a chant the crowd used throughout the day: “No thrones, no crowns, no kings” — a chant that was heard throughout the day. He said Saturday’s crowd was twice the size of the first“No Kings” rally in June.
Van Horn said he wanted to attend Saturday’s protest “because (of) the anxiety from watching our president trash the Constitution, rule of law and take retribution on his enemies.” 
“And that’s not the way it’s supposed to be,” he added.

Woodford County resident Alyssa Cumming and her dog, Cody, came to the Capitol to stand for her friends and family who are immigrants but are afraid to make their voices heard at this time. Cumming and Cody attended protests earlier this year. 
She raised concerns about the direction of the country, adding that “we’re not moving any closer to greatness right now.” 
“I just feel like everybody can do something,” Cumming said. “I don’t have any political power other than my feet.”
Some politicians also joined the crowd. Speaking through a microphone, Democratic state Rep. Erika Hancock, of Frankfort, addressed the rally and was supportive of the group’s message. 
“This No Kings rally is about reminding everyone in power that they serve the people, not the other way around,” she says to cheers.
John “Drew” Williams, a Democratic candidate challenging Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer in Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, said the Frankfort rally was his second of the day after another event in Danville. Williams, who is from far West Kentucky, said it was important for him to be in Frankfort because of the town’s importance to the state and because Franklin County was added to the 1st Congressional District during redistricting. In Comer’s district, a thin line of counties along Kentucky’s southern border connects the state’s far western tip and the Mississippi River with Franklin and Boyle counties in Central Kentucky.
“This is what democracy looks like,” Williams said. “This is what the conversation wants to be, not just right now when we feel like there is a set of government overreach, but every year and every day.”

In Louisville, thousands gathered at the Belvedere, a grassy event space next to the Muhammed Ali Center in downtown Louisville, hearing from a range of elected officials and advocates after marching and chanting through the city streets. 
Rebecca Elliott of Louisville watched marchers holding signs, including one that read: “Immigrant Rights Are Citizen’s Rights” — one of many signs that referenced the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. 
“The right of due process applies to all of us. So, if we allow people to start taking that right away from our immigrant neighbors, then we’re also going to end up not having it in the long run, too,” Elliott said. “I think we have to defend the more vulnerable people so that we can maintain our own rights.” 
Other signs by protesters in Louisville referenced Trump’s executive orders, including one that designated antifa, a left-wing anti-facist political movement, as a domestic terrorist organization. Jamie and Brian Reichenbach came to the Louisville protest from Spencer County, holding a sign with the word antifa and an arrow pointing at themselves. 
Jamie Reichenbach said given that the country ought fascism in the past, she wanted to show that “we’re antifa.” 
“We stand for anti-fascism, which is what America was supposed to be,” Reichenbach said.
Brad Ector of Louisville, who sported an inflatable dragon costume that was buffeted by the wind as he marched, said he didn’t “want Portland to have all the fun.” 
“Just all the people in Portland that are there, pointing out the fact that they are not the terrorists that Trump wants us to believe,” Ector said. 
“As far as the dragon goes, someone needs to melt ice,” Ector said, apparently referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.
At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.
For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.
As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.
Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd. 
Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE. 
Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest. 
“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”
Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.
“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.
The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.
Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.” 
Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”
There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.
On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.
The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.
A number of political groups and campaigns, including the Democratic Socialists of America, set up tents and tables around the outskirts of the protest at the Michigan State Capitol. | Oct. 18. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.
“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”
Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.
“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.
Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond
Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.
Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue
“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.
“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.
“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

And scattered among the crowds were volunteers with clipboards, collecting signatures for initiative petition campaigns hoping to make the 2026 ballot. 
“We are just out here trying to make sure that the people hold the power and not politicians,” said Drew Amidei, a staff organizer for Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action, at the Jefferson City rally. 
This was the second nationwide No Kings mass gathering, with the first organized in June to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Since then, Missourians have found more reasons to organize at the state level, said Sue Rodgers, spokesperson for We Stand United Missouri. The organization led the Jefferson City rally at the State Capitol, where hundreds of protesters turned out despite a rainy afternoon.
Sue Gibson, a volunteer with Respect Missouri Voters, collects signatures during the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City on Saturday. Respect Missouri Voters is the intiative petition campaign for a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for the General Assembly to overturn citizen-led ballot measures (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Rogers pointed to last month’s move by Missouri lawmakers to push forward a gerrymandered congressional map requested by Trump and a ballot measure to make it harder for citizens to amend the state’s constitution.
“There’s more specific issues at this point,” Rodgers told The Independent. “We see more evidence of the authoritarian power grabs and executive overreach.”
Even a thunderstorm in St. Louis wasn’t enough to dampen the spirits of protesters. 
“I know it’s raining. I know it’s a little cool,” former Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush told a crowd of more than a thousand people gathered in downtown St. Louis amid the thunderstorm. “But you all, this is nothing in comparison to the reign that we’ll have to live through if we don’t resist the Donald Trump administration.”
 Jefferson City

Rodgers pointed to organizations with tents surrounding the Missouri State Capitol lawn with volunteers collecting signatures for three petition campaigns.
“We definitely have more of a focus this time on the initiative petitions and redistricting,” she said.
A petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan circulated during the demonstration, with groups like Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and Respect Missouri Voters collecting signatures.
To them, the citizen-led petitions embody the spirit of No Kings — with voters asserting power and calling out leadership they believe is acting autocratic.
Women dressed as suffragettes wait to present a timeline of women’s contributions to democracy as part of the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City Saturday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
“No Kings is a good time to get this message out because both this referendum and this rally are really about empowering the people of Missouri,” Amidei said. “It’s really about asserting our democratic values.”
He told The Independent there was a “good amount of foot traffic” as he collected signatures for a petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan.
Organizers wanted voters’ rights to be emphasized while creating an uplifting environment.
“We encouraged them to come in costumes, have fun,” Rodgers said. “Everyone needs a little space to let off anxious energy and find out they are not alone.”
Rodgers was one of a handful of women dressed as suffragettes who spoke during the Jefferson City rally about women’s contributions to democracy.
Another speaker, assistant attorney general Greg Barnes, dressed as James Madison to warn demonstrators of threats to the U.S. Constitution. He spoke about Trump’s mentions of a third term.
But not every costume had an obvious nod to democracy. Others dressed as dinosaurs in inflatable costumes, and one organizer wore a Cheeto costume.
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning, dressed in a cow onesie, told the crowd that the costumes are intentional.
“When we’re silly, we expose them as frauds,” she said. “Fascists can’t promote lies about dangerous, left-wing terrorists when we keep showing up unarmed wearing costumes.”
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning leads chants during the No Kings rally in Jefferson City on Saturday. Browning said the organizers encouraged participants to wear costumes to show their intentions for a peaceful, uplifting event (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Unlike in June, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe did not declare a state of emergency ahead of Saturday’s rallies. At the time, Kehoe said his decision to activate the Missouri National Guard was a “precautionary measure” in the case of “events that are occurring or could occur.”
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said in a statement at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Kehoe is currently being sued by Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, and the son of a Republican state senator, over his decision to activate troops over the summer.
Local news outlets reported that the June protests remained uneventful between demonstrators and police.
 St. Louis 

The crowd at Keiner Plaza in downtown St. Louis brought with it ample American flags, ponchos and an occasional inflatable costume. 
“Fight looks like marching in the streets. Fight looks like collecting signatures,” state Rep. Ray Reed, a Democrat from St. Louis, told the crowd. “ … Fight looks like putting your name on a ballot.”

Brice Bloom-Ellis, 69, of St. Louis, stood several yards away holding a sign demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. But ICE was front of mind. 
“I’m totally opposed to masked federal police snatching people off the street,” said Bloom-Ellis, who works in child welfare. “It’s just unbelievable that that’s happening in this country.” 
He was also appalled by Missouri’s new congressional map, which he called nothing but a “power grab.” 
Bloom-Ellis was far from the only one upset that the governor took the president’s request to redraw the congressional map in favor of Republicans to heart. 
Tullia Hamilton, 77, of St. Louis, said she’s never met Kehoe, but if she did, she knows what she would tell him: 
“I don’t know you, but chances are you’re three times the man Donald Trump is,” said Hamilton, a retired history professor. “Why are you bowing to him? He’s a small person.”

Beside Hamilton stood by her good friend, Dr. Seth Eisen, 84, the director of Washington University’s Clinical Rheumatology Research Program, who brought a sign that read: “hands off science.” 
“It’s really a throw-back for science and also for health care in St. Louis specifically, but in the state and in the nation as well,” said Hamilton, who in recent months has seen NIH funding decreased, studies halted, and colleagues leave academia for the pharmaceutical industry. 
“What’s happening now is going to impact research for 10 years,” he said. “Even if it were to change today.” 
Ryan Maliff, 35, of Webster Groves, who works in health care, is already seeing the impact on Missourians, including his patients who can no longer afford insulin. 
“A lot of what’s been done to gut the protections for Medicare and Medicaid, it’s affecting my work, it’s affecting my patients,” he said.

As the group rounded out its march through downtown, which lasted nearly two hours, Ari Jones-Bradley, 49, said she’s spent the past several months feeling hopeless, alone and terrified for the world her four sons are growing up in.
“We’re headed into extremely dark times, and this is not the country my grandfather fought for,” Jones-Bradley said of her grandfather who served in World War II at the Battle of Iwo Jima. 
But she said Saturday’s demonstration, which she called “electrifying,” shifted something in her. 
“I’m mad,” Jones-Bradley said. “I’m fully energized again and I’m ready to fight.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101825_NoKings7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-18 19:58:27.450897
