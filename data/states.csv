In January, New Mexico environment officials cited the base for a spill of wastewater containing firefighting foam with PFAS which soaked into the aquifer after a retaining pond leaked. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Alexx Mercer)The New Mexico environment and Department of Justice on Monday announced a new lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Air Force seeking redress for PFAS contamination at Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.
Specifically, as delineated in a news release, the suit aims to order the Air Force to:

end all use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at Cannon for anything other than emergency purposes
provide water treatment systems to residents whose water has been affected by PFAS contamination
install drinking water lines for any willing residents currently serviced by private wells in the spill area
hold regular public meetings with the community
install stormwater controls and retention basins to prevent offsite migration of PFAS from contaminated media
evaluate nearby private property affected by PFAS contamination
compensate the owners of such property for losses resulting from PFAS contamination





What are PFAS?
Per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances – aka PFAS – are a class of thousands of manmade chemicals used in waterproofing. They are in everyday items such as cookware or takeout containers and also in fire-fighting foams for aircraft. But the chemicals’ resistance to breaking down from exposure to water, heat and sunlight mean that they are accumulating in the soil and water and in the bodies of animals and people.
Health officials have linked PFAS to health risks such as decreased fertility, immune system damage, lower vaccine effectiveness and increased cancer risks.




In January, New Mexico environment officials issued a nearly $68,000-dollar fine to the Cannon U.S. Air Force Base Tuesday, stating the military had failed to immediately report a 4,000-gallon spill of PFAS into the groundwater in August. Cannon appealed the fine in February.
The new lawsuit follows the enactment of House Bill 140 following the most recent legislative session, which expanded the state’s authority to require cleanup of PFAS. Specifically, New Mexico has argued PFAS was subject to regulation under the Hazardous Waste Act since 2019, but the Air Force disagreed and sued NMED over the issue. HB 140 explicitly designates discarded firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste.
“After years of contesting responsibility, today’s lawsuit puts every one of the Air Force’s excuses to rest,”Environment Department Secretary James Kenney said in a statement regarding the new lawsuit. “The Air Force has spent years contesting the Environment Department’s authority as opposed to any meaningful cleanup of the toxic PFAS contamination in local drinking water sources that serve both residents and dairy farmers.”
Battle between New Mexico and US Air Force to track toxic chemicals drags on

In 2018, outflows from Cannon AFB contaminated water sources with PFAS in 2018 and caused dairy farmers to euthanize thousands of cows.
“PFAS contamination poses a serious and long-term threat to our environment and our communities,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “We are committed to using every legal tool available to hold the federal government accountable for the damage done on the base and the surrounding community and to prevent further harm from these dangerous ‘forever chemicals.’ New Mexicans deserve clean water, safe soil, and a future free from toxic exposure—and we won’t stop fighting until they get it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pfasphoto.jpg,,,2025-06-24 12:13:09.079194

The WGA continues through Tuesday at the Eldorado Hotel with more speakers from the Trump administration. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”

After Helene washed out the two main transmission lines from North Fork and a backup bypass line, the city focused on restoring service as quickly as possible. (Photo provided by City of Asheville’s Water Resources Department)The North Carolina Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee approved a revised version of a House proposal on Tuesday that would halt significant new transfers of surface water, an issue brought forth by Hurricane Helene.
House Bill 850, or “Interbasin Transfer Moratorium/Study,” would place a moratorium on the issuance of certificates for some surface water transfers while the North Carolina Collaboratory studies the issue. The bill passed the House in May by a vote of 108-1.
Primary sponsor Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, he spent a lot of time at the Hickory Regional Airport. Flying along on some rescue missions, he was able to observe the displacement of water around Lake James and the Linville Gorge.
Adams described how floods had scoured both sides of the gorge, pushing the trees and earth into Lake James.
“Lake James had kind of a caramel look to it, whereas it’s normally one of the most pristine lakes in the Catawba River system, so that was very alarming for me to see,” he said.
He began to wonder how much of the capacity of Lake James had been reduced.
In the Catawba River system, reservoirs like Lake James and Lake Norman store water for human use.
“The capacity, in my mind, has unquestionably been reduced, and that’s a very important characteristic of the system for all of us,” Adams said. “That’s the basis for the moratorium: simply asking for more time.”
Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) said she’s originally from Atlanta and is familiar with the debates over water between Georgia and Florida.
She asked how the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County feel about the issue.
“I think they recognize that it’s in their best interest that the system itself altogether be healthy,” Adams said. “They need to know as well what the status is.”
The Senate committee substitute approved Tuesday sets a clear date for the moratorium to end on March 21, 2027. The original bill had simply set a date of six months after the submission of the Collaboratory’s study results.
No members of the general public provided testimony on the bill.
The legislation proceeds to the Senate Rules Committee. If approved by the Senate, it will be returned to the House for concurrence with the Senate changes.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/North-Fork-Reservoir-1024x768.webp,,,2025-06-24 12:13:09.079194

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)Do you remember the shocking images from the Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon oil spills? The oil-slicked birds, the wrecked beaches, the empty fishing boats, and worst of all, the stories of lost lives? The Trump administration wants to bring polluting and dangerous oil and gas offshore drilling back — including to our New England shores. Here at the Conservation Law Foundation, we’re joining a lawsuit to stop this reckless plan.
In the chaos of the first months of the new regime, you’d be forgiven for overlooking this news story, but we can’t let it go unnoticed. In one of the most outrageous moves coming out of the Trump administration, the president has issued a series of executive orders pushing to open our iconic coastal waters to oil and gas drilling.
They want to exploit the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, which make up much of the ocean surrounding the U.S. They want to loosen rules designed to protect the marine environment and the coasts. They even want to review national marine sanctuaries and monuments, the national parks of the sea, to see if we can plant some oil derricks on them as well. That means oil rigs in our lobster grounds. Pipelines cutting through fragile marine sanctuaries. The constant threat of spills on our coasts.
If you’re wondering, “Hey, didn’t Biden ban drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf?” Yes, he did, and no, President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse the ban isn’t legal. That’s what the lawsuit is about. 
Trump claims the U.S. is in an “energy emergency.” Spoiler alert: We’re not. In fact, we’re producing more fossil fuels than ever before. This isn’t about energy security. It’s about handing over our ocean to polluters. This flimsy justification won’t hold up in court, which is why we’ve joined Earthjustice and many other environmental organizations to challenge it.
In the last year alone, climate change has fueled a hurricane that swamped North Carolina, wildfires that leveled whole neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and floods that wiped out Vermont communities. As the environmental, financial, and human costs soar before our eyes, we need to be ramping down our fossil fuel production, not ripping up the seafloor in search of more.
Fossil fuels pose an enormous danger to our climate, but they also pose a more immediate danger to everyone who has to interact with them. One study found that between 1968 and 2011, fossil fuel accidents claimed the lives of almost 5,000 Americans.
Let’s not forget that offshore drilling is a messy, high-risk business. The previously mentioned Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon catastrophes have dominated the news, but in 2003 an oil barge hit rocks off our own Cape Cod coast and dumped 98,000 gallons of oil into the waters of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The oil fouled beaches and marshes and, according to NOAA, killed countless birds while destroying oyster, clam, and fish habitat.
Our ocean is too precious to New England’s way of life to risk with dangerous, unnecessary oil drilling. Offshore drilling destroys seafloor habitats, pollutes our waters, and risks destructive oil spills. A New England ocean littered with oil rigs could mean an end to summer holidays on the beach, our iconic lobster industry, thriving fish populations, and more.
That’s why the Conservation Law Foundation is stepping up to stop the Trump administration’s reckless plan to bring offshore drilling to our shores. We’ve fought attempts to drill in our waters for decades, and we’re not stopping now. 
The Trump administration’s offshore drilling plan is an insult to every New Englander who values our ocean, our way of life, and our future. We will not let anyone turn our coast into another oil-soaked headline.

The Southern Delaware Orchestra (SODELO) is tuning up for a vibrant summer, headlined by a series of concerts titled “A Summer Celebration of America’s Music.”
The performances, taking place in July and August, spotlight some of the nation’s most iconic composers and reflect the orchestra’s ongoing mission to foster a love of orchestral music across Southern Delaware.
The summer series kicks off with two performances: July 19 at Milford High School and July 20 at Cape Henlopen High School, both beginning at 3 p.m.
These concerts will mark a milestone for SODELO, with the Milford performance serving as the orchestra’s debut at the first public high school in Sussex County to offer string education.
Under the baton of internationally acclaimed conductor and cellist Stephen Czarkowski, and featuring Metropolitan Opera soprano Dr. Makeda Hampton, the program will include works by American greats such as Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, John Williams, Richard Rodgers, and Irving Berlin.
“We are truly excited about a program that raises the bar high for the orchestra and features the talents of these amazing guest artists,” said SODELO Co-Founder and Board President Stephen Greifer. “We promise an evening of favorites, plus exploration and discovery, as we stroll through some of the greatest music from some of the most iconic composers this nation has ever produced.”
Tickets for the Cape Henlopen concert are priced at $25 for adults and $10 for students, with free admission for children 10 and under.
At Milford, veterans, students, faculty, and staff will be admitted free of charge as a gesture of welcome to the community.
The orchestra will also take the stage at the Freeman Arts Pavilion on August 12 at 7 p.m., performing selections from the “America’s Music” program. Tickets are $19, with free admission for children 12 and under.
Honoring young musicians
The summer performances will also serve as a send-off for three young violinists embarking on new chapters. Sigrid Evers of Milford High School, who joined SODELO as a freshman in 2022, is heading to Haverford College, while Cape Henlopen graduate Olivia Passwaters will attend Salisbury University.
Shelby Troyer, Salutatorian of Greenwood Mennonite School, plans to pursue nursing through the University of Delaware and Margaret H. Rollins School of Nursing, and will continue performing with SODELO.
“It is the nature of a community orchestra to include performers of all ages and backgrounds,” Greifer said, “and it is a special moment for us to wish Sigrid, Olivia and Shelby great success in the next steps in their lives, education and musical careers.”
Expanding outreach efforts
Beyond the concert hall, SODELO is deepening its educational outreach this summer through a new partnership with the Children’s Beach House in Lewes.
The orchestra’s musicians will offer 25 half-hour sessions to underserved youth, featuring percussion, soprano recorder, dance, singing, and hands-on introductions to orchestral instruments.
Founded in 2022, SODELO began as a 32-member string ensemble and has since grown into a full symphony of 75 volunteer musicians.
Its members include students, teachers, veterans, professionals, and retirees, united by a shared passion for music and community.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania. 










Roofers are right out there where you can see them. 


– Sergio Barajas, National Hispanic Construction Alliance executive director


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

He said blues music can help people through a tough time, and that’s why he keeps coming to the stage night after night.","Blues legend John Primer knew from a young age that he wanted to be a musician.
“When I was two or three years old, I would go around and play that thing,” Primer said. “I always wanted to be a guitar player.”
Primer, born in Mississippi, migrated to Chicago when he was 18-years-old in the early 1960s and quickly found work at local clubs, honing his guitar skills. He performed seven nights a week for seven years at Theresa’s Lounge in south Chicago alongside the Junior Wells Band. There, he sparked the interest of Vicksburg-born bluesman Willie Dixon, which ultimately led Primer to become band leader for the iconic Muddy Waters. 
“When I play with those big guys like that, they’re teaching me,” he said. “I’m in school then, because I’m learning what they’re doing, but I don’t try to be them.”
Now, he’s returning to Mississippi with The Real Deal Blues Band to play at the National Folk Festival held November 7-9 in downtown Jackson.
“Mississippi is my home, so I can’t forget about that,” he said. “It’s where I started.”
Through the years though, he said the music scene has changed around Chicago. He’s worked as a musician for more than six decades and said he’s seen it all. 
“When I got to Chicago in 1963, music was everywhere. Music was in every club in Chicago, now it’s changed. It’s not like it used to be,” he said. “It’s not many clubs like it used to be in the 60s, 70s and 80s. They’re all gone, vanished. They’re very few in Chicago now. A lot has changed.” 
But he said his love for the blues keeps him performing.
“I tell everybody, when I’m playing, I don’t work for money, but I like to get paid. I get up there and play. Thinking about the money? No. Think about the people and my love so people can know the blues, that’s why I play. They keep me going.”
Primer has a career spanning six decades and close to 100 albums. He’s been nominated for three Grammy awards, and has won countless Blues Blast and Blues Music awards. He’s performed all over the world, but he said he’s looking forward to coming home to Mississippi. Looking to the National Folk Festival, Primer said he’s going to play some fan favorites and throw in a couple songs from his recent album “Grown in Mississippi.” 
“I know what the people like, and so I’m going to try to play some of this and some of that for them. Whatever it takes to get the mood going,” he said. 
Blues to Primer is a way of living. He said blues music can help people through a tough time, and that’s why he keeps coming to the stage night after night. 
“Blues help you with your pain. Not physical pain, but if you had a bad night, you lost a loved one or some person passed away,” he said. “A lot of people come to me and say ‘I’ve been having a bad day, but I heard you tonight and I can go home and sleep good. I forgot about the bad feelings.’ Blues makes you forget about your troubles.”

Utah senator says Forest Service lands no longer on the block as parliamentarian finds sell-off violates reconciliation budget rules.
The post Lee cuts scope of Senate public lands sell-off plan amid setbacks, public opposition appeared first on WyoFile .","In the face of mounting bipartisan criticism, Utah Sen. Mike Lee has backed off from a plan to sell Forest Service land at the same time a congressional official concluded his proposal didn’t meet rules to fast-track the federal budget.
Lee, a Republican, had sought to include a “mandatory disposal” provision in the Senate’s reconciliation budget, a measure that would have put 2-3 million acres of public land up for sale in Wyoming and 10 other Western states. The provision, Lee maintained, would help reduce the deficit and supply housing in the West. The reconciliation package can be passed by a simple majority.
But in a post on X Monday evening Lee said he would no longer target U.S. Forest Service lands in the plan forwarded by his Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
His about-face came as a Senate rule-maker — Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough — opined that the 11-page mandatory disposal section didn’t comply with a rule requiring reconciliation measures — the Republican’s One Big, Beautiful Bill in this case — to focus on budget matters.
“We are NOT selling off our forests.” Mike Lee
That means the provision would be subject to protest and a ruling by the presiding senator when the matter is considered by the upper chamber. Measures that are found to violate the rule must be passed by 60 votes, not a simple majority.
In a narrowly divided Senate, that prospect would likely doom the land-sale effort.
“Here’s what I plan to do,” Lee posted. “REMOVE ALL Forest Service land. We are NOT selling off our forests.”
Further, Lee would require lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management to be considered for sale only if they were within five miles of population centers. He would also ensure the lands benefit American families, he said. Critics have worried foreign investors might swoop in on the sales.
Democrats said Monday evening that Republicans continue to violate the rule.
“Today, the Senate Parliamentarian again advised that several provisions in the Republicans’ ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’ would be subject to a 60-vote threshold if they remain in the bill,” Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, posted on the committee’s website.
One of the seven provisions ruled out-of-bounds required mandatory public land sales. “This section mandates the unprecedented sale of millions of acres of public land, including from both Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands,” Democrats said.
Lee’s provision sparked an outburst of opposition as Wyoming residents of all stripes rose up to criticize it. U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, all Republicans, told upset constituents that the Wyoming delegation continued to support President Donald Trump’s agenda.
Criticism of the measure, Hageman wrote, amounts to “an effort to control these lands to ensure our amenities are used solely by the independently wealthy, who have little concern as to whether there is affordable housing available for the people who seek to make their lives in places like Kemmerer or Green River or Pinedale.”
But Democrats have countered that it is the Republican public lands plan that would benefit the wealthy at the expense of average Americans.
“Democrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,” Merkley said in a statement.“Democrats continue to show up and fight every provision of this Big, Beautiful Betrayal of a bill, because this bill is an attack on workers and families everywhere,” he stated. “We will make sure the Byrd Rule is followed and review any changes Republicans attempt to make.”

Andrea Campbell and three other blue state attorneys general took to Washington on Monday to describe their ongoing fight against Trump administration policies in court.
The post In Washington, Campbell defends states’ efforts against Trump’s executive overreach appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE FIREHOSE OF Trump administration actions has not slowed down one bit since blue state attorneys general last month touted their efforts to push back on what they see as dramatic executive overreach.  
Speaking before a group of Democratic members of Congress on Monday, the top state prosecutors from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, and New Jersey laid out their litany of lawsuits over the last six months. A coalition of about two dozen Democratic attorneys general have fought the administration, often in New England federal courts, over issues including National Institutes of Health funding for medical research, the ability of Harvard University to enroll foreign students and defend its tax status, consumer protection policy, endangered green energy options like offshore wind, and immigration policy including birthright citizenship. 
Campbell identified both birthright citizenship and the due process violations of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement as two major areas of concern. 
Both Tufts doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and Milford High School student Marcelo Gomes da Silva were arrested off the streets by federal agents, who Campbell noted were masked and unidentified.  
“ICE and local authorities would have you or have us believe that they were doing it all to promote public safety, which is total nonsense,” Campbell said. “They were doing it to create fear in our communities and they’re continuing to do that.” 
Along with filing lawsuits, Campbell said she and other state authorities have put out guidance for people on what to expect in interactions with ICE, as well as connecting them with attorneys. While Öztürk and Gomes have been released, Campbell said, their cases indicate a troubling indifference to the due process rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment and the rights of free expression. 
The “spotlight forum” was a joint hearing brought by Democratic US representatives and senators. Without control over either chamber of Congress, the series of subject-specific special hearings is something of an attempt to highlight Democratic action at a time when the president is wielding executive power in ways that may infringe on the “power of the purse” granted to Congress by the country’s founding documents. 
Exercises of presidential authority, in any given administration, often prompt a deeply partisan response. As was the case in May, with a gathering of New England attorneys general, Campbell told lawmakers “sadly it is only Democratic AGs that are standing up in this moment in time.” 
While congressional Republicans have largely backed President Donald Trump’s actions on tariffs, budget slashing, and broadsides against diversity initiatives, some disagreement is rising around the president’s decision to involve the United States in military strikes against Iran without congressional approval. 
This leaves state attorneys general with a heavy responsibility, lawmakers said.  
Attorneys general and lawmakers noted that the Trump administration has received blistering ruling from judges appointed by both parties, including Reagan appointee US District Judge John Coughenour, who blocked the president’s order purporting to end birthright citizenship for children of parents in the country illegally.  
 “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,” Coughenour told a Justice Department attorney. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” 
Another Reagan nominee, US District Judge William Young, last week ordered the National Institutes of Health to reinstate hundreds of research grants slashed centered around themes of gender and sexuality, Covid-19 and vaccines for the disease, or health disparities.  
Campbell said she is careful about “defining how we’re winning, because I never want to discount the real harm that people are suffering and experiencing.” 
A missed clinical trial can mean life or death for a patient, she said. The damage caused by funding cuts, attacks on medical and higher education institutions, and trade uncertainty ripple out into the broader Massachusetts economy, Campbell added, noting the impact on people’s ability to live and receive care. 
Massachusetts General Brigham is the largest recipient of NIH funding, Campbell said, and has had to make significant program cuts. The cuts are impacting research on antibodies, she said, and halting clinical trials. 
The lower courts have stalled some of the sweeping presidential actions, which some Republicans claim is an unacceptable use of judicial power, but the end result once the Supreme Court weighs in on Trump’s actions is far from certain.  
As the attorneys general testified, the Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling lifting an order from Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell federal officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination.  
Laid out before them, the four state prosecutors said, is a broad attack on the rule of law.  At stake are a functioning economy and a responsive government. 
Explaining the magnitude of the attacks is critical, Campbell said.  
“I’ve been telling folks, regardless of how you feel about the 14th amendment, pick the amendment that you like,” she said, “because they can come after that one too.”

The notice came on the three-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, and ended nearly 50 years of a constitutional right to an abortion. 
It also follows a decision earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to rescind guidance that emphasized hospitals are responsible for providing emergency abortion care despite state bans, saying it does not reflect the Trump administration’s policy.
“Due to recent federal action taken and guidance issued, the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs reminds you that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) remains in force, including its requirement to provide screening and appropriate follow up care,” the notice stated. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said the decision to rescind the guidance will place thousands of lives at risk by restricting women’s ability to access appropriate emergency health care. 
“Here in Michigan, we believe everyone deserves the freedom to make their own decisions about their reproductive health,” Whitmer said in a press release. “We trust women to make decisions that are right for their bodies, lives, and futures. I’ll keep fighting like hell to protect your freedoms.” 
 The notice makes clear to Michigan hospitals that the state’s authority on reproductive health issues is not preempted by decisions made by the federal government. It also says that while state-licensed health facilities and agencies aren’t required to admit patients for the purpose of performing an abortion, they “are still required to offer adequate and appropriate care for the services they provide.”
In its press release, Whitmer’s office states that by not enforcing the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, the Trump administration is “providing cover to hospitals systems that have ideological opposition to abortions, putting the life of the mother at risk in the process.”
 Meanwhile, reproductive rights advocates note that in the three years since Roe was overturned, more than 20 states have severely restricted or placed outright bans on access to abortion. Combined with a lack of clarity around the responsibilities of hospitals in those states to provide appropriate care, those advocates say the result has been a number of preventable deaths.
“Knowing this, the Trump administration still revoked Biden-era guidance around lifesaving emergency care, making their stance as clear as ever: when faced with a life or death situation, they do not care if pregnant people die,” Paula Thornton Greear, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Michigan, said.
Whitmer also expects that Trump’s decision to rescind the federal guidance will result in additional residents in states like neighboring Indiana that have abortion bans to seek reproductive health care in Michigan. That could place a strain on resources and potentially limit the services offered by Michigan hospitals, Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8331-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 11:21:27.191450

Hortman will be the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol. The public may pay their respects from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, the office of Gov. Tim Walz announced Tuesday.
A private funeral will be held on Saturday, but it will be livestreamed.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Three-time former Newport mayor and current city council member Jeanne-Marie Napolitano faces a $1,000 fine for violating state campaign finance laws over the last year.
The Rhode Island Board of Elections voted to approve a consent agreement with Napolitano at its June 17 meeting, following results of a subpoena and audit of her campaign finance account. Napolitano, a Democrat who has served nearly 30 years as a Newport city official, misreported or failed to report roughly $6,000 in combined campaign donations and spending from Jan. 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, according to the state election board’s audit. That includes more than $1,000 in cash contributions from sources who were not identified, and more than $3,200 in donations that were misreported or not reported at all.

Napolitano also used $110 from her campaign for personal use, and accepted a separate, $3,000 contribution from one donor — exceeding the $2,000-per-person per-year donation cap in state law.
Under the June 6 agreement with the elections board, Napolitano will pay a $1,000 fine, due no later than Sept. 30. She also must forfeit $2,025 from her campaign account within the next 30 days, based on failure to disclose sources of cash contributions, and exceeding the annual donation cap on a separate, individual donation.
Napolitano did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday. However, she took “full responsibility” for the violations during the board’s review, according to its audit report. Napolitano told state campaign finance staffers that she tried to handle her campaign account herself after her treasurer resigned, but it was “over her head,” the report stated.
She turned in the required information to the state elections board to complete her incorrect and incomplete campaign finance statements in May, according to the audit report.
Napolitano is a long-time fixture in city politics. She served two years on the city council from 1991 to 1995, returning again after 1999. She has won re-election in every subsequent term, and, as the top vote-getter in council elections, served three terms as city mayor, most recently from 2020 to 2022.
In 2024, Napolitano was the fourth highest vote-getter in the non-partisan race for the council’s four at-large seats, securing 14.5% of the vote.

The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has issued a formal Notice of Violation (NOV) to the Delaware City Refining Company following an unpermitted emissions incident that occurred on March 13, 2025.
According to DNREC, the violation stems from the refinery’s release of more than 260,000 pounds of carbon monoxide and over 38,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide during a 10-hour period when its carbon monoxide boiler—a key pollution control device—was offline.
The breakdown occurred during a routine equipment maintenance operation, resulting in untreated flue gas bypassing the emissions control system.
Visible black smoke, exceeding permitted opacity levels, was also released.
The NOV cites the refinery for discharging air contaminants without a permit and failing to operate required control equipment as outlined in its air permit.
The agency said the emissions and violations were first reported to the Delaware Environmental Release Notification System (DERNS) on the day of the incident.

The March event is separate from another emissions issue currently under investigation. Between May 26 and June 12, the refinery reportedly released unpermitted sulfur dioxide emissions for 19 consecutive days.
That incident also involved a malfunction of the carbon monoxide boiler, this time caused by a water-tube leak.
Emissions violation process
An NOV is part of the multi-stage DNREC enforcement process that can include:

An initial report or notice of environmental release, which for an industrial facility can mean emissions believed to be over reportable or permitted limits
An environmental investigation, including collection of emissions data and investigation into cause of the incident
A Notice of Violation, which formally documents DNREC’s understanding of the facts, background and a description of a violation
A Notice of Administrative Penalty Assessment, proposing a monetary penalty based on the severity and duration of the violation.
A Notice of Conciliation, prescribing specific actions a facility has agreed to take to return to compliance.
A DNREC Secretary’s Order, requiring corrective measures to be completed by a set deadline.
A possible appeal by a facility of DNREC’s NOV, requirements or penalties, which by law can go to the Environmental Appeals Board and to state court.

The refinery may appeal the NOV or any future penalties through the state’s Environmental Appeals Board or in court.
More information on the violation and the ongoing investigation can be found on the Delaware Environmental Navigator, DNREC’s public database for environmental compliance records.
The Delaware City refinery has a capacity of 180,000 barrels per day and a high complexity rating of 13.6, enabling it to process a wide range of heavy, high-sulfur crude oils.
Located on a 5,000-acre site along the Delaware River, it receives crude via rail and water and distributes refined products through pipelines, barges, tankers, trucks, and rail. It is one of the largest and most complex refineries on the U.S. East Coast.

Mike Braun announced. (Getty Images)Indiana’s 15 public colleges and universities will freeze in-state undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees for the next two academic years, Gov. Mike Braun announced Monday morning.
The Republican governor called the move a “historic” step toward making higher education more affordable.
The freeze applies to all flagship and regional campuses across the state and will keep costs flat through the 2026-2027 academic year. 










The commitment made by all of Indiana’s public colleges and universities puts students and parents first and demonstrates to the rest of the country that Indiana is a leader in providing a high quality education at an affordable price.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


That includes Ball State University; Indiana State University; Indiana University’s Bloomington, East, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Kokomo, Northwest, South Bend and Southeast campuses; Ivy Tech Community College; Purdue’s West Lafayette, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Northwest campuses; University of Southern Indiana; and Vincennes University.
It marks the first time since at least 2010 that more than two Hoosier campuses have simultaneously frozen tuition — and the first time ever that all state colleges and universities have done so at once, according to Braun’s office.
“A month ago, we challenged our state’s public higher education institutions to find efficiencies, eliminate redundancies and identify ways to streamline services without compromising quality,” Braun said in a statement. “The commitment made by all of Indiana’s public colleges and universities puts students and parents first and demonstrates to the rest of the country that Indiana is a leader in providing a high quality education at an affordable price.”
Schools can still raise rates for room and board, however, and some institutions will additionally raise attendance costs for international students.
Higher education costs in the spotlight
The tuition freeze came at Braun’s request, just weeks after he signed Indiana’s next two-year state budget, which takes effect July 1. 
Under state law, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE) must issue tuition recommendations within 30 days of the budget’s approval. Typically, each university system sets its own tuition schedule, which is approved by CHE. 
But last month, commissioners instead announced their unanimous support for the governor’s recommendation to implement the 0% increase. It was the first such recommendation ever made by the higher education panel.



“While the Commission, along with our institutions and other partners, have leveraged policies, programs, and partnerships to keep our colleges and universities affordable, we all recognize the economic challenges our fellow Hoosiers have faced over the past several years,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “In the spirit of seeking to maintain Indiana’s national leadership in affordability, the Commission is in full support of Gov. Braun’s recommendation for a 0% tuition increase.” 
The announcement also comes amid growing national concern over the cost of college and rising student debt. While Indiana’s tuition rates are generally lower than other states, scrutiny about affordability has increased.
CHE officials reported last year that nearly 70% of Hoosier undergraduates receive some form of financial aid — but out-of-pocket expenses remain a barrier, particularly for first-generation and low-income students.

Facing a weak state revenue forecast, state agencies and universities — were hit with funding cuts of at least 5%, plus an additional 5% reduction in reversions. 
Braun defended the freeze, however, noting that state colleges and universities are well-positioned to absorb reductions.
“Out of all state entities, our higher education institutions are in the best financial position to weather these cuts, as state funding represents just one of the revenue streams — and institutions hold strong financial reserves,” Braun said in May. 
“Higher education institutions should address the reductions in the same way as other state entities: by refocusing on their core missions, finding efficiencies, eliminating redundancies, and identifying ways to streamline the delivery of higher education,” he continued. 
Braun pointed to success at Purdue University, where tuition and mandatory fees have stayed flat for 14 years while still “delivering successfully on (the institution’s) core mission.” 
New policy already taking effect
Across the state, campuses had already started putting the governor’s plan into action.
Ivy Tech Community College, Indiana’s largest postsecondary system by enrollment, approved its freeze earlier this month. The two-year college system has over 40 locations statewide.
At their June 12 meeting, Indiana University trustees confirmed a tuition freeze at the Bloomington flagship, as well as at campuses in Indianapolis, Kokomo, Richmond, Gary, South Bend and New Albany.
Commissioners preview changing higher education landscape

Purdue University additionally announced this month that it will maintain its longstanding freeze at the West Lafayette campus. Regional campuses in Fort Wayne and Northwest will also keep tuition flat.
Indiana State University, which has faced enrollment challenges in recent years, will participate in the tuition freeze while continuing efforts to grow its student base.
University of Southern Indiana (USI) and Vincennes University will both hold rates steady, too. 
USI student Samantha Fleischaker, who serves on the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, said in a statement that the decision will make college more accessible for families across the state.
“Keeping tuition flat keeps the door open for students of all backgrounds, all ZIP codes, and all walks of life,” Fleischaker said. “It’s not just a number. It’s the difference between opportunity and what feels impossible.”
Ball State University in Muncie will hold base undergraduate tuition steady, but school officials said room and board costs will increase slightly.
It’s not yet clear if other institutions will also raise ancillary charges, like for housing or program-specific fees.
Several institutions are further planning increases for non‑residents and international students. Purdue, for example, is raising international student fees by $500 per semester and implementing a 3% annual tuition increase for non‑resident and international undergraduates at its regional campuses starting this fall.

Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) addresses the upper chamber on May 7, 2025. (By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent. 
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.” 
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition. 
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.” 
A lifelong Mainer, Bennett currently serves as Oxford County’s senator, a term he plans to finish in 2026 to total 18 combined years of nonconsecutive service in the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, including formerly serving as Senate president. He’s vied for higher office before. Running as a Republican, Bennett narrowly lost a bid for Maine’s 2nd Congressional district in 1994 and a primary race for U.S. Senate in 2012.
He then went on to chair the Maine Republican Party from 2013 to 2016, casting a vote for President Donald Trump the year of his exit as the party’s elector. 
But his votes in the Legislature in recent years position him as one of the most bipartisan legislators. 
Bennett said he doesn’t think he’s changed his views much throughout his time in public office. Rather, he thinks the Republican Party, and politics more broadly, has embraced a toxicity that detracts from what he sees as the most pressing issues facing the state: declining quality education, a lack of access to health care particularly in rural areas and affordable housing. 
“A lot of the energizing elements in the Republican Party are not what I think respond to the needs of a lot of Maine people,” he said. 
Bennett offered a similar critique amid the state budget debate in March.
One of two Republicans to vote for a proposed change package that sought to address the urgent MaineCare deficit, Bennett told Maine Morning Star at the time that he was concerned about the growing demand for fidelity in politics entering Maine. 
“There’s an element in the Republican Party and the Republican caucuses that is sort of feeding off the chaos and disruptive energies of Donald Trump,” Bennett said, “and it’s really not a good thing to see.” 
That supplemental budget ultimately failed after opposition from others in his caucus who refused to back it without structural reform to the program, which is Maine’s version of Medicaid. Later in March, Bennett voted against the two-year budget, as well as the addition passed last week. However, he was a rare voice among Republicans in not objecting to the budget being something largely crafted and advanced by Democrats, the majority party.
“We think about these things in partisan terms far too much,” he said in March. “I object to this budget because it represents a dramatic failing of the Legislature to do its job.” 
Reiterating the reform he’s long pushed for, Bennett said in an interview ahead of announcing his gubernatorial bid that, if elected, he would push for the Legislature to overhaul its budget process, specifically by building in opportunities to re-evaluate baseline spending, which the budget plan passed in March continued as is. 
A record of crossing party lines 
While ultimately joining Republicans in opposing the budget plans for the next biennium, Bennett is no stranger to bucking his party. 
Recently, he joined Democrats in voting against a bill to ban transgender girls from playing girls sports or using girls bathrooms or locker rooms, as well as a slate of other proposals that sought to roll back protections for trans Mainers. 
While stating that he was initially unsure how he would vote, Bennett said in a speech on the Senate floor that he shared the proposals with his daughter, Abby, describing her as an accomplished athlete. 
“Her response was simple and struck me deeply,” Bennett said. “She said, ‘These bills make me sad.’ Her feelings gave me permission to be honest about mine too. I feel sadness that these are before us… I’m saddened by the hardening of silos and the temptation to stigmatize those who are different.”
Bennett also joined Democrats in voting for a bill to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, specifically raising concern that municipalities would be on the hook to pay for their local police taking on federal immigration enforcement work, expanding their legal risk with no compensation.
“I, for one, am concerned about the use of Maine resources and the taking of those resources for activities that are governed by whatever party is in the White House,” he said on the Senate floor. “We need to focus on Maine.”  
Bennett has championed the Wabanaki Nations’ push for state recognition of their sovereignty, sweeping reform that current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has opposed. He’s also taken interest in laying the groundwork for a four-day work week and eliminating daylight saving time, though such a change would be contingent on federal approval. 
Bennett has also advocated for significant campaign finance reform, which, as he put it, is “unfortunately one of the things that the Republicans and Democrats agree on in Augusta.”
This year, the Legislature rejected a bill Bennett proposed to offer Mainers transparency regarding who spends money in elections by requiring political action committees to disclose their donors over $5,000. The proposal was based on an Arizona law that has already been tested in and held up by the courts.
In 2023, Bennett also chaired the ballot question committee for a referendum Maine voters passed to ban companies from spending money on referendum campaigns if they are partially owned by a foreign government or entity. He also supported the referendum passed last year to place a $5,000 limit on super PACs, which are independent political action committees that can currently raise and spend unlimited funds. 
However, both of those reforms were blocked as legal battles play out in the courts. 
While Bennett has previously run his campaigns under the Maine Clean Elections Act, which offers full public financing of political campaigns, he said he will not be doing so for his gubernatorial bid, noting the currently inadequate funding for the program and higher qualifying contribution requirements for governor that he sees as difficult to achieve without the backing of a political party. 
A bill the Legislature passed, which Bennett supported, could also change how Mainers cast their votes in the gubernatorial race in 2026. It currently awaits the governor’s approval. 
LD 1666 would expand ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, for general and special elections for governor and state legislators. RCV is currently used for federal elections and gubernatorial and state-level primary elections in Maine. 
“I wasn’t wild about ranked-choice voting but the voters of Maine said twice that they want it,” Bennett said, referring to Mainers initially voting the system into law and later expanding it. “So, I have been supporting it and trying to make it work.” 
Though, Bennett declined to comment on how he thinks the expansion of this voting method would impact the governor’s race. 
The Republicans currently running for governor are state Sen. James Libby of Cumberland, Robert Charles of Bangor, who worked in the federal government during the George W. Bush administration, Navy veteran Steven Christopher Sheppard, also of Bangor, Kenneth Capron of Portland, David John Jones of Falmouth, Owen McCarthy of Gorham, 
Democratic contenders include Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson and the children of two of Maine’s current members of Congress, Hannah Pingree, also the former head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, and Angus King III.
There is also one other unenrolled candidate so far, Alexander Kenneth Murchison of Dover Foxcroft.

(Dylan Freedom/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A change in state law allows Kansans to buy and sell fireworks for two weeks before Independence Day, but local ordinances still restrict when they can be set off.
The Legislature expanded the previous nine-day window for fireworks sales earlier this year. Retailers can now sell fireworks from June 20 to July 7.
Mark Engholm, the state fire marshal, encouraged Kansans to be cautious about using fireworks and to check city and county rules before purchasing or discharging fireworks.
“Also, as Kansans prepare to celebrate Independence Day, I want to emphasize the importance of using fireworks safely and responsibly,” Engholm said.
Lawmakers for years have entertained proposals to allow year-round fireworks sales. This year, they expanded the window as part of a package of legislation bundled into Senate Bill 199 at the end of the session.
The House passed the bill by a 68-53 vote, followed by a 28-12 vote in the Senate. Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bill into law on April 8.
The owner of Jakes Fireworks and the principal of a Catholic school in Wichita, where fireworks sales are an annual fundraiser, testified in support of expanding the window for legal sales, which previously was June 27 to July 5. The legislation also allows for “permanent retailers” to operate from “permanent structures,” as opposed to seasonal retailers with pop-up tents.
Engholm testified the bill would result in more injuries and losses to fire each year. A private citizen testified against the bill because fireworks can be a trigger for those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Other provisions in the bill designate a memorial near the Kansas Firefighters Museum in Wichita as the Fallen Firefighters Memorial of Kansas and establish a Kansas Firefighters Memorial Council.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1257438377-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 11:21:27.191450

PEORIA — For 60 years, SkillsUSA Illinois has held workforce development competitions for young people entering the trades. For 60 years, there has never been an all-female team competing in the architecture and construction team competition.

Until now, that is.

This April, students competed at the Peoria Civic Center in a bid to showcase their trades work skills, from barbering and cosmetics to house building and fixing cars. First-place winners in the Illinois competition earned eligibility to travel to Atlanta to compete in the national SkillsUSA Championships this week.

Amid the fanfare and cheer, however, the state competition highlighted some of the persistent challenges facing the Illinois workforce. As employers continue searching for skilled tradespeople to combat national worker shortages, entry into fields like construction remains strikingly low for women and people of color, particularly in higher paying and leadership positions.

SkillsUSA Illinois’ first all-girls team — Aubrey Levin, Kayhl Miles, Catelin Wesley and team captain Amyla Walls — did not know they were breaking boundaries until after they had finished their competition this spring in Peoria.

The team from the Bloomington Area Career Center reacted to the news with shocked laughter, followed by near immediate dread as they anticipated the heightened expectations and scrutiny of their work this title would bring.

“They’re going to be like, ‘You’re the first all-female team,’ and I’m going to be like, ‘Please don’t look at my electrical,’” Levin said, half laughing.

Although it may seem late for the existence of the first all-female team, it is consistent with the construction industry demographic trends in Illinois. Over the past 10 years, women have held fewer than one in 10 construction jobs. Prior to 2021, fewer than 5% of new construction apprentices in Illinois were women, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

The problem is a national one. Although 2020 saw the largest number of women working in trades, only one in 20 U.S. construction workers was a woman, according to a report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.

Male construction workers were also better compensated than female construction workers in 2024, even for entry-level apprenticeship positions. New male apprentices earned an average wage of $23.76 per hour, 36 cents more than the average pay for their female counterparts.

The discrepancy grew for those who completed their apprenticeships, with an average hourly gender pay gap of $1.41.

Participation rates for workers of color also remained low, with white apprentices accounting for over three quarters of new registered apprenticeships in 2024.

Apprentices of color earn less on average than white apprentices, both at entry and completion. In 2024, newly registered Black apprentices earned on average 36 cents less in hourly wages than their white counterparts. For those who completed apprenticeships, the gap grew to almost $4 per hour.

As limited as the progress is, much of it has come in the last few years, according to Jayne Vellinga, executive director of the non-profit Chicago Women in Trades.

Vellinga attributes the momentum to “a perfect storm” of an expected construction boom and worker shortage, infrastructure investment and federal leadership on diversity initiatives.

“It did get people to think sort of outside the box in terms of how they were going to recruit a sufficient workforce to meet a large number of projects projected to come to the area and the retirement of experienced workers,” Vellinga said.

Since 2021, the state has invested heavily in the Illinois Works pre-apprenticeship program, which seeks to create a “qualified talent pipeline of diverse candidates in the construction and building trades.” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office announced an additional $19 million funding allocation to the program in April.

However, Vellinga said she is seeing a rollback in progress, pointing to President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind an executive order that  had been in place since enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, which prohibited federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.

“I don’t know how it’s going to impact opportunities for women, but there is definitely a change in narrative also at the federal level, from ‘we need diversity on publicly funded projects’ to ‘don’t engage in diversity, equity and inclusion activities,’” Vellinga said.

In addition to outright hiring discrimination, Vellinga said many women’s careers are limited by gender stereotypes and harassment on job sites.

“Some women are doing well and are having an opportunity to move up, and other women do face discrimination, are unable to cobble together enough work during the year to make it a viable career, or perhaps the works site is so hostile that they walk away from it,” Vellinga said.

The hostility is something that the team of high schoolers was already familiar with.

As SkillsUSA Illinois’ first all-girls team spent two days using their carpentry, roofing, electrical and plumbing skills to build a small house, they were subjected to disparaging, gender-based comments, which the team diplomatically referred to as “construction language.”

It is not something unique to this competition, they said. Levin recalled asking women in the construction unions about their advice on entering tradework. They told her she would need to have thick skin.

“Even now?” Levin asked. Especially now, they replied.

The team described their male peers making jokes with double meanings, and then getting irritated if the girls did not laugh.

“You’re like a bad person for not laughing at a really bad joke,” Miles said.

One such joke came at Levin’s expense, while she was standing on a ladder and trying not to cry from pain after being hit in the back by something on site. A team nearby pointed and laughed at her, she said. A teacher walked by and told Levin to let it out if she needed to.

“Not here,” Levin said. “You can’t cry, because then you’re soft.”

On the other hand, if they got mad, Levin said, a male peer would inevitably ask, “What, are you on your period or something?”

The girls said they are held to a higher standard, as any sign of emotion will be used to prove that they are incapable of matching their male peers. If they stop for a second, they will be called lazy or asked whether they broke a nail, the team said. The job requires a strong poker face, Miles added.

And, Walls said, their judgment is constantly called into question. She recounted a male peer repeatedly correcting her and speaking to her like a child, before eventually concluding she was correct all along.

A national survey of women exiting the trades found that the most common reason women left the trades was due to harassment and lack of respect; nearly half of those who left or had strong intentions to leave marked this as their reason for doing so. Over a quarter of women in the study also indicated that they frequently or always saw sexually explicit and racist graffiti; a fifth responded the same for anti-semitic graffiti.

The second most common reason for exiting, selected by over 40% of those with strong intentions to leave, was a lack of prospects for promotion and advancement. The least selected option was that the work was too physically demanding.

The perception that women are less competent exacerbates other structural barriers to employment, according to Manny Rodriguez, executive director of the Chicago-based nonprofit Revolution Workshop, which offers workforce development programs targeted at communities of color who have been underrepresented in the trades.

Construction is a tough business for anyone, Rodriguez said. A recent paper by the RAND Corporation found that almost 40% of apprentices drop out of their programs before completion, regardless of race or gender, with almost half of those dropping out in the first six months.

Part of the issue is stability of work, such as making it through the cold season when opportunities for new construction projects dip, according to Rodriguez.

“In the wintertime, you can’t pour concrete. You can’t weld. If the structure is not already up, you pretty much got to wait until spring,” Rodriguez said.

Employer biases mean that women and people of color may be hired for jobs, but not retained for the next one, resulting in more instability for those workers, Rodriguez said. As a result, apprenticeship completion rates for women and people of color are even lower.

In 2023, women accounted for 4.5% of U.S. construction apprentices, but 6% of cancellations, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. A study by The Institute for Construction Employment Research found that over the last two decades, around two-thirds of Black construction apprentices did not complete their programs.

Hispanic workers have maintained a high share of workforce participation in the construction industry, but often in lower paying, physically intensive roles, resulting in higher rates of both fatal and nonfatal injuries on the job.

“Latinos are represented in construction, but where?” Rodriquez asked. “I’m not the electrician, I’m not the plumber, I’m not the heavy equipment operator, I’m not the pipe fitter. So you got no problem breaking my brown body, but you’re not letting me do the other things.”

Many women and people of color who do make it in construction attribute their success, at least in part, to having others who look like them in the field.

In the survey of tradeswomen, almost two thirds of respondents identified mentorship from senior tradeswomen as important to their recruitment and advancement. It was something the all-girls team said was valuable as well.

“If we passed a construction site, and they were working, I always got excited when I saw a girl,” said Miles. “I was happy about it, because I’m like, I’m not the only one who actually enjoys this.” Other members of the team agreed.

But Walls, the only Black member of the team, sees fewer women in construction who look like her.

“I don’t see a lot of women, let alone,Black women, doing construction,” Walls said. “I wish I had someone to relate to.”

That is part of the reason why breaking this barrier was important, for the girls on the team and for those who will come after them.

“It doesn’t matter if we win,” Wesley said. “The fact that we have taken a step like this for us, but also for other females in the trades, it’s a huge deal.”

Vendors at Broadacres Marketplace, a decades-old swap meet in North Las Vegas that caters largely to the Latino community, were told to close their shops at 9 a.m. Saturday and that the market would remain closed until further notice.
The market said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution and concern” for its vendors, customers, and staff.
“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business or for us to be a beacon of shopping and entertainment while our federal government is raiding businesses and detaining its people,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.
The move comes after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a major raid at the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet in California on June 14. The Los Angeles Times reported that dozens of agents in tactical gear with guns searched the site and detained several people as multiple helicopters circled overhead.
Following the immigration raid in Santa Fe Springs, Broadacres assured shoppers that the retail space does not cooperate with ICE or similar federal agencies, but warned that federal agents could legally enter the market “without prior notice, permission, or a warrant.”
“While we cannot control the actions of outside agencies we remain fully committed to creating a space where all people feel welcome, respected, and protected,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.
But the Santa Fe Springs raid and ongoing immigration enforcement in Las Vegas appeared to have a chilling effect. 
On Friday, the day before Broadacres officially shuttered, vendors and customers noted on social media the typically bustling open-air market was nearly empty. Only a fraction of the usual customers could be seen shopping Friday despite a discounted $1 entry fee. (Broadacres normally charges a $3 entry fee Friday nights.)
The closure leaves hundreds of vendors and employees with a significant loss of income, and no set date for a return.
“Targeting community spaces like Broadacres doesn’t make anyone safer; it only disrupts and threatens the lives of hardworking immigrant families and businesses,” said Marina Hernandez, a Broadacres vendor who runs a portrait studio, in a statement.
For nearly 50 years Broadacres has been a major economic and cultural hub for North Las Vegas. Open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, vendors sell everything from piñatas and street food to construction gear and washing machines.
Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada, attracting more than 15,000 people every weekend. It’s one of the largest employers in the City of North Las Vegas, according to data from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training & Rehabilitation.
City of North Las Vegas Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown on Monday issued a statement saying she was “saddened” by the closure, adding that the market is “a cornerstone of our local economy and culture.”
Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto on social media criticized President Donald Trump for “indiscriminately targeting immigrant communities.” 
“These are innocent Nevadans working hard to build a better life,” read the post. “This president’s campaign of intimidation is cruel and un-American.”
Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada and a civil rights attorney, said one of his former clients who runs a shop at Broadacres called him Saturday after she was told the market would close indefinitely.
“She’s concerned about the economic impact of Broadacres shutting down. That’s how she supports herself and her family,” Haseebullah said. 
About a decade ago, Haseebullah’s own family ran a booth at Broadacres, where they promoted their independent pharmacy during a moment of economic uncertainty. The economic stability of hundreds of employees and vendors at Broadacres is now at risk as large-scale immigration sweeps create a chilling effect in immigrant communities, said Haseebullah.
“It’s not surprising at all to me that people are fearful,” Haseebullah said. “The fear that we’re seeing in Nevada right now is well founded, because people do not feel a sense of support from the federal government, and they don’t feel a sense of support from our governor.”
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to a request for comment on the closure of one of the largest private employers in North Las Vegas.
As immigration enforcement operations continue in Las Vegas, the Nevada Immigrant Coalition urged immigrants “to know their rights, develop family preparedness plans, and be aware of ICE officers in plainclothes and unmarked vehicles.”
 
Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE in recent weeks to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record has risen sharply since January, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
Reports of U.S. citizens getting  detained for ICE have also made the headlines in several states, including Nebraska, Florida, and Arizona.
In Nevada, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department renewed its 287(g) partnership with ICE earlier this month, which deputizes police to carry out immigration duties.
“People are legitimately afraid to leave their homes, and that is evident by Broadacres closing,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who chairs the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus. “The Trump administration’s enforcement tactics are not just targeting our communities. They are actively, in real time, destabilizing entire communities.”
González said the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus tried to provide immigrant communities some sense of security through a number of bills during the legislative session, including Assembly Bill 217 which would have limited the access of immigration officials to school grounds and records without a court order or warrant. Lombardo vetoed the bill.
“We as a caucus tried to be proactive by responding to the community’s real-time fears. That is our job as elected officials, to bring forth the issues and concerns of our constituencies,” González said. 
In his veto message, Lombardo said the bill was “well-intentioned but fundamentally overbroad” and risked turning “school grounds into sanctuary zones at all times.”
“We met with his office multiple times, and he never once brought this concern up or made any suggestions,” González said. “The lack of empathy. It’s more than disappointing.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio House Democrats have elected Dani Isaacsohn, a Cincinnati lawyer, as their next minority leader. A full chamber vote is scheduled for Wednesday to make him official.
Isaacsohn, a 36-year-old representing the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods, is set to replace Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, as she steps down to allow new leadership to prepare for the midterms. She is term-limited after this General Assembly and is expected to announce her next move in the coming months.
The other leadership positions for the House Dems have changed, as well. If the full floor vote follows the caucus vote — state Rep. Phil Robinson, D-Solon, will be assistant leader, state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, will be whip, and state Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, will be assistant whip.
The millennial lawmaker Isaacsohn has risen to the top of the party since joining the legislature in 2023. He has been the whip since 2024 and is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. He also sits on the Finance and Energy committees. He focuses on affordable housing, education, government transparency and criminal justice reform.
He is a small business owner and created an organization called Cohear, focusing on community engagement. He attended Georgetown and received his law degree from Yale.
Isaacsohn will be one of the first Jewish leaders in state history. He helped create the Ohio Jewish Caucus, which includes five other legislators, including Brown Piccolantonio.

 The future of the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank came under intense scrutiny Monday night as members of City Council’s Community Development & Urban Planning Committee clashed over whether to dissolve the entity,  and whether one of their own is being removed from the committee for demanding accountability.
The proposed ordinance, sponsored by Councilmember Shané Darby, would revoke the city’s authorization of the land bank, citing long-standing concerns about financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, and insider conflicts.
But the debate quickly veered into deeper controversy when Councilmember Coby Owens revealed he is being removed from the committee, and claimed it’s retaliation for his criticism of the land bank.
“This is probably going to be my last Community Development & Urban Planning meeting,” Owens said. “They went behind closed doors, had a meeting to remove me. They didn’t answer my questions with the land bank. They didn’t answer the questions on why they’re removing me from this committee.”
RELATED STORY: Residents protest after Council rejects rent stabilization in narrow vote
Owens has been among the land bank’s most vocal critics. He cited a 2024 performance audit from the city auditor that found failures across nearly every financial category, including delayed reports, unqualified staffing, and unvalidated reserves. The audit also noted the organization’s failure to complete timely financial documentation, including some records that were over a year late.
“They have misused funds,” Owens said. “And we have an official report from our city auditor that states that.”
Cabrera defends votes, sparking friction 
Owens directly questioned Councilmember Maria Cabrera — who sits on the land bank board — about her continued support for the agency despite the audit findings. Cabrera confirmed she voted to approve city funding for the land bank, even after the concerns were raised.
“You voted to give them money knowing there were financial issues raised by our own city auditor, correct?” Owens asked.
“Yes, I did,” Cabrera responded, adding that the city had committed $1.5 million to the land bank when it was created, but only delivered the full amount last year.

Cabrera defended the agency’s work in redeveloping vacant homes and stabilizing neighborhoods, especially on the city’s West Side and in Hilltop.
 “There are homeowners who bought them at an affordable price and are living there — single moms, grandmoms with their children,” she said.
But the exchange intensified an already strained debate, as Darby, Owens, and Hackett pushed back on what they described as a broken system that benefits well-connected nonprofits while sidelining ordinary residents.
Accusations of favoritism and gentrification 
Critics said the land bank has reserved properties for organizations whose leaders serve on the board, such as Habitat for Humanity, while declining to disclose who sits on its advisory board or why certain lots are designated “reserved.”
Owens, who represents Wilmington’s East Side, said homes transferred through the land bank in his district were selling for over $300,000 — far out of reach for most residents, whose average income is about $36,000.
RELATED STORY: Carney signs FY 2026 Budget, citing shared vision for neighborhood investment and public safety
“They’re not trying to get affordable housing for residents here in the city of Wilmington,” Owens said. “They’re trying to market this in the Philadelphia market to attract professionals.”
Several residents raised similar concerns during public comment, sharing experiences of being denied access to desirable homes or steered toward neglected properties in under-resourced neighborhoods. One mother described how her daughter tried for years to purchase land bank homes on Ninth Street, only to be directed elsewhere.
“They’re divvying out houses where they want you to live,” she said. “You’re not going to get those houses in areas where gentrification is happening.”
Land Bank accused of dodging Gibraltar oversight
Resident Maggie Messinger criticized the land bank’s handling of a Council resolution requiring a public hearing on the transfer of the historic Gibraltar mansion. Instead of a formal forum, she said, the land bank staged a neighborhood association presentation with glossy photos and no financial data, failing to address how over $3 million in taxpayer funds had been spent or how the mansion fit into the agency’s mission.
“The land bank is paying the bills, but no one knows what the plan is,” Messinger said. “Not one page in that shiny magazine had one piece of information about money.”
Council divided on a path forward
The ordinance calls for transferring land bank properties back to the city’s Department of Real Estate and Housing. Darby and Owens argue the move is necessary to rebuild a more transparent and equitable approach to housing development.
“They don’t deserve grace,” Owens said. “They haven’t done what they should be doing for our community.”
Councilmember Nathan Field and Councilmember Yolanda McCoy acknowledged oversight failures but said the city should focus on fixing the land bank rather than eliminating it.
“Fix it rather than end it,” Field said. McCoy added, “We dropped the ball-but we’re in a different term now. Let’s fix it.”
Council President Trippi Congo denied having supported Owens’ removal, but Owens insisted that internal Council emails confirmed efforts to sideline him and Hackett.

WILMINGTON — A planned replacement of gas flares at the Wilmington Wastewater Treatment Plant would increase air emissions due to a proposed switch to propane-fired pilot flames.
The plant, located at 12th Street and Hay Road, uses flares to burn off digester gas, a byproduct of sewage treatment. The proposed upgrade includes two elevated flares that will feature continuous pilot flames for safety. These pilots are small flames that stay lit to ensure the main flare can ignite as needed.
Originally, the city proposed that the pilot flames would be powered by digester gas, but it has since opted to use propane instead. According to DNREC, this change slightly increases emissions from the flare system.
“Basically, the city’s WWT facility has proposed replacing their existing flares with new flares to be fired by propane gas,” DNREC spokesperson Michael Globetti explained in an email to Delaware LIVE. 
According to Globetti, the city had originally planned for the flare pilots to run on digester gas, but later revised the application to use propane instead. The switch alters how the system operates and affects the air quality profile of the project. He explained, “This changed the emissions associated with the flare pilot, which would result in slightly increased emissions.”
If approved, the new flare system would be permitted to emit annually:


2.02 tons of particulate matter (PM, PM10, PM2.5)


4.60 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx)


1.37 tons of sulfur dioxide (SO₂)


6.92 tons of carbon monoxide (CO)


0.49 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)


The flare replacement would also involve the installation of a 1,200-gallon propane tank. Internal correspondence between Jacobs and DNREC indicates that the emissions increase from the propane pilot is minimal and does not exceed regulatory limits.
Residents can inspect the applications or submit public comments or hearing requests until July 7, 2025. Requests for a hearing must include a familiarity with the application and a reasoned statement of its potential impact.
DNREC stated it will not provide additional comments. If a public hearing is requested and the DNREC Secretary decides it is warranted, the department would also withhold further comment until the public record is closed and a final permitting decision is made.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wastewater-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

(Stock photo by Tolgart/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina enters the 2026 campaign season without any state laws preventing political candidates from using artificial intelligence to make unfounded attacks against their opponents.
Twenty-five states now require disclosures when using AI in campaign materials or banned its use altogether, with a number of them passing their laws ahead of the 2024 election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In the last presidential election cycle, GOP hopeful Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign shared AI-generated images of President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one-time chief medical adviser to the president, who is loathed by much of Trump’s base. And in New Hampshire, robocalls impersonating former President Joe Biden discouraged voters from casting their ballots in the state’s pre-South Carolina presidential primary.
The man responsible for spreading the calls was acquitted of charges related to voter suppression that could have sent him to prison for decades, according to The Associated Press.
South Carolina’s already-contentious gubernatorial race officially launched Monday, as the first two Republicans announced their bids.
Other Republicans expected to enter the fray include U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, which could create two wide-open races for Congress too. Other statewide races on the ballot in 2026 include U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s contested re-election bid.
Yet, in a state with a decades-old reputation for mud-slinging campaigns, there are no legal restrictions on using AI to take the political hijinks to a whole new level.
“We have seen a lot of meddling in our elections to help influence people,” said state Rep. Jermaine Johnson.
The Columbia Democrat has introduced legislation the last two years that would ban using AI in the three months before Election Day, unless the campaign material discloses that the image, video, or audio “has been manipulated or generated by artificial intelligence.”
AI will play a role in election misinformation. Experts are trying to fight back

Without that disclosure, if the campaign ads look or sound like the other person and intend to damage their reputation, the targeted candidate could seek damages in court. Violators could also be sentenced to up to 90 days in jail and fined $500, according to the latest proposal Johnson pre-filed last December for this year’s session.
As it stands, both the state Election Commission and Ethics Commission told the SC Daily Gazette there is little to limit the use of AI in campaign material.
AI in an SC election
In last year’s election for chief prosecutor of the 9th Circuit, made up of Berkeley and Charleston counties, incumbent Solicitor Scarlett Wilson used AI to mimic the voice of her opponent, former employee David Osborne, in a campaign ad.
A 30-second ad on local television and posted to Facebook last October included an AI-generated voice that was supposed to sound like Osborne reading emails he sent to Wilson, The Post and Courier reported.
“I think what made me comfortable is it was verbatim. It was his words” Wilson told the Gazette.
But Palmetto State Democrats were outraged.
Christale Spain, chair of the state Democratic Party, called for the State Law Enforcement Division to investigate, saying the emails were official communication between two employees. She contended that Wilson needed to file a public records request to be able to use the emails for political purposes.
Lachlan McIntosh, Osborne’s campaign consultant, called the ad, which used pieces of emails sent six months apart, “exceedingly unfair.” If the prosecutor had done that in court, he added, “the case would have been thrown out.”
SLED did not respond when asked if it investigated the video. Regardless, Wilson defeated Osborne by 22 points to keep the job she’s held since 2008.
Wilson said the outcry by Democrats brought more attention to the ad, working in her favor because it used his words.
Now in her fifth term, Wilson told the SC Daily Gazette as long as the claims being made are accurate, she has no issue with AI in campaigns.
However, she said, some guardrails are needed.
“It could be very dangerous,” she said. “I think I’d be fine with limits on it. As long as words and visuals are accurate … I think that should be fair game.”
When Johnson saw the advertisement, he said he went to colleagues and said, “I told you so.”

Neither of his bills has received any traction.
The latest was sent to the Judiciary Committee on the first day of session in January but has yet to receive a hearing. Since 2025 was the first of a two-year session, the proposal could still be heard next year without being re-filed.
When asked about the bill, House Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton said his committee received 469 bills last year and just didn’t have the time to properly vet them all.
“We’re in a new era. We’re in a new frontier regarding AI,” said the Bluffton Republican.
He pointed to bills criminalizing the use of AI to create child pornography — whether using actual or computer-generated photos of children. Another law passed this year criminalizes the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, to include fake images made through AI.
“The laws on the book years ago didn’t contemplate anything about AI,” Newton said. “So, there’s a whole host of issues we’re now beginning to talk about.”
Rep. Jeff Bradley, the head of the House regulatory and technology advisory committee, thinks Johnson’s proposal will likely get heard next year.
A federal ban?
But there’s a chance come January that the Legislature will no longer be able to consider Johnson’s bill, or any legislation with AI for that matter.
Included in the 1,000-plus page “Big Beautiful Bill” pushed by President Donald Trump that narrowly passed the House is a 10-year ban on passing regulations surrounding AI.
“No state or political subdivision thereof may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, any law or regulation of that State or a political subdivision thereof limiting, restricting or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce,” the bill reads.
The proposal has exceptions for bills that remove legal impediments to AI, streamline its use or do not impose “substantiative design, performance, data-handling, documentation, civil liability, taxation” or fees on the rapidly evolving technology.
Attorneys general, including South Carolina’s Alan Wilson, and state legislators across the country have spoken out against the moratorium that has caused GOP in-fighting on Capitol Hill, according to reports.
South Carolina Rep. Brandon Guffey was the top signature on a letter signed by more than 260-state lawmakers urging Congress to remove the ban from the 1,000-plus page proposal.
The Rock Hill Republican testified in front of the U.S. Senate in February on a bill that required social media platforms to take down manipulated images and was recognized by Trump when he signed it into law.
Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, penned an op-ed with California state legislator Jacqui Irwin in Governing, an outlet geared towards government officials, also cautioning the potential impact of stripping power from legislators to regulate AI.
Alexander and Irwin are the leaders of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Privacy.
“The states are leading the way because our constituents have asked us to guard against the worst abuses and threats of AI,” the piece said. “Each of these laws — and hundreds more like them — were passed by legislatures on a broadly bipartisan basis. Yet each is now under threat of invalidation by a little-noticed provision in the reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House.”
The mega-bill is under debate in the Senate, so the moratorium could be amended — or removed entirely. But if passed, it could eliminate the chance of regulating AI when it comes to South Carolina’s elections until 2035.
Lynn Teague with the League of Women Voters’ state chapter, said the AI ban frightens her because the technology is rapidly growing. And when it comes to voters, it’s only going to get easier to misinform them.
“The potential for misrepresentation, outright deception, with AI is so high,” Teague said. “We all know by the time something is out there in the public, correcting it becomes very hard.”
“An original lie spreads faster than the truth,” she added.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-computer-screen-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 10:02:53.367367

That’s in part because of a decision by Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to reject the Missouri Gaming Commission’s emergency rules, which would have fast-tracked the rulemaking process.
Jan Zimmerman, chair of the Missouri Gaming Commission, said the emergency rule would have given highway patrol staff more time to complete the “extensive” process of investigating license applicants.
But Hoskins wrote in a statement that the regular process — including a public comment period and a review by a state committee — was needed to ensure “the people of Missouri are appropriately informed and have a say in the final decisions.”
In a constitutional amendment that voters narrowly approved last year to legalize sports betting in Missouri, the state was given a deadline of Dec. 1, 2025, to launch sports betting. The state is on track to meet that deadline, Zimmerman said.
The commission in May approved Missouri’s new sports betting rules, which “cover everything from processing license applications to disciplinary action,” Zimmerman said.
“Every phase of sports wagering allows us to provide oversight,” she added.
License applications are currently open. Zimmerman said “untethered” licenses, which go to operators not connected to a casino or stadium, will be issued in August while other licenses will be issued in November.
While “everyone is anxious for the end of baseball season (and) the beginning of football season,” Zimmerman said, “it’s important that the gaming commission staff get it right … Our responsibility is to protect the industry and the folks who work in the industry, but also to protect the citizens of Missouri.”
The state expects to collect about $28 million in tax revenue from sports betting annually. However, how much money will go to schools — a key selling point used during last year’s campaign — is still unclear.
Some of the taxes collected will first be used to cover the commission’s regulatory expenses, according to the amendment. After that, $5 million or 10% — whichever is more — will be sent to the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund. The rest will be used for K-12 and higher education.
 A new fund for problem gambling

The amendment created the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund, which is distinct from the Missouri Department of Mental Health’s Compulsive Gamblers Fund.
Overseen by the state treasurer and managed by the Gaming Commission, the new fund will help provide compulsive gambling counseling and support services, develop problem-gambling treatment and prevention programs and distribute grants to organizations that help people with compulsive gambling problems.
Unlike other state appropriations — which, if unspent, typically go back to the general revenue fund — this fund will roll over into following years.
That’s a critical part of addressing compulsive gambling in the state, according to Keith Spare, chair of the Kansas City Port Authority Problem Gambling Advisory Committee and the Missouri Alliance to Curb Problem Gambling.
“In the case of this $5 million, if it is not spent, it stays in the fund to be spent later. That’s incredible, because that means you have something to plan on,” he said. “Missouri funding will now be, for the first time in history, secure for problem gambling.”
Roughly 3.1 million Missourians participate in some form of gambling each year, according to a 2022 study. About 200,000 met the criteria for a gambling disorder and another million met enough criteria to be considered at-risk.
An estimated 1.2% of adults globally have a gambling disorder. In the United States, the legalization of gambling and the proliferation of sports betting have made compulsive gambling — which experts consider an addiction similar to alcohol and drugs — more widespread, especially among young men.
New data suggests that when a state legalizes gambling, the number of bankruptcies rises between 20% and 35%. Financial hardship is one of the main reasons that nationally, an estimated one in five compulsive gamblers considers or attempts suicide, said Spare, a retired substance use and compulsive gambling counselor.
With sports betting going live in Missouri this year, Spare and other experts are worried that outcomes like bankruptcy and suicide will become more severe even if the number of people with gambling disorders doesn’t rise much.
“When you have the prevalence of gambling online — and this is going to be largely online — you have the ability to gamble day and night, basically in a private setting,” he added. “That’s putting gas on a fire.”
 A fresh start?

The money allocated to the Compulsive Gaming Prevention Fund will help the state better serve people with compulsive gambling problems. But Spare’s main concern is whether the department — which he said “has largely abandoned problem gamblers” — will spend the money effectively.
“I’ve said to (the department) from the beginning: ‘You need an advisory committee. You need people who can tell you what’s a good idea, what’s not a good idea, and here’s how to do it,’” he said.  “But like they’ve done all along, they want to do what they want to do and not have any public input.”
The Missouri Department of Mental Health repeatedly declined requests for an interview and only replied to one of several questions sent by The Beacon.
In that response, a spokesperson wrote that the new fund is managed by the Gaming Commission, but that in the recently approved state budget, the General Assembly approved $4 million from the fund to go to the Department of Mental Health.
That money includes $1.5 million for “prevention and education services,” $500 thousand for “adult psychiatric services” and $2 million for “treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.”
Spare said that although the Department of Mental Health requested some money from the older fund — the Compulsive Gamblers Fund — for several years, “last year, they drew down nothing.”
He said that when he asked the department’s director of behavioral health, Nora Bock, about her division’s limited use of the fund, he was told, “‘Well, my counselors don’t know that there’s many gamblers out there.’”
“Well, that’s all in how you ask the question,” Spare told The Beacon. “If you say, ‘Do you have a gambling problem?’ every gambler is going to say no … Her opinion is that if there isn’t a lot of demand (for counseling), there isn’t a lot of problem gambling. Well, that doesn’t mean people aren’t dying.”
The department did not respond to The Beacon’s questions about Spare’s concerns.
Spare said a major reason for low demand for help is a lack of awareness that is due, in part, to the fact that counseling and other services are only advertised on casino, lottery and sports betting ads.
“There’s a difference between marketing to get gamblers in treatment … (and) traditional advertising for casinos and the lottery,” he said. “You need to find a way to get advertising to the general public and to the gamblers about when this is a problem, why it’s a problem and what to do about it.”
He said the state has spent decades “getting alcohol and drug abuse to be recognizable” so that people can identify the warning signs of addiction in their loved ones and help them find care, but “there’s nothing like that for problem gambling.”
“We need advertising that says not to gamble, to be aware that if you do gamble, these are the problem signs, and if you see them in your family member or neighbor or co-worker, raise the alarm,” Spare said.
 Accessing care

Even for those who do seek help, state resources are limited, Spare said.
Nine agencies have contracts with the Department of Mental Health to provide compulsive gambling counseling services at no cost to qualifying Missourians. However, of those, only six have a certified gambling disorder counselor on staff.
Calls to the 1-888-BETSOFF number are routed to these counselors. In the Kansas City region, the state has partnered with University Health in Kansas City and Family Guidance Center in St. Joseph.
Jordyn Johnston, an alcohol and drug counselor at University Health, is also a gambling disorder counselor, providing in-person and remote counseling for people living anywhere in Missouri.
She currently works with eight compulsive gambling patients and said she has seen demand increase over time, particularly in rural areas.
Part of that increase could stem from the legalization of sports betting in Kansas in 2022, with many Missourians crossing the border to place wagers.
“I live on the Kansas side, and I actually see people pulled off on the 435 ramp on Saturday mornings, placing their bets,” Johnston said. “There’ll be like five to 10 cars lined up on those off-ramps.”
As demand for services increases, it places more strain on the state’s gambling disorder counselors, many of whom are also alcohol and substance use counselors. While Johnston works with eight patients with a gambling disorder, she works with 35 to 40 patients with substance use disorder.
She said that as the state prepares for another potential increase in the number of people seeking care for gambling disorders, she’s hopeful that University Health and other organizations will bring on more counselors.
Spare said Oklahoma offers a virtual training for problem gambling counseling that, for a $4,000 annual fee, an unlimited number of Missouri-based counselors can attend. But he said the Department of Mental Health hasn’t expressed much interest in the Oklahoma program.
While the state hotline refers people to the handful of agencies that have partnered with the state, there are other counselors across Missouri, Spare said. Port KC’s Problem Gambling Advisory Committee paid for dozens to be trained in the last few years alone.
The problem, he said, is that there isn’t a comprehensive list of public and private counselors able to provide problem gambling care, which makes it harder to find a local counselor or gauge how well the current supply of counselors could keep up with a potential increase in demand.
Johnston said that if people with gambling disorders aren’t able to access care, the repercussions could be dire for them and their families.
“The rate of suicide is increasingly high for those people, because gambling is an addiction where it doesn’t really have those outward symptoms. … A lot of the things that they go through are really hidden, and even their family doesn’t know,” she said.
“A lot of it is financial problems — they’re in so much debt, they’ve gambled away their house, and they really feel like there’s no other option left, (like) there’s nothing else for them and suicide is the only option,” she added.
 Building a better sports betting system

Spare said Missouri could learn from neighbors like Kansas and Oklahoma, which pay for specialists and counselors statewide and offer a hotline staffed by trained gambling counselors.
“In Missouri, we have a hotline paid for by the gaming industry that’s answered by college students … All they try to do is make referrals,” he said.
Asked what the state should do with its new fund, Spare advocated for a full range of services, including individual and family counseling, inpatient treatment and “first and foremost, an advertising campaign … that gets people to come for treatment.”
He also pushed for a “no wrong door” approach through which mental health and substance use counselors are also trained to provide gambling disorder care so that “wherever someone shows up looking for care, it’s available.”
That care must also be long-term, Spare said, likening it to addressing substance use disorder.
“Addiction is a mental disease. It’d be like saying, ‘We’re going to give you six weeks of medicine for schizophrenia and then we’re not going to worry about you,’ he said. “It’s crazy, but some people think that way: ‘Why aren’t you over it? Why don’t you quit? Why did you start again?’ Because it’s an addiction.”

(USDA NRCS photo)The nutrition and agriculture sections of the reconciliation bill under consideration by the U.S. Senate threaten to do more harm than good for Alaska’s food systems. While some provisions may offer benefits for agriculture nationwide, the bill — when applied to Alaska’s unique landscape — projects a net loss for our state.
At a time when prices and uncertainty are at all-time highs, and we have one of the highest percentages of farmers who’ve farmed less than 10 years in the nation, Alaska’s food producers and vulnerable families need meaningful support. This bill instead shifts resources away from small farms, undermines nutrition programs and imposes new costs on a state still recovering from the pandemic. It also risks delaying or derailing the farm bill reauthorization — essential to Alaska’s food security.
Nutrition cuts will deepen hunger in Alaska
Proposed changes to nutrition programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will have devastating consequences for food security in Alaska. The bill mandates a “cost-neutral” approach to the Thrifty Food Plan — limiting SNAP benefit levels to inflation. This ignores the state’s exceptionally high food costs. 
In 2023, Alaska’s food retailers—including grocery stores and farmers markets—brought in $281 million in SNAP dollars, directly supporting local economies and families. Undermining this support puts both at risk.
Work requirements are another red flag. Lowering the age exemption for dependent children to 10 years old is not just tone-deaf — it’s dangerous. With limited child care options across the state, these rules force impossible choices, especially for single parents.
Additionally, requiring a 10% unemployment rate to waive work mandates ignores rural job scarcity; only a few regions in Alaska meet that threshold, yet many face equally dire employment prospects. The bill also removes bipartisan exemptions for veterans, homeless individuals, and former foster youth — groups for whom SNAP is a lifeline.
The bill penalizes SNAP recipients for receiving energy or internet assistance. In rural Alaska, where basic utilities are costly and connectivity is essential, this change effectively asks families to choose between food, heat and access to opportunity.
A proposed 15% cost shift to states for SNAP benefits would saddle Alaska with an estimated $37 million in additional costs — on top of new administrative burdens. These costs will worsen cost-shifting to municipalities, and reduce services for families.
Eliminating the SNAP-Ed program further undermines health equity. In 2024 alone, Alaska’s SNAP-Ed program reached nearly 14,000 residents with proven success in promoting healthier diets. Cutting it directly contradicts the administration’s health goals.
Hunger doesn’t go away because we turn our backs. 
Agricultural provisions leave Alaska behind
Despite headlines touting support for agriculture, the bill’s farm programs prioritize large-scale commodity producers. Alaska’s small and independent farmers are left with crumbs. Expanded subsidies for commodity crops like corn and soy offer little to a state where fewer than 3% of farms qualify, and where not a single Agriculture Risk Coverage or Price Loss Coverage payment was issued in 2023. These programs provide funding to farmers whose income falls below certain levels, but only for a limited set of commodities. 
Crop insurance, too, largely bypasses Alaska, serving fewer than 10 producers annually. While we appreciate provisions to expand beginning farmer support and Whole Farm Revenue Protection — an insurance program that helps farms manage risk — they don’t offset the broader imbalance.
The bill cancels funds from conservation programs through the Natural Resource Conservation Service, which have been critical in Alaska for high tunnels, soil management, crop studies, and so much more. Proposed investments in agricultural research are welcome, but match requirements and competitive processes disadvantage Alaska’s relatively small institutions like the University of Alaska Fairbanks Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. Without reforms, these funds will continue to bypass our research institutions.
We need policy that reflects Alaska’s reality
From Nome to the Mat-Su to Ketchikan, Alaskans are building vibrant, resilient food systems — but we need federal partners and policy that reflects our state’s realities. Alaska’s producers operate on small plots of land, in extreme climates, with vulnerable supply chains and limited infrastructure. Our food assistance programs are lifelines, not luxuries. Food pantries and food banks across Alaska are already stretched beyond their limits. 
We believe Congress should listen to the lived experience of Alaskans and amend this reconciliation bill to protect nutrition programs, preserve state flexibility, invest equitably in small farms, and defend the critical groundwork laid by the farm bill. The wide scope of potential impacts across Alaska’s food systems makes clear the reconciliation bill must reflect the realities on the ground here. If not, our communities, food producers, businesses, and families will bear the consequences.

Chari,,,,,https://minnesotareformer.com/2025/06/24/minnesotans-are-still-dying-more-than-they-were-before-covid-why/,"Deaths in Minnesota declined for the second year in a row in 2023, but mortality’s still higher than it was in 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2023, the most recent year with data available, Minnesota’s age-adjusted death rate was 681.7 per 100,000, compared to 649.2 in 2019 and 756.5 at the pandemic’s peak in 2021.

This mirrors nationwide trends, though Minnesota’s death rate is lower than the national one. Relative to the United States as a whole, Minnesota has a low poverty rate and strong access to health care. In 2023, 3.8% of Minnesotans were uninsured, compared to 7.6% of Americans.
Still, the data underscore Minnesota’s vast and longstanding disparities in health and other outcomes of well-being. The mortality rate among Black and Indigenous Minnesotans was higher to begin with and rose more sharply during the pandemic. Across the country, Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to experience unemployment and to live in poverty, both of which are correlated with an increased risk of death. These economic gaps are especially stark in Minnesota, which is by many measures one of the nation’s least racially equitable states. 
The pandemic served to reinforce the disparities. People of color were more likely to work jobs that involve a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and less likely to have adequate access to medical care. The latter was especially true of Indigenous Americans who live on reservations. Researchers at the University of Minnesota studied neighborhood-level death rates before and during the outbreak of COVID-19. They found that in general, death rates were higher in poorer neighborhoods. Members of racial minorities are much more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Before the pandemic, though, people of color living in disadvantaged neighborhoods were actually less likely to die than white residents of the same neighborhoods. But the COVID-19 death rate was higher for people of color even when controlling for geography. 

For all racial groups, however, the overall death rate fell in 2022 and 2023 — but remained elevated. COVID is one driver. While the COVID-19 death rate in Minnesota has plummeted since the height of the pandemic — from 71.9 per 100,000 people in 2021 to 12 in 2023 — it’s still obviously higher than in 2019. And not all of the increase in mortality during the pandemic was from the disease itself. In 2022, researchers at the Mayo Clinic released a paper studying changes in Minnesota mortality in 2020. They found that gun homicides, accidental poisoning, malnutrition, alcoholic liver disease and other types of liver disease also increased.
As the pandemic waned, not all of these causes of death declined as dramatically as COVID. In fact, as of 2023, deaths from starvation and non-alcoholic chronic liver disease were trending upward. 

Rates of food insecurity started rising in 2020 and haven’t stopped, with the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families reporting that food shelf visits increased for the fourth straight year in 2024, bringing them to 2.5 times the pre-pandemic number. Households of color and those with school-aged children are more likely to experience food insecurity. The Mayo Clinic study, however, found that those most vulnerable to malnutrition deaths were women 85 years and older, white women, and rural residents. Older people who needed help eating were particularly at risk during the pandemic. The Star Tribune reported on multiple cases of nursing home residents who stopped eating during COVID isolation and starved to death.  
Firearm homicides, on the other hand, were more common in inner cities. Nationally, the murder rate has fallen each year since 2020, reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2024. But Minneapolis hasn’t yet seen a similar decline. The murder rate in the city has remained high since the pandemic and rose slightly in 2024, though early numbers show that it is trending down this year. 
There’s some evidence that more Americans began drinking heavily during the pandemic, resulting in more alcohol-related deaths. But nationally and in the state, binge drinking and alcohol-related deaths have been trending upward since well before 2020. 
Minnesota’s binge drinking rate is one of the nation’s highest.

Many age groups have seen elevated death rates in the wake of the pandemic, even those less likely to die of COVID. Infant mortality rates, for example, increased during the pandemic and remain slightly higher than they were, though infants are very unlikely to die of COVID. Reduced access to medical care may be responsible, as maternal mortality rates also increased. But the increase in mortality is most pronounced among older Americans, who made up 90% of COVID-19 deaths in 2023.
Overall, the data shows that bringing the death rate down to pre-pandemic levels will take more than controlling one disease. It will require attacking the root causes of excess deaths, such as food insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate health care access, with special attention paid to vulnerable populations such as seniors and those giving birth.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1217649916.jpg,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

The McMullan Young Writers Workshop at Millsaps College in Jackson gives aspiring authors a chance to sharpen and share their work. 
Fifty high school and 12 middle school students participated in themed workshops taught by published authors. The students submitted short stories, poems and novel excerpts to their instructors and peers for feedback.
Courtlandt Willingham, a Jackson native and rising junior at Mississippi School of the Arts in Brookhaven, described the workshop process as, “listen, ask questions and write.”
Willingham attended a workshop themed around folklore and mythmaking, and that provided inspiration for his poetry.
He said folklore means different things depending on the person.
“Folklore, to me, is a collection of ideas about being a Mississippian — especially a Black Mississippian,” Willingham said.

The residential workshop took place June 9-13. One day, campers attended a private craft talk and keynote speech by Jack Davis, who won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for history for his book, “The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea.”
Keynote speakers in previous years included acclaimed authors Kiese Laymon, Joyce Carol Oates and Angie Thomas.
“These young people will ask keynote authors questions that are not the standard, boring questions that adults ask,” said Jamie Dickson, a workshop instructor. He said the visiting writers are not condescending to young people.
“Someone who is truly invested in literature really understands that there’s a lot of truth to the cliche: ‘This is the next generation of writers,’” Dickson said.
Students attended lectures on screenwriting techniques, the Afrofuturism genre and the connection between artmaking and political life.
They spent an afternoon touring the Eudora Welty House and Garden.
“I’ve been in the garden before,” said Hannah King, a rising freshman at Belhaven University. “I went into the garden and wrote a poem about it. I hadn’t been able to finish it. But when I went back there, I was able to finish it — because I was touring the house.”
Instructors took students to other Jackson cultural sites, including the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, the Mississippi Museum of Art, Lemuria book store and the COFO Civil Rights Education Center at Jackson State University. 
Campers at Millsaps cheered and drumrolled as their instructors went up to the podium to read in front of a handwritten poster proclaiming “Open Mic Night.”
“I think Open Mic is everyone’s favorite night,” said Syd Clay, a rising sophomore at Northwest Rankin High School. 
“It’s just fun being able to have a community that you can share things with,” Clay said. “My class this year was mainly first-years, and they were all really nervous about the Open Mic. But, at the end of the night, they all loved it.”

Honey bees across the country are under attack from tiny, eight-legged parasitic mites. These mites burrow between the segments of the bees’ adult bodies or invade their larvae and infect them with viruses — deforming their wings and leaving them flightless.
That’s not only problematic for the bees — whose entire colonies can collapse from a mite invasion — but also for California, which relies on the bees for its food production and economy. 
Earlier this month the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct the California Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a health program for managed honey bees. The department would work with beekeepers, farmers, scientists and other stakeholders to provide grants for projects and research that support managed honey bees.
Honey bees are essential for pollinating almonds, which are a lucrative multibillion-dollar industry. The bees also produced 13.3 million pounds of honey in 2024, or nearly 10% of the country’s supply, valued at $32.8 million.
But beginning in the late 1980s, Varroa mites native to Asia began infiltrating bee colonies in the U.S. By the early 2000s, they were “in everyone’s hives,” said Ryan Burris, the president of the California State Beekeepers Association.
Pesticides and other pest management methods stabilized the bee population over the decades. But commercial honey bee deaths have been soaring in the U.S. in recent years, and the reason why remains unclear. Between June 2024 and March 2025, beekeepers lost 1.6 million colonies — an average of 62% of their colonies.
The proposed program would provide grants to help beekeepers and farmers plant more crops or purchase probiotics to improve the bees’ health, among other things.
The bill is currently before the Senate Agriculture Committee, where it could be considered as early as mid-July.

Newsom slows roll on return to office mandate


Vehicles on Route 580 toward Oakland on July 22, 2019. Photo by Anne Wernikoff, CalMatters




From CalMatters deputy editor Adam Ashton:
Gov. Gavin Newsom is open to giving California public employees a temporary break on his return-to-office mandate.
The union representing about 14,000 state engineers made a deal that delays the four-day-a-week order for one year. It was supposed to take effect July 1.
The Professional Engineers in California Government disclosed that agreement alongside a new contract that includes some concessions Newsom wanted to trim payroll expenses as he tries to shore up a $12 billion budget deficit.
Workers represented by the union will get a 3% raise next week, but it’d be offset by mandatory unpaid time off that would basically negate the pay increase for two years. That’s similar to the terms of a deal Newsom made last week with the union representing state prison guards.

Ted Toppin, PECG’s executive director: “These two agreements are the best terms possible for our members at this time. … The PECG Team worked hard to deliver on the items that are most important to PECG members and make improvements in their pay and benefits, despite challenging times.”

Newsom embraced telework policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. He brought public employees back to the office twice-a-week last year, and ordered a bigger move to four-days-a-week in May.

Congress follows up on CalMatters investigation


A Covered California enrollment center in Chula Vista on April 29, 2024. Photo by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters




After CalMatters and The Markup published an investigation in April that found that Covered California shared enrollees’ personal data with LinkedIn, Congress is demanding answers.
As Colin Lecher and Tomas Apodaca explain, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives sent a letter last week to the executive director of the state’s health insurance marketplace expressing their concern about the “the privacy and security implications” revealed by the investigation.
When visitors filled out forms on Covered California’s website, trackers sent information to LinkedIn, including information about whether visitors were blind, pregnant, used a high number of prescription drugs or reported that they were transgender or possible victims of domestic abuse. The data tracking operated for more than a year.
Since the publication of the story, most ad trackers have been removed from the site, and Covered California said it paused its use of trackers entirely. Four other state-run health care sites were also found to be sharing information with tech companies.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: California’s struggling farming industry has reached a tipping point — but lawmakers seem more willing to assist the state’s film industry instead. 
There are a number of interim solutions between living on the street and finding permanent housing, and bills bolstering this framework would help California reach functional zero for unsheltered homelessness, writes state Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat representing California’s 38th Senate District.

Honey bees, a critical component of California’s agriculture, face several challenges to survival. Will the Legislature spend more money in a deficit year to try and address the problems facing the bees?


Honey bees across the country are under attack from tiny, eight-legged parasitic mites. These mites burrow between the segments of the bees’ adult bodies or invade their larvae and infect them with viruses — deforming their wings and leaving them flightless.
That’s not only problematic for the bees — whose entire colonies can be destroyed by an unchecked mite invasion — but also for California, which relies on the bees for its food production and economy. 
Earlier this month the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct the California Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a health program for managed honey bees. The department would work with beekeepers, farmers, scientists, agricultural commissioners and other stakeholders to provide grants for projects and research that support managed honey bees.
“Without our honey bees, we are at risk of losing jobs and a huge part of our economy,” said Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Stockton Democrat and co-author of the bill author. “This (bill) is integral at maintaining our ability to be self-sustaining and contributing to healthy foods in the U.S. and across the world.” 
Another Central Valley lawmaker, Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick of Redding, co-authored the bill.
Honey bees and mites
Compared to carpenter bees or bumble bees, honey bees are much more manageable pollinators that build stronger and bigger colonies. They’re essential for pollinating California’s most lucrative crops, including cherries, melons and almonds. California almonds are a multibillion-dollar industry, and the pollination of California almond orchards serves as the largest honey bee migration in the world. 
In 2024, California bees also produced 13.3 million pounds of honey — nearly 10% of the country’s supply — valued at $32.8 million.
But beginning in the late 1980s, Varroa mites originally native to Asia began infiltrating bee colonies in the U.S. By the early 2000s, they were “in everyone’s hives,” said Ryan Burris, the president of the California State Beekeepers Association and a third generation beekeeper.

Pesticides and other pest management methods stabilized the bee population over the decades somewhat. But commercial honey bee deaths have been soaring in the U.S. in recent years, and the reason why remains unclear. Between June 2024 and March 2025, beekeepers lost 1.6 million colonies — an average of 62% of their colonies. This nationwide scarcity has also given rise to more beehive thefts. 
Besides the mites, honey bees are threatened by pesticides, habitat loss and a lack of food and nutrition. Each hazard presents its own problems, but the mites in particular have vexed beekeepers. 
Killing the mites with pesticides is complex: The mites have grown resistant to some chemicals, so beekeepers have to routinely swap out different pesticides while trying to avoid contaminating the bees’ honey with large doses of chemicals. The financial losses due to mites can be staggering, according to Burris.
“There’s a time when you’re treating, treating, treating. You want to give the bees a break but the mites just come back,” Burris said. “They blow up, and all the money you spent trying to save and treat the bees is out the door. It’s totally disheartening because this is our livelihood. A hive can get you almond pollination money; pollination money off of other crops; and honey.”
A health program for bees
The Managed Honeybee Health Program proposed by Ransom and Hadwick would provide grants to help beekeepers and farmers plant more crops for bees to forage on; buy feed; or purchase probiotics to improve the bees’ health, among other things
The program would be funded either through the state, nonstate, federal and private funds or a combination. Funding for the grants would likely range in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to the low millions, while operating costs, such as staff to manage contracts, would cost in the low hundreds of thousands, according to Carson Knight, a legislative aide for Ransom’s office.
While there is no formal opposition to the proposal, securing the funding could be a tough sell for lawmakers as they grapple with a $12 billion budget shortfall.
The bill is currently before the Senate Agriculture Committee, where it could be considered as early as mid-July. Until then, Burris said he is crossing his fingers that the measure, if signed into law, will help the beekeeping industry.
“Bees are so important,” Burris said. Without the bees, “you can take out three-quarters of your supermarket.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061025-Honey-Bee-Mites-REAUTERS-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

 Catherine Blakespear
State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat, represents California’s 38th Senate District.


Californians are tired and angry about the seemingly intractable, unsheltered, street homelessness crisis. 
After serving in elected office for 12 years, I have been frustrated by the many boxes that we’ve put around ourselves as policymakers that somehow justify allowing people to suffer, degrade and ultimately die in front of us, while our public spaces become living spaces for other humans. 
It’s a terrible reality for everyone. In the last decade more than 50,000 people died nationwide after living on the streets. This is unacceptable! 
Now, for the first time in years, there is growing recognition that we can end unsheltered homelessness, if we expand our concept of acceptable housing to be broader than someone’s forever home. There are a number of interim solutions between living unsheltered on the street and permanent housing. 
One proven scalable solution for building interim supportive housing is using temporarily vacant land and modular, relocatable cabins. These are not the “shelters” of the past. These are quick-build, clean, safe, modest housing units that provide shelter from the elements and have social workers on site. 
Wide-scale adoption of this interim housing would mean our streets aren’t a waiting room anymore for the 187,000 unsheltered homeless people in California. Interim housing can be constructed for as little as $50,000 a unit, compared to an average cost of $650,000 for a permanent housing unit. 
Some cities are leading the way. San Jose is on track to open 1,400 beds within 18 months — including more than 800 modular interim housing units — in stark contrast to taking the four to seven years, which is standard for traditional affordable housing projects. 
One of the pernicious problems in tackling homelessness in the real world is the “where” question. NIMBY-ism, bureaucratic hurdles, lawsuits and political jousting can lead to the inaccurate perception that nowhere in an entire city is the right place to build a small, homeless-serving housing project. This is absurd. 
We need to be more open-minded in considering locations. Urban landowners own undeveloped or under-developed parcels slated for future investments that could host shorter-term interim projects. 
Large parking lots that can be repurposed for a quick-build project are everywhere when you start to look — from aging shopping malls, to city civic centers, to community college campuses, to fairgrounds, to Caltrans park & ride lots. 
Old hotels and motels already provide separated rooms. 
And we need everyone to get on board — leaders in politics, business, labor, environment and community preservation. We should demand a goal of getting to functional zero in unsheltered street homelessness and that we have a plan to get there. 
Two bills this year — one by me (SB 16) and one from state Senator Josh Becker (SB 606) — would bolster this framework. The state and its regions would be required to develop a plan to reach and maintain functional zero for unsheltered homelessness, and they would be held accountable to use the tools the state has provided, including the Shelter Crisis Act passed in 2020 and the Low-Barrier Navigation Center law passed in 2019.
 We could make this happen by legislating property tax breaks, city incentives like the Regional Housing Needs Allocation credit, security and sanitation commitments from cities, flexible funding and automatic “by-right” approvals when projects satisfy zoning and local ordinances.
That could be paired with a requirement that all 500-plus cities and counties in the state participate in the provision of  in-patient treatment and interim housing.
Today, unfortunately, the preponderance of state funding comes with rigid restrictions that tie the money exclusively to permanent housing “exits.” For example, the state’s Homekey+ program specifies that “ineligible uses include: Interim Housing.”

The latest state Encampment Resolution Funds program now requires that any interim use must be accompanied by a concrete plan to move individuals into permanent housing. 
These restrictions prevent pragmatic interim solutions to bring people in off the streets fast and cost effectively. Cities should be empowered to use state funds for interim solutions.
Interim housing does not end all types of homelessness for all people at all stages. We still need to build enough permanent housing to end the housing crisis. 
But unsheltered homelessness is the most devastating. And it is actually solvable in the near term when we expand our definition of housing to include “housing now.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062325-San-Jose-Tiny-Homes-BANG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 09:06:35.408138

When Hank Woolley, a paleontological researcher who specializes in lizard evolution, opened a jar of bones labeled “lizard” at the Natural History Museum of Utah, he said his first thought was, “Oh wow, there’s a fragmentary skeleton here.” 
“We know very little about large-bodied lizards from the Kaiparowits Formation in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, so I knew this was significant right away,” said Woolley, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s Dinosaur Institute. 
With Woolley’s expertise, that jar of bones — even though it was collected back in 2005 — helped lead to a new discovery of a “racoon-sized armored monstersaurian,” a giant relative of the Gila monster, according to an announcement issued last week by the University of Utah. 
Inspired by a Middle Earth monster
Its name, Bolg amondol, was inspired by a “goblin prince” villain in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” universe. Bolg now represents an “evolutionary lineage that sprouted within a group of large-bodied lizards called monstersaurs that still roam the deserts from which Bolg was recovered,” according to the U. 
Woolley knew that a new species of monstersaur called for an appropriate name from an “iconic monster creator”: Tolkien, the university said in its release. 
“Bolg is a great sounding name. It’s a goblin prince from ‘The Hobbit,’ and I think of these lizards as goblin-like, especially looking at their skulls,” Woolley said.

He also used Tolkien’s fictional Elvish language Sindarin to craft the species’ epithet. “Amon” means “mound,” and “dol” means “head,” a reference to mound-like osteoderms (or bony deposits that act as a form of armor) found on Bolg’s and other monstersaurs’ skulls. 
“‘Mound-headed Bolg’ would fit right in with the goblins — and it’s revealing quite a bit about monstersaurs,” the U. said. 
‘Hidden treasures’ await in museum fossil collections
The research published June 17 in the journal Royal Society Open Science, led by the Dinosaur Institute in Los Angeles County and the Natural History Museum of Utah, “reveals hidden treasures awaiting future paleontologists in the bowels of museum fossil collections,” the university said, along with “the vast potential of paleontological heritage preserved in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and other public lands.” 
The field collection of the specimens were conducted under paleontological permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management, which also helped fund the study with a National Science Foundation award.

Though the Bolg specimen was first unearthed more than a decade ago, in 2005, Woolley’s expertise in lizard paleontology helped determine its significance. He was the lead author of the research. 
“Bolg is a great example of the importance of natural history museum collections,” said co-author Randy Irmis, an associate professor at the U. and curator of paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Utah, in the news release. “Although we knew the specimen was significant when it was discovered back in 2005, it took a specialist in lizard evolution like Hank to truly recognize its scientific importance and take on the task of researching and scientifically describing this new species.”
Though museum collection spaces are “sometimes stereotyped as dusty, forgotten places, the truth is quite the opposite,” the Natural History Museum of Utah said in a post about Bolg last week. The museum’s paleontology collection is a “glorified storage unit. Instead, it’s a space where staff, students, volunteers, and visiting researchers can care for fossils and conduct new research.”
“It was this reevaluation of collection specimens,” the museum added, “that led to Woolley’s breakthrough research on Bolg amondol.”

Bolg sheds light on lizard evolution mysteries
Irmis said discovering a new species of lizard that’s an ancestor of the modern-day Gila monster is “pretty cool in and of itself, but what’s particularly exciting is what it tells us about the unique 76-million-year-old ecosystem it lived in.” 
“The fact that Bolg co-existed with several other large lizard species indicates that this was a stable and productive ecosystem where these animals were taking advantage of a wide variety of prey and different micro-habitats,” Irmis said. 
Researchers identified the new species from a collection of skull, limbs, vertebrae and bony armor called osteoderms. Most fossil lizards from the dinosaur age “are even scrappier — often just single, isolated bones or teeth — so despite their fragmentary nature, the parts of Bolg’s skeleton that survived contain a stunning amount of information,” the U. said. 
“That means more characteristics are available for us to assess and compare to similar-looking lizards,” Woolley said. “Importantly, we can use those characteristics to understand this animal’s evolutionary relationships and test hypotheses about where it fits on the lizard tree of life.”
The clade (or ancestral grouping) of anguimorph lizards known as monstersauria are characterized by their large size and distinctive features, like “sharp, spire-like teeth and pitted, polygonal armor attached to their skulls.” 
Bolg, the U. said, “would have been a bit of a monster to our eyes.”

“Three feet tip to tail, maybe even bigger than that, depending on the length of the tail and torso,” Woolley said. “So, by modern lizard standards they’re a very large animal, similar in size to a Savannah monitor lizard; something that you wouldn’t want to mess around with.”
Monstersauria have a roughly 100-million-year history, but their fossil record is largely incomplete, meaning Bolg’s discovery is a “big deal” to help fully understand the prehistoric lizards and their world, the university said. 
“Bolg’s closest known relative hails from the other side of the planet in the Gobi Desert of Asia,” the U. said. “Though dinosaurs have long been known to have traveled between the once-connected continents of the Late Cretaceous Period, Bolg reveals that smaller animals also made the trek, suggesting there were common patterns of biogeography across terrestrial vertebrates during this time.”
Where was Bolg uncovered?
Bolg was discovered in the rocks of the Kaiparowits Formation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument — a formation that has emerged as a paleontological hotspot over the past 25 years, according to the U. 
Those rocks have produced “one of the most astounding dinosaur-dominated records in North America,” the university said. “Discoveries like this underscore the importance of preserving public lands in the Western U.S. for science and research.”
Co-author Joe Sertich, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Colorado State University, said in the release that the “exceptional record of big lizards” from Grand Staircase-Escalante “may prove to be a normal part of dinosaur-dominated ecosystems from North America.”
He said those lizards appear to have filled “key roles as smaller predators hunting down eggs and small animals in the forests of Laramidia,” which is an island continent that existed during the Late Cretaceous period.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
Changes to Senate Republicans’ budget proposal means even more Utah public land could be sold

Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”

Matthew Reeves, a partner with the firm, said in court last month he had used artificial intelligence to obtain citations in documents filed on behalf of the Alabama Department of Corrections in a lawsuit from an inmate alleging the department failed to protect him from violence.
Attorneys for the inmate first flagged the citations. U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, overseeing the case, described five of them as “hallucinations,” including at least two to cases that do not exist.
Representatives from Butler Snow told Manasco during the May hearing that the firm would review filings from other cases to investigate any other possible use of AI that led to fabricated citations in other documents.
Manasco agreed to the firm’s request at the hearing to allow Butler Snow to complete the internal investigation before she levies sanctions in the case.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, based in Philadelphia,  independently reviewed the filings. The firm also included declarations from the attorneys in the case that they have not used AI in this case or any other aside from Reeves.
“The firm has begun the process of implementing the revised policies and procedures previously described to the Court,” Butler Snow said in the filing. “In addition, Matthew B. Reeves is, in conjunction with Plaintiff’s counsel and law school professor Anil Mujumdar, engaging in efforts to educate law students regarding the risks and repercussions of the use of AI in legal practice to help deter such conduct by others.”
The case is a civil lawsuit filed by Frankie Johnson against the Alabama Department of Corrections after he was assaulted by 13 people and stabbed at least nine times at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer in December 2019.
Johnson alleges corrections staff failed to protect him which led to another assault in March 2020 when he was stabbed by another individual at Donaldson.
During the case, attorneys for the Alabama Department of Corrections filed a motion to depose Johnson the week of June 3, but his attorneys filed their own motion seeking to delay the deposition to better prepare their client for questioning.
Reeves then filed a response to that motion to challenge opposing counsel’s request, claiming that courts have required people to testify after they are given proper notice, which they argued happened in the case. The filing included two legal references that attorneys for Johnson said they could not verify. Reeves admitted to using AI to generate the citations to support his argument without verifying if they were accurate.

A coalition of hunters, fishers, mountain bikers, rock climbers, skiers, hikers, campers, wildlife lovers and more marched to the conference venue from nearby DeVargas Park, where the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance hosted a rally to oppose a Republican tax and spend proposal that would make more than 21,000 square miles of public land in New Mexico “eligible” to be sold to private buyers, according to a recent analysis.
New Mexico State Police unsuccessfully tried to stop the crowd from completely blocking West San Francisco Street and the entrance to El Dorado Hotel, where U.S. cabinet secretaries and state and territorial governors were gathered. Earlier in the day, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had given a keynote address to conference attendees, with no mention of the GOP proposal.
“This land is sacred, this land belongs to all of us, the water belongs to all of us,” Santa Clara Pueblo Gov. James Naranjo said at the rally. “They don’t belong to rich millionaires, they belong to the people of New Mexico and our visitors that come a long way to see our beautiful state, our beautiful culture, our beautiful ways of life.”
Speakers at the rally also opposed the Trump administration’s review of national monument protections, including buffer zones around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
“Please support us tribes,” Naranjo told the crowd. “We’re fighting for Chaco Canyon, we’re fighting for Bears Ears, Tent Rocks, Puye Cliffs, Bandelier, Valles Caldera. All our national parks are in jeopardy.”

Teresa Martinez, executive director and co-founder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, said when people stand up for the land, they also stand up for each other. She said 100 years from now, future generations need to know that the right people stood up at the right time to protect cherished natural landscapes.
“Because if we don’t do it, the wrong people will,” she said, gesturing to the hotel where the governors were meeting with Trump officials. “The people in that room are the wrong people, and they’re trying to do it right now.”
Lauren Leib, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 340, which represents federal Bureau of Land Management workers in New Mexico, called on all of the state and federal officials at the conference to stop the tax and spending legislation going through Congress called the “one big beautiful bill.”
“They’re using this rationale to propose selling off millions of acres of our public lands to offset the massive tax breaks for the 1%, and they’re doing that under the guise of creating affordable housing,” Leib said. “That’s now how you solve the housing crisis.”
Instead, she said, policymakers should enact rent control, living wages and regulations of the rich who can afford to buy up housing.
“They’re trying to steal your public lands to line their own pockets out of insatiable greed, and utter disdain for working class people like you and me,” she said.
Also during the rally, more than 100 nonprofit organizations delivered a letter to the 19 state leaders at the WGA conference, urging them to oppose the federal legislation. The letter warned that the proposal would allow an unprecedented disposal of public lands “with no environmental review, meaningful Tribal consultation, or public input.”
“It will take effect with lightning speed, forcing the immediate nomination of lands put up for auction within 30 days, all with no public process,” the letter states. “There are no requirements or safeguards that sold land be used for affordable housing. It’s an attack on the very values Westerners hold dear.”
Naranjo placed the struggle over public lands in the context of his people’s struggles against colonialism.
“We fought off the Spaniards. We fought off the U.S. government,” he said. “We fought off a lot of people in our day, my ancestors, and we’re still here.”

Thirty Freedom Summer workers based in Greenville, Mississippi, made the first effort to register Black voters in Drew. 
White men circled the workers in cars and trucks, some equipped with gun racks, making violent threats. One White man stopped his car and said, “I’ve got something here for you,” flashing his gun. 
Despite death threats and burning crosses, the workers persisted. During Freedom Summer, about 17,000 Black Mississippians attempted to register to vote, but only 1,600 were actually allowed to vote. These acts drew national attention to the state’s disenfranchisement of Black voters and contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

The state plans to double subsidies to films, which amount to half that.","When James Marshall discovered traces of gold in the American River in 1848, he ignited the famous California Gold Rush that attracted a tidal wave of immigration and led to statehood just two years later.
However, not everyone who made the arduous trek to California in the mid-19th century was seeking gold. Many — including those in the ill-fated 1846 Donner Party — wanted farmland.
Completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 made immigration into California and shipping produce out of the state much easier. As the gold rush quickly waned, agriculture became the state’s dominant industry, globally famous for fresh fruits and vegetables.
California’s vast network of reservoirs to capture water and canals to deliver it was originally created to help farmers prosper. They still use, by a wide margin, most of the system’s water.
While California is still No.1 in agricultural production among the states, generating about $60 billion a year, other sectors, such as technology, health care and logistics now play much larger roles in the state’s economy.
This is the time of year when crops are maturing and farmers are looking forward to harvests, shipments and paydays. But agricultural leaders see this year as one of the industry’s most trying periods, beset by economic and political factors that could significantly reduce production.
“When we talk about the things that are keeping me up at night, it really comes down to what is going to keep our members in business,” Shannon Douglass, president of the California Farm Bureau, said this month during a gathering of industry leaders.
She cited a federal census of agriculture which revealed California has lost 20% of its farmers in the last decade.  The industry is at a tipping point, she declared.
She also pointed to a study by researchers at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo that detailed rising costs of producing lettuce in the Salinas Valley due to government regulations. It found that costs of environmental, labor and food safety regulation are $1,600 per acre, up 63.7% since 2017, while income from lettuce has been virtually stagnant.
The list of factors affecting the industry also includes rising labor costs due to state wage regulations, new limits on pumping water from wells and demands from the state to reduce water diversions from rivers.
This year brought two new adverse factors — President Donald Trump’s tariffs that could generate retaliatory tariffs, depressing export markets, and Trump’s sweeps of undocumented immigrants, who are a major portion of the agricultural labor force.
Alexi Rodriguez, president of the Almond Alliance, told the gathering that China had been the top market for almonds until 2018, when an earlier round of Trump’s tariffs cut shipments. “After this year, China is likely to drop out of the top 10 export markets for almonds as a result,” she said.
The state’s labor costs also put California’s growers at a disadvantage.
“We’re sitting here in California and getting our brains beat in with costs that are through the roof and going up against my competitors in the East Coast paying $8 to $9 an hour for labor, and we’re dealing with the same customers,” said Mike Way, a bell pepper producer in the Coachella Valley. “What’s my choice? My choice is to shrink my acreage and go elsewhere.”
As agriculture’s acreage declined, so too did its economic importance and its once-dominant political clout vis-à-vis other economic interests. Efforts by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders to double state subsidies for the film industry underscore that decline.
Newsom, et al, says the subsidies are necessary to keep film production from declining further. The film industry pegs its economic contribution at $30 billion a year, just half of agriculture’s output.

Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, will face progressive faith leader Ryan Cagle in a special election Tuesday for Senate District 5, which covers Lamar, Fayette, Walker, the northern half of Tuscaloosa County, and the western part of Jefferson County.
The candidates offer differing visions for the district. Woods said he wants to continue and build on the district’s conservative leadership, while Cagle believes funding should be reprioritized to address longstanding issues in the community, like opioid misuse.

Where is the district located?
The north central Senate district includes Lamar, Fayette, Walker, the northern half of Tuscaloosa County and the western part of Jefferson County.
How did the seat become vacant?
Former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who had held the seat since 2010, stepped down at the beginning of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation. Reed’s role is transitioning the Department of Labor into the new Department of Workforce, with an aim at boosting Alabama’s labor force participation. Reed, who had led the Senate since 2021, was strongly allied with business interests and helped expand tax incentives and workforce training programs during his time in the Senate.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
The seat is strongly Republican. Reed first won the seat in 2010 as a first-time candidate with 73.3% of the votes. Reed subsequently ran unopposed in the Republican primaries and was not challenged by a Democratic candidate in 2014, 2018 and 2022, according to Ballotpedia.
What issues dominate the race?
Woods is campaigning on his legislative record and a platform of conservative leadership. He pointed to the “Alabama Child Protection Act,” a bill he sponsored that criminalized the creation, sharing or possession of child sexual abuse material, and his work on the “Parents’ Right to Know Act,” requiring schools to post classroom curricula online. Woods also pointed to his votes in favor of grocery tax cuts and the elimination of sales tax on feminine and baby products, saying that he is committed to cutting taxes. If elected, he intends to re-introduce legislation to increase penalties for violent threats to schools and to remove state sales tax on federally funded broadband equipment so that more grant money goes to infrastructure development.
Cagle is a first-time candidate advocating for the proper representation of working-class and vulnerable populations. He said he was concerned that current elected officials are not sufficiently engaged with on-the-ground issues like poverty and the opioid crisis. He criticized the influence of lobbyists and large corporations on state leadership and called for a reprioritization of state policies to better support communities. He also criticized the “CHOOSE Act” for expanding funding for private schools and homeschooling at the expense of public education.
What happens after today?

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) State policy calls for government agencies to log all moveable property that cost more than $1,000 within 60 days of its acquisition, but a recent review found Louisiana State Police has failed to keep an accurate inventory of such purchases for the past six years.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s review of the state Department of Public Safety, which was made public Monday, found that three major purchases were left off the books during the review period – a narcotics-detecting dog and two helicopters – with a total listed value of more than $9.43 million. 
The audit sampled 35 State Police movable property purchases between Sept. 29, 2023, and June 30, 2024. It found 10 items – including the helicopters and the drug-sniffing canine – were not logged into the state property system within 60 days. Of those 10, two were entered only after the auditor notified State Police.
The time it took for the assets to be logged as required ranged from 167 to 389 days.
In its response to the audit’s findings, Louisiana State Police said it would work with the Louisiana Property Assistance Agency to create movable property training tailored to its needs. More than 25,000 pieces of movable property are under State Police control, Maj. Nicole Kilgore, Support Services command inspector, said in response to the audit.
The Department of Public Safety review also discovered the Office of State Fire Marshall failed to timely certify and approve all time sheets – a finding the auditor has noted for three years running.
Between Oct. 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, the audit counted 558 out of 5,195 timesheets that were not certified by employees. Also, 999 timesheets – totaling $3.3 million in salaries, wages, leave and overtime pay – weren’t approved by a supervisor before they were submitted for payroll processing.
State Fire Marshal Ed Branch concurred with the auditor’s findings. He said his office has added timekeepers to assist employees and supervisors with adhering to state policy. Those who do not comply will be tracked and notified. 
“For repeat offenders, disciplinary action will be taken,” Branch wrote in response to the audit.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Louisiana-State-Police-relief-1024x754.jpg,,,2025-06-24 08:01:44.717732

The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada voted Monday to approve the utility’s request for a significant decrease in its deferred energy rate, an accounting method used by the utility to adjust for changes in the price of natural gas.  
The change will go into effect on July 1 and is expected to lower the average gas bill in Southern Nevada by more than $10 a month, and by more than $18 a month in Northern Nevada, according to PUC Hearing Officer Sam Crano.
The commission also approved a request from staff to investigate how NV Energy overcharged as many as 80,000 customers during the last two decades.
NV Energy, which services most of the state, overcharged some 60,000 customers by more than $17 million, disconnected service to some, and attempted to rectify the mistake by offering six months’ worth of refunds that amount to a fraction of what customers overpaid. The company informed regulators in late April that it overcharged another 20,000 customers an undisclosed amount.
“They won’t tell me how long I’ve been overcharged and how they came up with the $47 credit to my account,” Las Vegas resident Irwin Silver said during public comment. “I call up NV Energy and you give me the run around. They hang up on me.”
Chair Hailey Williamson announced the PUC’s general counsel recommended the commission grant staff’s request for an investigation.
“The scope of the investigation should include a focus on identifying the full extent of misclassifications of customers and how such misclassifications occurred, whether NV Energy misapplied its tariffs and appropriate remedies to avoid future misclassifications and compensate overcharged customers,” Williamson said. “I think this is incredibly important.”
PUC staff, through an investigation, “discovered that NV Energy has been overcharging tens of thousands of misclassified residential customers since as early as 2001,” according to the staff’s petition.
NV Energy, which says it completed an audit of the misclassifications in January, disclosed in late April that it overcharged some 20,000 “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.”
“Despite overcharging more than 80,000 customers for up to 23 years, NV Energy only provided refunds to a portion of affected customers. For the customers who received them, NV Energy capped refunds at six months, amounting to less than $2 million in refunds,” PUC staff asserted, adding the rule capping reimbursement to six months may not apply to customers in the north, and does not apply to customers in the south.
The skimpiness of the refunds triggered public outcry and caught the attention of the Nevada State Legislature, which approved Assembly Bill 452, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May. The law requires that customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges, address high utility bills by shifting some cost volatility back to utilities, and extend regulatory timelines for rate case reviews.
The PUC, however, already has the authority to order NV Energy to fully refund customers for the overcharge.
It’s unknown how the misclassification occurred, according to the petition, but it began in 2001 when the utility adopted its multi-family rate schedule. 
Between 2017 and 2024, NV Energy overcharged some 59,939 customers across 22,101 premises just over $17 million because it misclassified the multifamily residences as single-family. 
During the same period, NV Energy undercharged 5,438 customers across 2,451 premises for just over $2.5 million because it misclassified single-family residences as multi-family.
The utility released a public statement saying it “promptly refunded the overcharged customers in accordance with the applicable rules and is not seeking repayment by those customers who were undercharged.” 
NV Energy did not publicly disclose that the amount undercharged was a fraction (12.4%) of the amount overcharged, according to PUC staff. 
“In addition to financial harm, NV Energy disconnected service for a substantial number of injured customers due to nonpayment. Between April 1, 2017 and April 1, 2024, NV Energy disconnected service to 3,177 of the 59,939 customers who overpaid,” staff wrote in its petition.
Staff writes that given the number of affected customers disconnected for nonpayment, “it is reasonable to infer that overbilling contributed to, if not caused, nonpayment and related service disconnections in some cases.” 
Staff contends NV Energy used an inapplicable rule to cap refunds at six months, “denying tens of thousands of known injured customers millions of dollars of measurable financial losses…” 
The utility did not notify PUC staff of the mistake, but instead unilaterally applied the six-month rule. 
The PUC can issue administrative fines against NV Energy, require the utility to make customers whole, and impose any other remedy available. 
Staff is recommending the Commission order NV Energy to fully refund affected customers as a sanction.
“NV Energy is committed to working with our regulators through a transparent process that provides a fair and balanced outcome for the impacted customers and will continue working with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada through the recently opened investigatory docket,” the utility’s spokesperson Meghin Delaney said in a statement Monday. “We continue to review customer accounts to correct any remaining miscoded properties and to implement controls and process improvements to help avoid this type of error in the future.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/natural-gas-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 08:01:44.717732

Critics say it would criminalize legitimate criticism of Israel.,"Assemblyman Gary Schaer, a bill sponsor, said he is disappointed a vote on it was postponed yet again. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Trenton lawmakers heard nearly three more hours of debate Monday on a controversial bill that would establish a specific definition of antisemitism in state law, but they did not take a vote on the measure.
Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic), the bill’s chief sponsor, said he was surprised by the decision not to move forward with a vote. Schaer introduced the bill in February 2024 and has previously expressed frustration that it has not yet been voted on by the Assembly’s community development committee.
“The bill before you is well over a year old. Within that period of time, it seems to me that there has been ample time for members to debate the merits as well as the disadvantages of this bill or any other bill,” Schaer said.
Those who testified echoed similar sentiments.
The bill, which has more than 50 cosponsors, would require that the state recognize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism to aid investigators trying to determine if a crime has been motivated by antisemitic bias. Its Senate companion cleared a committee in that chamber one year ago after nine hours of testimony.
Critics say the bill improperly conflates criticism of Israel with antisemitism and would criminalize protests against Israel. Basma Bsharat is the education director at the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton.
“Do not criminalize our story,” Bsharat said during a committee hearing Monday.
The committee also heard from Sadaf Jaffar, a former New Jersey assemblywoman and mayor.
“All good and decent people stand against hate, including antisemitism. This is not what this legislation is about,” Jaffar said. “We do not have a definition of antiblack racism or antiimmigrant hate. This does not stop hate crimes from being prosecuted, as they should be.”
Supporters of the bill argued that members of the Jewish community live in fear of attacks because of their religion, and said this legislation would serve as protection against that violence. 
“We are at a moment where Jewish families are scared to send our kids to school, attend synagogue, or simply live our daily lives without fear of hate and violence,” Katie Katz, the executive director at Teach NJ, said to the committee.
In an April report, the Anti-Defamation League said there were 719 total reported antisemitic incidents in New Jersey in 2024. Though that represents a 13% dip from 2023, the Anti-Defamation League said it was the third-highest number recorded in any state nationwide last year and the second-highest ever recorded in New Jersey.
Jason Shames is the CEO and executive vice president of the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey.
“You know exactly what is going on in our community with Jews being harassed on the street all over the place just for being Jewish, not just for support of Israel,” Shames told lawmakers Monday.

It takes just one boat carrying an invasive to add another pristine lake to the list of infested water bodies.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pat Suozzi: Big waves, aquatic invasives and Vermont’s home lake rule.","This commentary is by Pat Suozzi of Hinesburg, president of the Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds.


Picture this: a motorboat puts into Lake Champlain. As you watch it move out towards the middle of the lake, you notice something odd happens: its stern is down, and its bow is up. 
As it moves slowly along, you realize that it is producing very large waves and that rather than a water skier, there is a person on a small board apparently surfing on the boat’s large wake. What you are observing is a wake boat in wake sports mode.
The mechanism that allows wake boats to create these waves are ballast tanks that are filled with lake water when a boat enters a lake. Once the boater is ready to leave the lake, those ballast tanks are emptied. However, there is a problem. 
Those ballast tanks — and wake boats usually have multiple tanks — cannot be fully emptied, always leaving some residual water. If that boat filled its tanks in a lake infested with an aquatic invasive species that boat could potentially carry those invasives to the next lake the boat enters.  
The definition of an aquatic invasive species is that it has no natural predators, proliferates quickly, damages ecosystems and provides no nutrition or support for native fish or wildlife. Even very small fragments of an invasive like Eurasian watermilfoil or a few zebra mussel larvae, if carried into a lake in a ballast tank, can spawn a serious infestation.
However, this does not have to happen. Vermont has a rule to prevent this very scenario.
In the spring of 2024, the state approved new rules to regulate wake boats including the home lake provision specifically intended to prevent wake boats from carrying aquatic invasive species from lake to lake. The home lake provision requires that all wake boats select one home lake where it will operate. If a wake boat owner wishes to operate in a different lake, they must show proof that the wake boat has been properly decontaminated.
Unfortunately, the Agency of Natural Resources chose not to implement this provision of the rule last year due to lack of time.
Yet here we are in June of 2025, and the agency has once again announced that it will not implement the home lake provision despite many of the lake associations on affected lakes repeatedly offering to work with the agency to shoulder much of the burden of implementation.
Why so much concern? After all, as far as we know, wake boats comprise a very small number of boats on the state’s lakes, although they are growing in popularity.
The reason is that an invasive infestation can harm a lake’s ecosystem, damage fisheries, make recreational use unpleasant or impossible and can cause economic harm to surrounding communities.
We are amazingly fortunate here in Vermont to have so many still pristine and uninfested lakes. Yet the Agency of Natural Resources, the agency specifically charged by law to protect Vermont’s lakes and to stop the spread of aquatic invasives, has again chosen to put the state’s precious water resources at risk. It takes just one boat carrying an invasive to add another pristine lake to the list of infested water bodies.
With the boating season already well underway, what can be done?
If you love Vermont lakes you can help to stop the spread by making sure that all your aquatic gear: boats, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, and even life jackets and children’s toys, are cleaned, drained and dried whenever they leave a waterbody and before they enter another.
If you go to a lake with Greeters, stop and talk with them. The Greeters, managed by volunteer lake associations, are trained to inspect and clean aquatic gear and can also provide information about whether a lake is infested with an invasive and, if so, the best ways to avoid spreading it.
Finally, a few special requests to wake boat owners: please consider keeping your boat on just one lake this summer, especially if you have used your boat in wake sport mode in an infested lake. If that is not possible, please drain your ballast tanks as fully as you can and keep your boat out of the water for at least 14 days to allow any invasives to die. Also, keep in mind that wake boats’ enhanced wakes can cause shoreline erosion issues, and can be dangerous to other lake users — so please perform all wake sports in the lake’s designated wake sport zone.
Our lakes are the jewels of Vermont. All of us working together can protect these very special resources.

That’s the word from a preliminary report recently published by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee.
Nearly three-quarters of acute care hospital inspections were late, as of December, according to the committee. One facility hadn’t gotten a state inspection since early 2018.
What this lag means for health outcomes is unknown, the report says. 
The check-ups involve registered nurses who focus on patient care and other inspectors who look at everything from staff training to cleanliness.
The audit also found delays in inspecting behavioral health hospitals, a backlog in uninvestigated complaints about hospitals and that state hospital data could be more accessible online. Many of the issues are driven by a lack of staff.
Before the pandemic, the state inspected 81% of acute care hospitals on time, but that dropped to 28% by the end of 2024, according to a committee analysis of state Department of Health data.
The health department has to inspect each acute care hospital “on average, at least every 18 months,” under state law. From May 2021 through 2024, the state was averaging 31 inspections per year, down from 41 per year before the pandemic, according to the report. Washington had 93 acute care hospitals at the beginning of this year.
In one example of the inspections, committee staff accompanied six inspectors as they made an unannounced three-day visit at a 400-bed hospital. They evaluated dialysis and colonoscopy processes, sterilization of equipment and drug administration.
The Washington State Hospital Association noted other state agencies, including the Department of Labor and Industries and the Health Care Authority, also provide hospital oversight. 
“Hospitals are inspected frequently enough that they often must request state agencies coordinate so they are not on site at the same time,” spokesperson Tim Pfarr said.
Hospitals are allowed to count federally required outside inspections once every three years in lieu of a state check-in. But the state hasn’t verified that these accredited non-state inspectors follow similar standards to Washington’s requirements, the report found. 
And when hospitals get these outside inspections, they must prove they passed, but the state says most hospitals don’t provide that evidence and it doesn’t keep track of which hospitals do, the audit found. Without these reports, inspectors may be unaware of more recent problems.
The Department of Health attributes the holdup to an overworked staff and increasing inspection needs as hospitals expand their services. Inspectors also examine other medical facilities separate from hospitals. The agency expects to reach the 18-month timeline for most hospitals by 2028 or 2029.
State law also requires the agency to inspect each behavioral health hospital every year, but it hasn’t met that goal since 2018. Inspectors have made progress since the pandemic. Last year, they evaluated eight of 10 such hospitals.
The audit committee suggests the Legislature fine-tune the law on hospital inspection frequency. For example, the statute doesn’t specify the maximum amount of time that can pass between inspections.
The Department of Health declined to comment on the findings as the report is not yet finalized.
The final report will likely be published in July. State lawmakers ordered the audit in 2022.
Complaints and errors
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee also examined how the state handles complaints against hospitals. Grievances range from patient neglect and injuries to medication errors and other mistakes. 
As these complaints have increased over the past decade, the department completed reviews of 80% of complaints within its goal of 170 days, according to the report, but also faces a backlog of more minor allegations to probe. A lack of complaints reported in languages other than English may also signal access barriers.
Washington’s 103 acute care and behavioral health hospitals pay for their own state oversight through annual licensing fees. The Department of Health hiked these fees last year to help staff up the unit investigating complaints against hospitals. 
When fully staffed, the department has 10 staff each inspecting medical facilities and looking into complaints. But the inspections unit has only been fully staffed one of the past eight years.
Washington has also seen hospital reports of their own avoidable medical errors jump dramatically in recent years. These errors, known as “adverse health events,” include issues like bed sores and mistakes with medication.
The Department of Health is supposed to investigate these reports and review hospitals’ plans for preventing similar problems in the future. But the agency doesn’t do that, undercutting an opportunity to identify common problems at hospitals and take steps to prevent them, the report found.
The issue is money. The Legislature hasn’t provided dedicated funding for this work in years, despite requests from the health department.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 08:01:44.717732

The House of Representatives took the two most vital votes of the year without record.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lachlan Francis: It’s time for electronic voting and transparency in the Legislature.","This commentary is by Lachlan Francis of Westminster. He is chair of the Windham County Democratic Committee and a member of the Vermont State Democratic Committee.


This legislative session made one thing very clear: it is time for electronic voting in Montpelier. While this is nothing new, our esteemed legislators are far too comfortable casting votes that will never be recorded, denying their constituents the opportunity to be fully informed about how they are represented. 
Take, for example, a few of the most high profile issues of this past legislative session. In January, we know from reporting that 18 Vermont legislators voted to overturn the 2024 election for Lieutenant Governor, yet the identity of those 18 is forever concealed because it was done via secret ballot.
That vote came just months after many Democratic and Progressive legislators were telling their constituents that “Democracy is on the line” in the 2024 elections — and yet, roughly one in five of them voted to overturn the election as a first order of business in 2025, despite a margin of six thousand votes, nearly 2% of the statewide electorate. We will never know who these 18 election deniers were.
More recently, after having spent months debating the education transformation bill — the singular policy debate of the year — the House of Representatives took the two most vital votes of the year without record.
First, to suspend the rules so that they could consider a conference committee bill that overstepped the procedural boundaries of such a bill, they held a “vote by division” — meaning supporters stood and were counted, then sat, and then opponents stood and were counted. None of which, of course, was written down.
Within seconds, a voice vote on the entire package was called, and it was deemed that the “ayes” had it, sealing the bill’s fate without a single recorded vote in the House. This prompted outcry from some members, and ultimately a roll call vote was held on the procedural issue of whether to send the bill to the governor for his signature. 
Legislators who are embarrassed by that lack of transparency have already attempted to claim that the procedural roll call vote should be deemed the vote of record — it’s better than nothing, but it’s a certainty that some legislators voted one way on the rules suspension and adoption votes, then another on the procedural vote. For example, there were 113 “aye” votes to suspend the rules, but only 96 “aye” votes on the procedural motion.
What’s worse is that, in both of the instances above, multiple legislators have told me and others that it happened because they were not sure what they were voting on at the time that they voted. That is even more concerning, and more reason for an electronic voting system that would make the process faster and more transparent for legislators and citizens alike. 
Nearly every other state utilizes electronic voting in their legislative assemblies, and Vermont has a bipartisan bill — introduced by Democrat Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney, and Republican Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden — that would mandate such a system in the Vermont House. Both chambers in Montpelier should adopt such a system before they further embarrass themselves.

(Photo courtesy of Department of Corrections)Washington state’s parole board this week will hear the case of one of the so-called “Hillside Stranglers” who murdered numerous women and girls, including two in Washington, in the late 1970s.
Anthony D’Amato and his cousin, Angelo Buono, were convicted of strangling five people to death in southern California. D’Amato, who was suspected of several other murders but never convicted, killed two more women by himself in the Bellingham area. D’Amato, now 74, changed his name from Kenneth Bianchi in 2023.
Washington’s Indeterminate Sentence Review Board will consider parole for D’Amato on Wednesday. He’s currently held at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.
The hearing was previously scheduled for late May, but postponed. As is standard, it will be closed to the general public. The result of the hearing will be posted online by July 23, according to the board.
After raping and killing women in the Los Angeles area, D’Amato was working as a security guard in Bellingham in January 1979. While there, he lured two Western Washington University students, Karen Mandic and Diane Wilder, into a home and strangled them to death. Their murders led police to connect D’Amato to around 10 similar cases in California.
D’Amato pleaded guilty to the killings in Washington state court to escape the death penalty. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

In 1990, the review board revised his life imprisonment to a sentence of more than 118 years due to a change in state law. With credit for good behavior, his release is set for 2065, when he would be 114 years old, according to the state Department of Corrections.
If the board decides against parole, more time could be added to his sentence.
In his decades incarcerated, D’Amato has challenged his Washington convictions on numerous grounds, including by claiming his confession was the product of hypnosis. He’s repeatedly maintained he’s innocent.
The board has denied D’Amato’s parole requests multiple times in recent years.
If ever released from Washington custody, D’Amato would serve separate life sentences in California. He is also set for a parole hearing in California next month for the five murder charges to which he pleaded guilty there, where he has previously been denied relief.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
Following the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly nine in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than four in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training, and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is now law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

But counties have struggled to foot the bill themselves in lower-level cases.,"(Getty Images)Beginning next month — and for the first time in nearly 30 years — nine Indiana counties will enjoy partial state reimbursement for spending on public defenders for destitute Hoosiers accused of misdemeanors.
The U.S. and Indiana constitutions afford those facing criminal charges the right to public defense when they can’t afford it themselves.
Counties can draw on the Indiana Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys to help pay for public defense in death penalty, felony and child abuse cases — but they’re on their own for misdemeanors.
That’s changing via a limited pilot program.
Its backers hope to build a case for long-term reimbursement.
  Derrick Mason (Courtesy Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys)
The commission’s “top priority” is to guarantee enough funding “for our core mission of reimbursing all counties that comply with our standards for the entire 40% of their eligible public defense expenses,” Executive Director Derrick Mason said in a news release.
“We intend to achieve that mission by continuing to ensure constitutionally protected, effective public defense services are provided,” he continued. Commission data has shown that doing so “ultimately saves taxpayer dollars at both the state and county level.”
Program takes shape
Clark, DeKalb, Floyd, Lawrence, Perry, Pulaski, Steuben, Vigo, and Wabash counties will be eligible for 18 months of 40% reimbursement as part of an initiative authorized last year.
That’s in exchange for agreeing to abide by attorney caseload and compensation standards set by the commission. They must also send data on how the reimbursement has impacted attorney appointment rates, jail population, trial rates, and case outcomes for a report due by 2029.
“The overall goal of the pilot is to gather data to determine whether (commission) reimbursement to counties, in exchange for the county following standards in the representation of people charged with misdemeanors, produces improved outcomes in Indiana’s criminal justice system,” the news release explained.
The nine selections were finalized at a meeting last Wednesday.
Senate Enrolled Act 179, enacted in 2024, required the commission to consider population and geographic diversity.
Staff also prioritized counties with track records of strong leadership, effective communication and accurate, on-time reimbursement requests, according to meeting materials.
Indiana to pilot return to misdemeanor defense reimbursement

One table featured red-to-green color-coding for the 21 applicants based on how highly they were recommended for the pilot. Clark County was lauded as a “unique opportunity,” for example, while several unsuccessful counties were knocked for data errors and noncompliance.
It’s a smaller pilot than authorized.
The statute lets the commission pick up to 12 participants for a four-year pilot. But the agency chose nine, and it’ll last for less than half the time.
The news release cited “budget cuts.” Most agencies were dealt a 5% cut after a grim revenue forecast forced budget architects to scale back spending — and they’ve been directed to withhold an additional 5%.
But participation could be renewed after the initial 18-month term, based on each county’s success and upon the commission’s budget, per the news release. Meeting materials noted that if some participants can’t follow through, the commission could replace them or just let the pilot shrink.
The pilot could also grow if there’s enough money.
Last year, when it was setting up the pilot, the commission envisioned funding it with a pandemic-era surplus and recently doubled fees paid by some Hoosiers assigned public defense.

'How do you teach biology? How do you teach sociology or literature? Are William Faulkner's books banned?'","A federal judge will hear arguments Tuesday over enforcement of a new law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs from Mississippi public schools and universities.
A coalition of civil rights and legal organizations, on behalf of students, parents and educators, is asking U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing state officials from enforcing the mandate. American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and partner legal groups filed the lawsuit on June 9 against the state’s education boards. 
House Bill 1193, which was passed after heated debate during the 2025 legislative session, prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices, engaging in “divisive” concepts and hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin. It also enshrines in law the teaching that there are two genders — male and female.
The hearing comes after the state Board of Education and the Institutions of Higher Learning, to comply with the law, voted last week to approve policies that create a complaint and investigation process for violations. Now local school boards will have to come up with their own policies that comply with the new law.
Rob McDuff, a Mississippi Center for Justice attorney on the case, said a temporary pause would benefit both parties in the lawsuit. 
“This is going to be a real pain to enforce,” he said. “We’re asking the judge to put a pause on it until we can dive into the legal issues and resolve them. I think that would be in everybody’s interest.”
McDuff said he’s concerned that the policy adopted by the state education board is going to lead to a wave of complaints, and there are still a number of issues with the law itself. For example, the civil rights attorney said, there’s no explanation of how to cure a violation in the bill, which could lead to different interpretations. And the consequences are dire — state money will be withheld from any school with two violations or more until those schools return to compliance.
While other states have adopted similar laws as part of a national anti-DEI trend, McDuff said Mississippi’s law restricts the normal classroom teacher far more than other laws he’s reviewed. 
“This opens the door to ideological warfare on campuses,” he said. “How do you teach biology? How do you teach sociology or literature? Are William Faulkner’s books banned?”
Professors and school officials, including Laura Mammina, a history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, provided written comments to education officials opposing the bill.
“As it currently stands, the policy, like the law, is a gross violation of the United States Constitution,” she wrote. “This issue will impact the quality of education in our state, and have effects on current students that may last for decades to come.” 
Jackson Public Schools’ deputy superintendent Michael Cormack Jr. asked a number of questions of the state education department’s chief of advocacy and counsel, Erin Meyer, in his public comment about the new policy, including whether or not the district could still celebrate Black History Month and if one of the district’s core values, “equity,” put them out of compliance. 
He also asked whether teaching about the causes of the Civil War is no longer allowed under HB 1193 and if the district’s effort to hire more male teachers was prohibited by the new law.
State Rep. Kabir Karriem, who leads the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, said the bill is a step backwards. His organization also submitted a comment opposing the policy.

When recognizing the rights of people as citizens, we have a lot of examples. At the inception of our distinguished nation, the preamble of the U.S. Constitution was established: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”
Missouri became the 24th state in 1821. Our state motto, carved in Latin into the ceiling of the state capital rotunda, reads: “Salus Populi Suprema lex Esto,” which means “The Welfare of the People Shall be the Supreme Law.”
This principle shows Missouri’s commitment to its citizens’ well-being. It reflects the values in the Constitution and should guide our elected representatives in Jefferson City. However, a state representative told me, “You only have as many rights as you have money and political power.”
The influence of money is clear in how Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are regulated and how they manage the large amounts of waste they produce.
In the early 2000s, rural citizens and family farmers negatively affected by CAFO pollution sued and won. But in 2011, the Missouri legislature changed the law to prevent people from suing over the loss of enjoyment of their property due to CAFOs. This change shows how money and power can overshadow the rights and well-being of Missouri citizens. The principles in Missouri’s motto and the state and U.S. Constitutions are ignored when economic power dictates our rights.
For CAFOs, the environmental and health impacts on nearby residents are often ignored. Corporate interests override the voices of communities, leaving them to deal with pollution and a declining quality of life. Legal victories once provided hope, but later changes in laws remind us how fragile justice is against powerful special interests.
In 2013, the corporate takeover of rural communities began with allowing foreign corporations to own 1% of Missouri farmland — which was at the time 289,000 acres. Shuanghui International, now WH Group, quickly bought Smithfield Foods, amassing over 40,000 acres of Missouri farmland.
In 2014, the “Right to Farm” constitutional amendment was introduced. Its deceptive language seemed to give CAFOs and foreign corporations free reign.
Then, in 2019, the Missouri legislature passed a bill outlawing “local control” over CAFOs. This bill stripped counties of their ability to protect citizens through local health ordinances. These rules limited CAFO setbacks from water sources, homes, schools, and churches. Counties could not enforce any protections stronger than Missouri’s weak regulations.
Communities across Missouri have voiced concerns as CAFOs intrude into neighborhoods.
Just since 2023, 22 CAFO permits have been proposed for Barry, Lawrence, McDonald and Newton counties, and the seven permits currently being considered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would allow 52 new barns and a whopping 2.5 million chickens in Lawrence and Newton.
This is an unacceptable level of concentration and density in the area. A key concern is our karst topography, which includes caves and underground rivers. CAFO waste could significantly  contaminate our groundwater according to the DNR’s own report..
This raises critical questions about the role of government and elected “representatives” in safeguarding the rights of Missourians. Are they truly representatives of the people, justice and welfare, or are they succumbing to external pressures that compromise the foundational ideals of our democratic process? It is in these moments that the responsibility of civic engagement becomes paramount, urging citizens to hold their representatives accountable and ensure that the welfare of the people remains the supreme law.
It may not be in your backyard now, but if we don’t act, it could be in your next glass of water.
This is a statewide issue. If the DNR is unwilling to do their job, then we need a legislative fix. A departmental resolution should be just the beginning. We need to repeal the 2019 law and let local governments address this problem.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hog-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 06:58:55.560802
,New Jersey Monitor,2025-06-24 10:51:52+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"Federal anti-abortion crusade endangers New Jersey protections, advocates warn",Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/06/24/federal-anti-abortion-crusade-endangers-new-jersey-protections-advocates-warn/,"Momentum on state legislation to expand abortion protections has stalled, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling and as federal attacks mount.","Momentum on state legislation to expand abortion protections has stalled, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling and as federal attacks mount. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion three years ago in a landmark ruling known as Dobbs, the national conversation on reproductive rights has centered on states that have banned or restricted the procedure.
That largely excludes states like New Jersey where Dobbs drove state legislators to protect and expand abortion access. But the Trump administration’s crusade to torpedo Democratic policies nationwide has ignited fears in New Jersey that those abortion protections could fall.
“Those laws are untested, so we don’t even know how they will hold up,” said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. “We are attuned to the fact that we may need new responses to this administration, because the attacks have been really unprecedented and just really draconian and cruel.”
A bit of paralysis on this issue has set in at the Trenton Statehouse since President Trump retook the White House in January, with legislators taking no action this year on nine bills they announced last June that are intended to expand abortion protections here.
The bills’ supporters say the legislative inaction cannot continue if New Jersey wants to remain a state that can brag about its reproductive rights protections — as it has done on billboards in states like Texas, where abortion is largely banned.
“It’s not a moment to sleep on our laurels,” said Alejandra Sorto of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “We need immediate and courageous action against what’s happening at the federal level. It isn’t a wait-and-see moment at all.”

 Federal threats

Trump’s crackdown on immigration has been his most visible agenda priority, but a crackdown on abortion rights has been underway, too, even though Trump had vowed during his campaign to leave abortion policy to states.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin has fought the Trump administration on abortion rights, joining a multi-state petition to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to drop restrictions on the abortion medication mifepristone and battling anti-abortion pregnancy centers in court.
Still, abortion rights advocates said New Jersey patients could feel the repercussions of national restrictions soon.
Sorto, the ACLU-NJ’s associate director of civic engagement, pointed to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent order for the FDA to review mifepristone. Such medications are used in about two-thirds of pregnancy terminations.
The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit last year to restrict mifepristone, but abortion rights advocates fear the Trump administration could revoke federal approval of the drug. Gov. Phil Murphy said in January that New Jersey would begin stockpiling mifepristone “so every woman can access this crucial form of reproductive care.”
Wojtowicz warned that threats to yank Planned Parenthood’s funding also threaten access here. The budget bill now before Congress would cut Medicaid funding to nonprofit abortion providers.
“It doesn’t name Planned Parenthood directly, but it’s tailored in such a way that it’s really targeting Planned Parenthood health centers,” Wojtowicz said.
Those cuts could force up to 200 Planned Parenthood clinics to close across the country, she said. The nonprofit, which has 23 health centers in New Jersey, is a significant provider of abortion in the Garden State. About a third of Planned Parenthood patients here rely on Medicaid, Wojtowicz said.
Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers around the country already had lost substantial funding during the first Trump presidency.
“It’s devastating for access. This isn’t a red-state or blue-state thing. This is an everywhere issue,” Wojtowicz said. “We don’t see this as an ‘if Planned Parenthood is defunded’ issue. We see it as a ‘when.’”
New Jersey residents seeking abortions also should be concerned about security — both the privacy of their patient data and their physical safety, said Brittany Holom-Trundy, a senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective.
She pointed to the Trump administration sharing Medicaid enrollee data with deportation officials, as well as controversial data-mining the administration has done with impacts that aren’t fully clear yet. And in a ruling this month that applies nationally, a federal judge in Texas struck down a 2024 federal rule that shielded reproductive health information from disclosure to law enforcement when care was legally obtained, such as in another state with abortion access.
The Trump administration also has largely stopped enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a 1994 federal law that set criminal penalties for people who harass or threaten anyone entering or leaving an abortion clinic. Trump in January pardoned 23 people convicted under the act.
“This is a scary time for that aspect of things,” Holom-Trundy said.
One of the bills now stalled in Trenton would strengthen data privacy for patients who receive reproductive health care. Another would essentially codify the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act here.
“We need to protect data security, making sure data can’t be accessed or taken, but we also need to protect physical security, of providers and patients,” Holom-Trundy said. “We need to ensure that we as a state are ensuring that people don’t fear seeking the care that they need, and that they won’t be targeted by political violence when they do so.”
 Senate President Nicholas Scutari said he is “as pro-choice as they come” and would agree to a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in New Jersey. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
 Meanwhile, in Trenton …

Even before Dobbs, New Jersey legislators had acted to codify the right to abortion into state law. Other protections followed, including a mandate requiring some health insurers to cover abortion care in full and a law banning the extradition of people who get or give abortions in New Jersey to states that criminalize it.
Rising abortion rates suggest some of those laws are working. Abortion providers in New Jersey performed close to 5,000 abortions a month by last December, up from about 4,000 terminations a month before Dobbs, new data from the Society of Family Planning shows.
“We’re seeing people from places where we just never would have before, like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio,” Wojtowicz said.
One measure in the nine-bill package now stalled in Trenton could help abortion providers fundraise. It would allow New Jersey taxpayers to donate part or all of their refund to a state abortion fund, and proceeds would be distributed annually to the three reproductive health providers in New Jersey who serve the most Medicaid patients.
Other bills in the “Reproductive Freedom and Health Equity” package would make abortion more accessible on college campuses and create a new crime for those who interfere with reproductive care.
The Assembly hasn’t acted on any of the bills since they were introduced last June. The Senate stalled on them after passing one and advancing four others in committee.
Holom-Trundy suspects the Trump administration’s unpredictability has derailed momentum on state legislation.
“I’m always frustrated by a lack of movement on important things,” Holom-Trundy said. “Uncertainty can cause a paralysis. Uncertainty can lead people to say, ‘Let’s just wait and see,’ and take a more reactive approach to what happens outside of their control. I would encourage them to instead take a proactive approach. Even though you can’t predict right now exactly what’s going to happen, you can see that there are threats to this care and to access and to security and to privacy.”
Democrats Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Assemblywoman Shanique Speight, prime sponsor on all nine bills, did not respond to requests for comment.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who wields great power over what legislation moves as Senate President, told the New Jersey Monitor he’s “as pro-choice as they come” and had been willing to seek an amendment to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.
He also gave a chilling nod to the volatility of abortion politics now.
“Don’t try to get me killed out here. I mean, that’s what killed those people in Minnesota,” he said.
A gunman assassinated a Minnesota state legislator and her husband and seriously wounded another legislator and his wife earlier this month in a rampage investigators suspect was motivated by anti-abortion extremism. The gunman, who was arrested, also planned to target abortion providers, investigators said.
Scutari said he wasn’t holding up the bills for any particular reason but added: “If the Assembly doesn’t move anything, sometimes we’re like: ‘Well, we’re wasting time and energy that we could have for other bills.’”
“I can’t really speak to the specific bills, because I only have, like, 7,000 to review, but in the general sense, I’m always in favor of additional pro-choice protections,” he said. “If there’s more that needs to be done, and the sponsors contact me about it, I will never stand in the way of that.”
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), prime sponsor on all nine bills, said she wants to see them become law before a new governor replaces Murphy in January. Lawmakers now are preoccupied with passing a state budget, as they must do by the end of June, and then will recess for the summer, she added. She expects the reproductive rights bills will become a legislative priority in the fall.
“We know what’s at stake here and what we have to do to protect New Jersey,” Ruiz said.
Murphy has urged legislators to act on one of the bills — a measure to eliminate copays for reproductive health care — in state-of-the-state addresses this year and last year.
His budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 includes more than $50 million for family planning services, facility upgrades, and growing the reproductive health care workforce, said Murphy spokeswoman Natalie Hamilton.
“Three years after the disastrous Dobbs decision, Governor Murphy is eager to sign additional legislation further protecting and expanding reproductive rights and health care access in New Jersey. He urges the Legislature to act without delay,” Hamilton said.

Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So, in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.
“I was there when they opened,” Beckham recalled. After getting her Zostavax shot, she said, “I felt really relieved.” She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as a pneumonia shot, an RSV vaccine to guard against respiratory syncytial virus, annual flu shots and all recommended covid-19 vaccinations.
Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.
Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, California, has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. “I’m sort of hectoring,” she acknowledged.
Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, in case her immunity to measles had waned.
For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody foresaw.
The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt.
On June 9, Kennedy fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later replaced them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans.
The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.
The phrase “Vaccines are not just for kids anymore” has become a favorite for William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
“The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness,” he said.
Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them seniors, and is fatal to 10% of hospitalized older adults.
For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people 65 and older. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they’re recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels.
In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, “all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations,” said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study.
Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu in older adults, by at least 11% and up to 18%. The CDC advises adults 65 and older to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.
More good news: Vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus in people 60 and older are performing admirably.
RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. “Season in and season out,” Schaffner said, “it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza.”
Because the FDA first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided “the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context,” said Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open.
In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.
The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.
Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, “shouldn’t dissuade people.”
The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they’re at higher risk of severe illness (from, say, heart disease).
As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine whether the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.
People 65 and up express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were “very “or “somewhat confident” about MMR, shingles, pneumonia, and flu shots.
Although the covid vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.
Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines.
Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. “People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated,” said Pascal Geldsetzer, an epidemiologist at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study.
“It’s hard to know whether this is cause and effect,” he said, “or whether they’re less likely to develop dementia anyway.”
So the Stanford team took advantage of a “natural experiment” when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren’t eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible.
In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.
“Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way,” Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes “more powerful and convincing evidence,” he said.
The team also found reduced rates of dementia after shingles vaccines were introduced in Australia and other countries. “We keep seeing this in one dataset after another,” Geldsetzer said.
In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.
By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group.
How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation.
“I don’t think anybody knows,” said Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, “I’m now convinced there’s something real here.”
Shingrix, now recommended for adults over 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of adults 60 and older had received one dose of either shingles vaccine.
A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.
And “if you needed another reason to get this vaccine,” Schaffner said, “here it is.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)As a warming planet delivers more wildfires, hurricanes, and other threats, America’s once reliably boring home insurance market has become the place where climate shocks collide with people’s pocketbooks. 
The turmoil in insurance markets is a harbinger for an American economy that is built on real property. Without insurance, banks won’t issue a mortgage; without a mortgage, most people can’t buy a home. Communities that are deemed too dangerous to insure face the risk of falling property values, which means less tax dollars for schools, police and other basic services.                  
Oklahoma is now estimated to have the highest average cost of homeowners insurance in the United States. One recent analysis found Oklahomans pay an average of $6,210 per year. 
The national average for homeowners insurance, by the way, is $2,110 a year, according to the NerdWallet analysis. That means Oklahomans are paying 194% more than other American homeowners. The online site, which provides financial resources, said it looked at pricing data from over 100 insurance companies to calculate the average insurance cost. They looked at quotes for a 40-year-old that had good credit and needed $300,000 in both dwelling and liability coverage and who wanted a $1,000 deductible.
Enid has an unhappy distinction of being the place in Oklahoma where insurance is more costly than pretty much everywhere else in America.
Enid is certainly not a place that is unusually subject to severe weather. In fact, the federal government designates Garfield County, which includes Enid, as having a “relatively low” level of risk. Yet as the New York Times reported last year, as a percentage of home prices, insurance is more expensive in sections of Enid, than it was in a wildfire-ravaged area of California, the hurricane-prone New Orleans and Florida Keys, and North Carolina’s Outer Banks, which is grappling with homes sinking into the sea.
That same New York Times article cited federal data which showed that Oklahomans who live along the borders paid premiums 70% higher compared to residents living just over the state line in Arkansas, Kansas and Texas. Those counties had comparable exposure risks to natural disasters.                
It’s clear that climate change has increasingly produced damaging weather which can account, at least in part, for the drastic increase in home insurance, but there’s another reason that could explain Oklahoma’s skyrocketing costs. 
Recent research points to a surprising factor: Higher premiums are charged in states, like Oklahoma, where regulators are more lax in examining requests for rate increases. That means in Oklahoma insurers are basically able to charge whatever they want.
Glen Mulready, Oklahoma’s current insurance commissioner, has never once blocked an insurers’ rate increase request. In defending this position, he told The New York Times last year that it’s not his job to stop private insurance companies from raising rates. His belief is that competitive market forces, not regulation, is the best way to limit prices. 
It should be noted that from 2019 to 2022 Mulready received over $60,000 in political contributions from the insurance industry, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan group Open Secrets, which analyzes donor data. Those are the same folks he is supposed to regulate. Most of use would view this as a clear conflict of interest.
Ishita Sen, a professor at Harvard Business School, has found in her research that insurers do not adjust rates in highly-regulated states but rather compensate by raising them in less-regulated states. 
In a tightly regulated state, such as California, premiums tend to be priced below what they would be if they truly reflected the likelihood of damage from storms, fires or other disasters. She also discovered that after big losses in strongly regulated states, national insurance companies tend to raise rates in states with weaker rules. 
Oklahoma homeowners are effectively subsidizing homeowners in California and other states that have stricter rules governing insurance premiums.
This is one reason why it’s important for Oklahomans to think carefully when choosing our state’s next insurance commissioner when the post is next up for election in 2026. If Oklahomans are fed up with having higher premiums than the rest of the country, perhaps they should determine whether a candidate will act in the public interest.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
Fire officials say Idaho has ‘greater potential’ for significant wildfire season this summer

“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
 An end of ‘Roadless rule’ protections

The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
In Idaho, there are more than 9.3 million inventoried roadless areas within the national forest system, according to the Forest Service data.
The announcement drew mixed reactions from the Western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the Western Governor’s Association conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “Western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Attorneys who have fought for — and against — Trump on national stage will defend — and oppose — the new law in federal court. 
The post High-profile attorneys flock to lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law has drawn high-powered attorneys from across the country to the case, including several from a firm President Donald Trump hired to keep his name on the 2024 ballot. 
California-based Dhillon Law Group and Colorado’s Gessler Blue are representing Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who the complaint names as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks. 
Set to go into effect on July 1, the law requiring a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, was a key priority of Gray’s and the right flank of the Wyoming Legislature. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. 
Two firms represent the group — Colorado-based civil rights attorneys Killmer Lane as well as Elias Law Group, the country’s leading voting-rights litigators. 
It’s not unusual for the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to contract with outside counsel. In this case, it did so at Gray’s request.  
“The Dhillon Law Group, which was founded by Trump [Department of Justice] Attorney Harmeet Dhillon, as well as Scott Gessler, bring a wealth of knowledge and experience regarding election law and defense of the truth,” Gray told WyoFile in a statement. “They have shown themselves to be strong upholders of conservative values, including election integrity, when they worked with President Trump in the last few years on a variety of legal issues.”

Cheyenne’s Falen Law Offices will also represent Gray, according to court documents. 
The decision by both sides to hire high-powered attorneys raises the case’s profile and may indicate that a lengthy legal battle lies ahead. 
Elias Law Group
Before Marc Elias founded Elias Law Group in 2021, he served as general counsel for John Kerry and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns. And when Trump took to the courts to overturn the 2020 election, Elias prevailed in all but one of 65 related lawsuits. In 2024, Kamala Harris’ campaign hired Elias in anticipation of election certification battles and mass voter challenges that ultimately did not materialize. 
Currently, Elias Law Group is litigating 55 voting and election cases in 24 states, including Wyoming. 
“We are proud to represent the Equality State Policy Center in this critical lawsuit because Wyoming voters deserve free, fair, and secure elections in which all eligible citizen voters are able to freely participate,” Elisabeth Frost with Elias Law Firm wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
“Every time a law like House Bill 156 has been passed it has caused citizen voters to be excluded from the process. Voting rights should not be a partisan issue and we are looking forward to making our case to the court,” Frost wrote. 
Both Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus criticized Elias Law Group’s involvement in the case, with the latter calling the complaint a “meritless lawsuit.”

Dhillon Law Group and Scott Gessler 
While Elias worked against the overturning of the 2020 election, Harmeet Dhillon, a legal advisor to the Trump campaign, aimed to get the case in front of the country’s highest court. 
“We’re waiting for the United States Supreme Court — of which the president has nominated three justices — to step in and do something,” Dhillon told Fox Business at the time.
About 14 years prior, she founded Dhillon Law Group in San Francisco. During the pandemic, the firm sued California on behalf of those opposing stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. The firm also challenged the state’s switch to a mail-ballot election. 
In the last presidential election, Dhillon represented Trump against state-level efforts to remove him from the ballot for his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. 
That included a case in Colorado in which Dhillion worked alongside attorney and former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler. 
“Democrats are conspiring to commit the biggest election interference fraud in world history, right before our eyes, as government officials avert their eyes to the mockery of the constitution and our laws,” Dhillon posted on X at the time. “This is a low point in American history.”

Gray also weighed in on the case, joining two other Republican secretaries of state in filing an amicus brief opposing a court’s decision to disqualify Trump from appearing on the ballot. 
Late last year, Trump appointed Dhillon to serve as the assistant attorney general leading the Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Department of Justice. Dhillon subsequently left the firm for the position. 
The case’s current status
As part of its legal challenge, attorneys for Equality State Policy Center filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
On June 10, Gray’s attorneys asked the court for a three-week extension to file a response and to reconsider its decision not to hold a hearing. 
“It is reasonable to assume that the plaintiff has spent considerable time — well in advance of filing its complaint — to compile this evidence,” Gray’s attorneys wrote, referring to more than 500 pages of evidence ESPC provided to the court. 
“It would be unfair to limit defendant Gray to substantially less than two weeks to develop evidence to contest plaintiff’s claims. Defendant Gray anticipates that he will need to present the oral testimony of two to four witnesses, who will explain how Wyoming will implement the new law, thus enabling the court to fully understand the law’s implementation and effect on voters statewide.”
ESPC opposed Gray’s extension request, arguing that Gray’s public comments demonstrate that he “has been fully aware of this lawsuit and the preliminary injunction motion since they were filed.”
Ultimately, the court granted a partial extension to Gray, kept with its decision not to hold a hearing and highlighted an interview with the secretary. 
“To be sure, outside counsel’s assertion that they need additional time to prepare a defense to the preliminary-injunction request is certainly undercut by defendant Gray’s public statements on May 27, 2025 that he was then in the process of working with outside counsel ‘on preparing that vigorous defense on the preliminary injunction,’” U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl wrote.
Gray has until Friday to file a response.

State shouldn’t have to rely on courts to salvage Legislature’s incompetent funding of public schools, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming’s ‘universal’ school vouchers are a sinking ship appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s school voucher program makes me think of the Titanic. Like a hastily built luxury liner that sinks to the bottom of the ocean, the program that uses public money on private education is going down, hopefully never to resurface.

Opinion

I’ve got about 3,818 other analogies — coincidentally the number of student applications the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act had received by last week — but I think the stark imagery above should show you that I think the state’s latest “universal school choice” gambit is destined to be a colossal failure that won’t survive. The courts will take it down.
And the legislators who gave us this mess will scream, even though it’s 100% their fault.
The Wyoming Education Association and nine parents of K-12 students recently sued the state to throw out this abomination that was created by the far right to end public education as we know it. 
The $7,000 in school vouchers the program provides parents annually to send their kiddos to private or parochial schools is inherently unconstitutional, and lawmakers knew that but proceeded anyway, wasting time and public resources.
I can’t imagine any court in the state, including the Wyoming Supreme Court, where this will eventually land, could look at the Wyoming Constitution and do anything but reject the voucher program.
“Nor shall any portion of any public school fund ever be used to support or assist any private school, or any school, academy, seminary, college or other institution of learning controlled by any church or sectarian organization or religious denomination whatsoever,” Article 7, Section 8 reads.
It doesn’t take a legal scholar like Madeline Matlock, Perry Mason or even Judge Judy to understand this constitutional prohibition on public funding of private schools. What Wyoming’s founders wanted is written in plain English; the issue is black and white.
But like a classic disaster movie with a tragic ending, the main characters knew school vouchers were unconstitutional and plowed ahead anyway.
To play devil’s advocate, let’s say the state has an “out” in other constitutional language that allows the spending of public funds only for the necessary support of the poor. That’s how the Legislature in 2024 tried to justify passage of its first school voucher program, “Educational Savings Accounts.”
Lawmakers set income guidelines for families to qualify for up to $6,000 per child per year to pay for private tuition or other expenses. It was a weak argument because the constitution doesn’t say there could be an educational exception to help the poor. The WEA’s lawsuit calls it an example of “gratuitously funneling public funds to private individuals and entities, regardless of whether they are poor and regardless of whether that support is necessary.” 
The 2025 bill to expand the ESA program passed despite objections from moderate Republicans who said the state would spend time and tons of money in court to defend it.
The Freedom Caucus stomped its feet to protest any income limits, damn the costs, because other red states demanded “universal” school choice and got it. The caucus claimed those successes proved Wyoming’s version would stand up in court, neglecting the real-life repercussions of such programs. Arizona, for example, spent $332 million on its expanded universal voucher system last year, while facing a $1.3 billion state budget deficit.
What I find really rich about Wyoming’s far-right reaction to the WEA and parents’ lawsuit is summed up by Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder’s complaints.
In a statement to WyoFile, Degenfelder decried the education association’s “left-wing lawfare” and called the timing of the lawsuit “deeply” troubling.
“To wait until two weeks before the [ESA] funds are to begin distribution to ask for an injunction is devastating to the nearly 4,000 Wyoming families that have signed up for the program and the many service providers that are counting on those families,” Degenfelder said. “This is reckless and our Wyoming children are the collateral damage.”
No, what’s reckless and troubling — and should be clear to voters — is that despite the WEA and other opponents repeatedly pointing out the unconstitutionality of such bills for several years, the Freedom Caucus and state officials like Degenfelder paid absolutely no attention. They stumbled toward their goal of universal school choice, spiking the ball in victory before reaching the end zone (i.e., not developing a clear legal strategy to defend an unconstitutional law in court).
The Legislature should look at the outcome of all the lawsuits filed over its long history of education funding and realize what we all know: It sucks at this. 
In a series of landmark rulings dating back to the 1980s, the Wyoming Supreme Court has always found the state hasn’t followed the constitutional mandate to fund a public K-12 system that provides a high-quality and equitable education for all students. The constitution’s education clause states, “The Legislature shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.”
The most recent lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s school funding formula was filed three years ago by the WEA and eight school districts, who maintained the state has withheld appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security.
On Feb. 26, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula that he wrote negatively impacted children’s right to a proper education. The next day, the House and Senate reached a compromise despite some major disagreements and passed the school voucher bill.
The Legislature, in my view, effectively told the courts, “You think how we fund public schools is so bad? Wait until you see the damage we can do with our new school voucher program.”
While simultaneously defending this unconstitutional program in court, the state will be following the rigorous “recalibration” process the courts have ordered it to use every five years to reset its school funding formula. If you’ve never had the soul-crushing experience of spending countless hours at these public hearings, let me explain what “recalibration” does. 
The state hires independent consultants for a considerable amount of money to detail what should be in the “basket of goods” — what public schools offer students — and how much to spend. The consultants develop a well-reasoned and legally defensible model that is higher than the state currently spends.
The Legislature’s Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration hears the consultants’ recommendations, thanks them for their service, and chucks the whole report. Then, lawmakers draft a bill that cuts education funding while passing measures like the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act that leave even less funds on the table for public schools.
Like the incompetent builders of leaky boats, the architects of the school voucher bill knew what was coming. This is on them, but we’ll all pay for it.

Casting doubt on a system without evidence erodes confidence in vaccines that have protected generations of children from disease, five Wyoming doctors write.
The post Wyoming pediatricians: Restoring trust begins with facts, not fear appeared first on WyoFile .","Vaccines are one of the most successful public health tools in human history. In Wyoming and across the nation, they have prevented countless hospitalizations, permanent disabilities and early deaths. As pediatricians, we see firsthand every day how vaccination protects children and their families. That’s why we are deeply concerned by recent developments at the federal level that risk undermining public trust in this life-saving work. 

Opinion

Recently, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the mass dismissal of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the independent panel of scientists and clinicians that reviews vaccine safety and makes recommendations. His rationale centered on vague claims that the committee has failed to exercise proper oversight due to alleged conflicts of interest.
Let us be clear: Questioning science is healthy. But discarding experts and casting suspicion on decades of transparent, peer-reviewed work — without providing meaningful evidence of wrongdoing — does not rebuild trust. It erodes it.
The facts tell a very different story.
ACIP’s meetings are open to the public, webcast live, and archived online with detailed agendas and minutes available for anyone to review. Anyone can attend, watch or submit public comment. 
Meeting materials and livestreams are available at https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings.
When Secretary Kennedy criticizes ACIP for “never rejecting a vaccine,” he overlooks the committee’s actual role. The panel only reviews vaccines after the FDA has completed its rigorous approval process. Its recommendations focus on whether the vaccine should be added to the U.S. immunization schedule based on safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and population health impact. If a safety signal emerges post-approval — as happened with the Rotashield vaccine in the late 1990s — ACIP will update or withdraw recommendations accordingly. That’s not rubber-stamping; that’s scientific vigilance in action.
Concerns about conflict of interest have been raised in the past — most notably in a 2000 congressional report and 2009 Inspector General review. In response, reforms were implemented: ACIP members must now publicly disclose financial interests, complete annual ethics training and recuse themselves from discussions involving potential conflicts. The CDC posts each member’s financial disclosure on its website and assigns ethics officials to review them. These processes are not just guidelines — they are legal and structural safeguards designed to preserve integrity.
Do we believe these systems can be continually improved? Absolutely. But we also believe in defending institutions that, when operating transparently and with integrity, serve the public good.
Casting doubt without evidence does not reform — it destabilizes.
The current ACIP vaccination schedule is the product of decades of rigorous scientific research and real-world evidence. It is carefully designed to protect children and communities from serious, potentially life-threatening diseases at the ages when they are most vulnerable. Each vaccine on the schedule has undergone extensive safety testing and continuous monitoring, and the schedule itself is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the best available data. The result is one of the safest and most effective public health tools we have, responsible for saving millions of lives and dramatically reducing rates of once-common childhood illnesses.
Wyoming families know the stakes. We continue to see measles and pertussis outbreaks resurface where vaccine rates fall. As pediatricians, we’ve cared for infants too young to be vaccinated, relying on the immunity of their community to protect them. We’ve seen firsthand the protection that vaccines offer to Wyoming families and children and the consequences when that protection is missed.
This isn’t about politics. It’s about protecting kids, preserving science-based medicine and continuing to earn the trust of families through humility, transparency and fact.
We empathize with parents and guardians who feel torn between competing messages in our modern media landscape. Wyoming’s pediatricians will always listen. We will always answer your questions. And we will always stand up for the tools that keep our children safe.

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

She is a licensed master’s-level social worker. (Photo courtesy of CATCH)Stephanie Day, the executive director of CATCH, has worked the better part of two decades trying to solve the problem with homelessness in southwest Idaho.
The Idaho Legislature has its own solution. On July 1, it will become a crime to sleep (in cars or otherwise) on public sidewalks, parks or public property regardless of the availability of emergency shelter beds. Cities that fail to enforce the law are subject to fines. The bill was labeled an “anti-camping” bill. It applies only to the larger cities in the Treasure Valley – Boise, Meridian, Nampa and Caldwell.
Boise housing organization seeks donations for people experiencing homelessness in summer heat

In Day’s view, the bill (Senate Bill 1141) has nothing to do with camping and everything to do with making life tougher for people facing homelessness.
“Camping is supposed to be fun, but we’re talking about people who are living unsheltered,” Day told me. “It’s not fun, and they are not making smores.”
Cassidy Landry of Eagle, who experienced homelessness first-hand in 2019, expressed her thoughts recently in a letter to the bill’s sponsors – Sen. Codi Galloway of Boise and Rep. Bruce Skaug of Nampa.
“It isn’t anti-camping, it’s anti-survival. During the months I spent sleeping in my car, I wasn’t embracing an outdoor lifestyle … I was simply trying to survive,” Landry said in her letter. “Today, I am successfully housed and stable because I had the opportunity to survive during these critical months. Passing SB1141 takes away that chance of survival and eventual success.”
The effective date for the new law couldn’t come at a worse time, according to Day.
“The summer months are when the most folks are unsheltered. It’s the busiest time of the year for our team,” Day says. “During the cold of winter, friends and family often let those without homes stay with them, but that changes as it warms up.”
Landry has personal experience with summer homelessness – a time when being handed a bottle of water becomes an act of kindness. Last year she wrote a commentary for Idaho Education News, discussing her experience.
“My car, which I once considered a safe haven, transformed into an unbearable oven under the relentless sun,” she wrote. “Sleep was elusive, and each morning I woke up exhausted, drenched in sweat and dreading the day ahead.”
Those hardships, according to Day, don’t always register on society – or the Statehouse politicians.
“A small percentage of the community will ever experience homelessness,” Day says. “On some level, when we drive by people who are living outdoors and are OK with their situation, we are not seeing them as fully human. There’s a feeling that those who are homeless should go to shelters, but there’s not enough space. There are more than 2,600 individuals experiencing homelessness in Ada County, and only 568 shelter beds.”
And, as Cassidy found out, the shelters are not necessarily the most inviting places – which is why she chose to live in her car.
In Day’s world, the law is one more challenge for CATCH to find housing for the homeless. Getting “affordable” housing, with sky-high rentals, is another issue. But CATCH managed to help 114 families last year and has served as a morale lifeline for many others.
Cassidy was one of the success stories. She found her way to Boise after a messy divorce in Houston, Texas, battled through unemployment, drug addiction and spent much of 2019 living in her car. 
Today, she’s living in an apartment in Eagle with her 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter and says that life is good. She has a bachelor’s degree in social science, with an eye toward getting a master’s degree. She is starting a nonprofit that is aimed at providing one-stop shopping for social resources.
“I’m working on building that up, going to school and raising my babies,” she said. She’s also working at “paying it forward” with CATCH, telling her story to anyone willing to listen. 
Homelessness is a complicated matter, but Day says the solution is quite simple, although horribly difficult to pull off.
“We know what to do with the various levels of programming,” she said. “The problem is getting enough people moving in the same direction. It comes down to will and coordination.”

A federal suit seeks to invalidate a new Tennessee law that would make it a felony to “harbor” immigrants without legal status.
The legislation set to take effect July 1, the suit argues, is unconstitutional, infringes on religious freedom and is written vaguely enough to ensnare churches that act as “safe zones” for school children during weather emergencies, landlords whose tenants take in roommates living illegally in the United States and family members living in mixed immigration status homes.
Filed Friday in the Middle District of Tennessee, the lawsuit seeks an immediate injunction to prevent the law from taking effect while litigation plays out in court. It also seeks class action status going forward.
The suit was brought on behalf of the Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, whose Tennessee-based churches provide shelter, sanctuary, English instruction and other services to immigrants regardless of status. 
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

Other plaintiffs include a landlord whose tenant took in roommates without legal status and a father who has legal immigration status but family members in his home who do not.
“This law forces religious organizations to choose between following their values or falling in line. It forces family members — spouses, siblings, even parents — to fear that simply living under the same roof as a loved one without legal status could land them behind bars,” read a statement by Spring Miller of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, which is among a group of organizations providing legal representation. 
“This isn’t just unintended consequences of a bad policy. This is using the law to inflict cruelty and control,” Miller’s statement said.
The law, introduced by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Chris Todd of Madison County, both Republicans, creates a new felony offense for any individual who “intentionally conceals, harbors, or shields from detection” a person known to be residing illegally in the United States for “commercial advantage or private financial gain.” It defines the offense as “human smuggling.” 
The felony carries a punishment of one to six years in prison and a fine of up to $3,000.
At the time the bill was introduced, Taylor said it was designed, in part, to hold non-governmental agencies, or NGOs, accountable for their roles in providing services that keep immigrants without legal status in Tennessee communities. 
Taylor included churches, noting that “even Heaven has an immigration policy.”
“There’s a very specific way you come into heaven to become a resident of heaven,” Taylor said in a February interview with the Lookout once the bill was introduced. “They’ve got a very strict immigration policy, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Americans to have an immigration policy that people follow.”
The legislation drew pushback from clergy and immigrant advocates as it wound through the legislative process.
As written, the legislation defines the term “harbor” as to “provide shelter” but does not define shelter, which “thus purports to criminalize a broad range of innocuous everyday activities providing shelter to immigrants,” the lawsuit alleges.
Tennessee bill to criminalize ‘harboring or hiding” immigrants without legal status advances

Those activities include parents providing housing to an undocumented child who helps pay the bills, a charity that accepts contributions to provide shelter to immigrants without legal status, or churches that rely on donations to give English-as-a-second-language instruction.
Todd, the measure’s cosponsor, said Monday he would be surprised if the legislation would ultimately be found unconstitutional.
“I don’t know how punishing a crime could be unconstitutional,” Todd said. “I mean literally smuggling people, many of which are being smuggled into human trafficking and this just gives law enforcement and our DAs another tool to try to prevent innocent folks from being put into trafficking situations more than anything else.”
Todd also disputed the law could be applied to churches or clergy providing shelter, or individuals housing family members without legal status.
“I don’t know many charities that make money off of hiding people and harboring people,” he said.  “So I just don’t think that’s a thing.”
The lawsuit alleges Tennessee’s law is also a violation of the First Amendment rights of Lutheran Synod churches, pastors, staff and congregations, who provide shelter and other services to immigrants regardless of immigration status as an “expression of their faith.”
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA) in 2015 adopted a commitment to “accompany migrant families today and in the future,” the lawsuit said. The ELCA has “declared that walking alongside immigrants and refugees is a matter of faith” and “a crucial expression of baptismal identity.” 
The suit takes issue with the law’s definition of an unlawful immigrant as based on a determination by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a law enforcement agency that does not, on its own, make determinations of an individual’s immigration status. And it alleges that the state is illegally usurping the authority of the federal government, which alone is charged with immigration enforcement.
Attorneys filing the suit are with the American Immigration Council, Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center
The legislation was among a slate introduced by Tennessee Republican leaders in support of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration during the Tennessee General Assembly’s most recent legislative session.
Republican lawmakers also approved a proposal by Gov. Bill Lee to create a Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division to coordinate with the Trump Administration on immigration enforcement and encourage local authorities to partner with the federal government in enforcing immigration law. A bill that would have allowed public school districts to deny admission to children who could not show proof of lawful immigration status failed to pass after widespread and vocal protests at the State Capitol.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for select Tennessee counties on Friday, opening the door to federal recovery support for individuals and county governments that suffered costly damage from April storms.
The decision comes more than two months after severe storms battered Middle and West Tennessee, bringing destructive tornadoes and once-in-a-generation flooding that killed 10 people and damaged hundreds of homes.
The declaration opens federal funding to individuals in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties. Individual assistance can include temporary housing and home repair grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses and other post-disaster support services. FEMA instructs individuals to file claims with their insurance providers before applying for federal assistance.
A federal cost-share to help cover emergency work, repair and replacement expenses on public property is also available to the state, eligible local governments and some nonprofit organizations. Public assistance is available in 19 counties: Cheatham, Davidson, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Grundy, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Hickman, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Stewart and Tipton.
Federal assistance will cover 75% of eligible recovery costs under the public assistance program, a FEMA spokesperson confirmed Monday. The state and local governments are required to cover the remaining 25%. Historically, Tennessee has split the 25% share evenly with local governments.
Gov. Bill Lee originally requested individual assistance for 15 counties and public assistance for up to 30 counties, in addition to Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding for the state to use toward preventative measures to reduce future risk and harm from natural disasters. Hazard mitigation assistance remains under review. 
Damage to public property and the cost of recovery services is expected to exceed $26 million, according to preliminary assessments conducted by local, state and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials. That estimate does not include individual losses, which can be more difficult to calculate. Tennessee’s emergency management agency estimated around 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits were severely damaged. 
In McNairy County — where an EF-3 tornado with wind speeds up to 160 miles per hour killed five people and devastated swaths of Selmer, the county seat — residents and business owners suffered an estimated $27.6 million in private property damage, according to the county’s emergency management agency. Damage to public property, roads, utilities, and government facilities in McNairy County totaled another $2.7 million, according to preliminary assessments. A joint assessment with help from federal officials found the damages eligible for FEMA’s public assistance program totaled closer to $4 million.
Gov. Lee: Multi-year string of disasters has exhausted state resources
Tennessee is the last state to receive the declaration from the Trump administration following April storms that also ripped through parts of Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.
The president has sole authority to grant a disaster declaration and therefore allow access to FEMA’s assistance programs. After a disaster, local and state governments begin to assess the cost of the damage, sometimes with help from federal personnel. Governors then use these figures to request federal assistance from the president. FEMA uses per-capita cost thresholds to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves and the agency makes recommendations to the president, but meeting those thresholds doesn’t guarantee presidential approval.
Report: Under proposed higher FEMA threshold, recovery would cost TN $468M more from 2008-2024

The administration has indicated that it plans to reduce the amount of federal assistance available to states through FEMA after natural disasters, requiring states to bear more of the financial responsibility for recovery. Trump initially denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration after March tornadoes, but later relented and approved individual and public assistance.
State requests for disaster declarations are on the rise, and over the last 25 years, states in the Lower Mississippi River Basin saw five approvals for every one denial, as compared to a 2-1 approval ratio from 1953 to 1999. Tennessee has received nearly $1.2 billion in federal aid following natural disasters since 1953, according to FEMA data. 
Tennessee has experienced 18 major disaster declarations in the last five years, according to Lee’s letter to the Trump administration requesting federal aid following April’s storms.
The state has managed multiple disasters that have not risen to the level of a presidential disaster declaration on its own, ranging from winter storms in January 2023 to tornadoes and wildfires in 2024 and severe flooding in February 2025 that left much of the small West Tennessee town of Rives underwater, according to Lee’s request.
Recovery continues for 23 major disaster declarations that remain open in Tennessee, including recovery from Tropical Storm Helene. The state allocated $500 million toward Helene recovery efforts.
These efforts have exhausted state resources “to such an extent that they have strained and will continue to impact budgets for current and past calendar years,” Lee’s letter states.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature will test out a method to stream committee hearing videos during the interim between regular sessions this year.
The Executive Committee of the Legislative Council, made up of party leaders in both chambers, voted to approve the pilot program last week.
Committee audio is currently livestreamed on the Legislature’s website. The video pilot program will enable video via fixed cameras in five committee rooms from August until November this year. There are a handful of committees scheduled for that time period, including a meetings of the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission, Legislative Audit Committee and Joint Budget Committee.

After the pilot concludes, legislative leadership will review public feedback of the experience and a report from Legislative Council Staff’s Information Technology department to determine whether it should completely implement the video capability.
It would cost $20,000 to set up and $50,000 annually to maintain the system, according to Zack Wimberly with LCS. He is still determining if the pilot program would have a cost to set up, he said.
Manish Jani, LCS’s deputy director, told lawmakers on Wednesday that the pilot program may not be as comprehensive as a fully-implemented one, and might not cover every scenario in a committee room that could arise during a regular session, such as a lengthy hearing with a long list of witnesses.
“The outlier scenarios may not be factored into the pilot, but it should give us a solid perspective on what the experience would look like,” he said.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Anna Claire Vollers | Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

A government watchdog says it’s unclear when — or even whether — we’ll know going forward how the end of national abortion protections impact Americans’ health outcomes, livelihoods and financial futures as the federal government turns away from abortion data collection indefinitely.
A report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office and first shared exclusively with The 19th analyzed the existing data on the economic impact of abortion bans and found that government tracking has been very limited — and could become more so due to changes made by the Trump administration.
The last federal data on the impact of abortion bans ends in 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned. That data is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been collecting data on the number of abortions and the demographics of those who obtain them in its Abortion Surveillance report for almost six decades.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Since publishing the 2022 data in November (data is typically released on a two-year delay), it’s unclear whether the agency plans to continue the research. Though the CDC’s survey is voluntary and limited in scope — some states, including California, for example, don’t provide information — the report was one of the most reliable sources of government abortion data.
Without it, there is no detailed federal data on what has happened since Roe was overturned. Tuesday marks three years since the landmark Supreme Court case was reversed in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision.
“According to Department of Health and Human Services officials we spoke to in May 2025, the agency, which includes CDC, is undergoing a realignment,” the nonpartisan GAO, which provides independent research for Congress and executive agencies, wrote in its report. “Officials were uncertain whether the resulting changes at the agency would affect future data collection efforts, including data on abortions.”
For its analysis, GAO contacted seven federal agencies to ask what efforts they were undertaking to assess the economic effects of state abortion restrictions. Only the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary said it planned to consider the economic impact of abortion restrictions in some of its upcoming work. The agency uses CDC data to make predictions about birth rates and whether any impact from abortion bans could affect the broader economy and the size of the labor force.
But the agency told GAO it will require three years of abortion data since Roe v. Wade was overturned to be able to come to any conclusion and, even then, the data over that period is so limited it may be too insufficient to be reliable.
All of it hinges on whether the CDC continues to collect state abortion data at all. The CDC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Already, the Trump administration has moved to eliminate research on abortion. In January, Trump issued an executive order blocking data collection measuring the effect of access to reproductive care, including abortion care. The administration scrubbed several references to abortion on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website.
That data could potentially illuminate for lawmakers the myriad effects abortion restrictions can have. Beyond the health consequences, lack of abortion access can destabilize people economically, affecting everything from where they choose to live to whether they can stay employed.
“Not only does the new report show impacts of these harmful bans in stark terms, it also raises red flags about the government’s ability to collect important economic data due to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, in a statement to The 19th. The investigation into the data was requested by Scott and Sen. Richard Blumental, a New York Democrat.
For its report released Monday, GAO had to instead turn to 55 rigorously researched studies conducted over the past seven years, including from the Guttmacher Institute and research published in peer-reviewed medical journals such as JAMA and the American Journal of Public Health. GAO also spoke with four academic researchers and three national organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Blumental called the report “irrefutable” evidence of the impact the Dobbs ruling has on the financial stability of women.
“There’s a proven connection between slashed reproductive freedoms and devastating financial distress. Unsafe and unintended pregnancies have huge costs — in lives and dollars — impacting all of us,” Blumental said in a statement to The 19th. “This fact-based document is a searing indictment of Dobbs on its third anniversary.”
According to the research, getting an abortion has become more expensive since some states banned the procedure, requiring patients to often take time off work to travel to a state with abortion access, plus the cost of that travel, the care itself and any child care expenses. It amounts to a “significant expense for low-income families,” GAO found.
One 2021 study out of Tennessee showed that even the introduction of a mandatory, 48-hour waiting period in 2015 that required two visits to get an abortion caused the average cost to rise by several hundred dollars.
Abortion access also impacts other decisions people make around where to live and whether they get an education. One 2023 study that GAO highlighted found that working women with at least a bachelor’s degree were more than 7 percent more likely to move to a state without restrictions than one with it. Another post-Roe study found that Black women living in states with abortion restrictions as teenagers were less likely than Black women in other states to enter college and complete it.
People who are unable to get an abortion then face worse financial outcomes in the months and years that follow. GAO cites findings from the Turnaway Study, a massive abortion research project that followed 1,000 women over 10 years studying the ways that being denied an abortion reshaped their lives.
Historically, about half of people who seek abortions live in poverty, and economic stability is one of the top reasons they seek an abortion in the first place. Many cite concerns around caring for the children they already have.
The United States’ lacks a strong social safety net for parents — those on food assistance programs can’t use the funds they receive to buy diapers, for instance; mothers on the federal assistance program for low-income women and children are deeply restricted in what formula they can buy with government assistance; and child care across the country is now costlier than in-state tuition in 41 states. For a single parent, child care costs swallow a third of their income on average (and in some states as much as half).
The Turnaway Study found that women who were denied care fell deeper into poverty and took four years to catch up to the employment levels of the women in the study who did receive an abortion. GAO’s analysis of the existing data also found that women who were denied care were less likely to be working full-time six months after the denial.
Diana Greene Foster, the author of the Turnaway Study and a MacArthur “genius grant” recipient, was hoping to continue her work by following people who sought abortions after the overturn of Roe.
But Foster was only six months into a five-year federal grant to fund the study when federal funding was terminated in March.
In a letter from the National Institutes of Health that Foster shared with The 19th at the time, she was told her research no longer aligned with agency priorities: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Scott Louser, R-Minot, talks to a colleague in the House chamber on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota lawmaker says he’ll no longer petition for a ballot measure to make the state fund 100% of the public school system after polling showed homeowners have mixed feelings about his proposal.
Property taxes assessed by local governments cover about 27% of the cost of North Dakota’s public school system for the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Department of Public Instruction. The state paid the other roughly 73%.
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, says the state should cover local governments’ share of public school costs. He believes this is key to broad, long-term property tax relief.
North Dakota Legislature adopts ‘historic’ property tax bill on final day of session

During the 2025 session he sponsored a bill to this end, though it was rejected in favor of another property tax package, House Bill 1176, which provides homeowners with a tax credit of up to $1,600 for tax years 2025 and 2026. The tax credit is expected to eliminate property taxes completely for a subset of homeowners for the next two years.
Louser ultimately voted for House Bill 1176, but announced at the end of the legislative session he planned to revive his proposal through a voter-initiated measure.
He said his policy would be easier to implement, cheaper and provide broader relief to property owners, since it would extend to agricultural and commercial property as opposed to just residential property.
Still, he said he supports House Bill 1176 and will be waiting to see how voters feel about the program.
“I think it deserves an opportunity to be implemented,” he said. 
Louser commissioned a survey this spring to gauge voters’ appetite for his ballot measure, though the results were inconclusive, he said.
About 49% of respondents said they would support his policy over the tax relief program established by House Bill 1176.
“I wanted to see at least a 20 point margin for support for a constitutional amendment,” he said. “It wasn’t close.”
The survey, conducted by Florida-based consulting firm Kaplan Strategies, was completed by roughly 1,000 North Dakotans, 99% of whom identified themselves as homeowners. Louser paid for the survey.
Some of the results were contradictory, which Louser said suggests respondents may not have entirely understood the policies they were being asked about.
The poll indicated many North Dakotans may be concerned about the sustainability of the residential property tax credit program implemented by House Bill 1176. About 67% of the respondents indicated they are “concerned” that the program “could result in fluctuating or reduced relief in the future” since it has to be re-authorized each legislative session.
Lawmakers made property tax relief a major priority for the 2025 legislative session after voters put a measure on the November ballot to eliminate property taxes based on assessed value. The ballot measure failed, though lawmakers said voters may be inclined to revive it if the Legislature didn’t deliver on tax relief in the future.
Former state lawmaker Rick Becker, who chaired the effort behind the failed ballot measure, said last week he doesn’t have any concrete plans to pursue another property tax amendment.
“There’s nothing on the table right now,” he said.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Women Speak Out Virginia is sending 100 people out to knock on 150,000 doors in Richmond and Virginia Beach between now and late July. Their aim: influence voters to elect candidates this fall who oppose a proposed constitutional amendment to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution.
“As the largest pro-life voter contact program in the country, we are known for our impact on elections,” SBA Pro-Life America Virginia state director Marlene Downing said in a statement. “Our doorstep conversations change the minds of persuadable voters and energize pro-life Americans to go to the polls.” (SBA Pro-Life is a partner of Women Speak Out Virginia.)
Abortion and other reproductive health measures don’t always fall along partisan lines. Red, blue and purple states have sent reproductive rights messages in recent years with red states such as Kansas rejecting an amendment to strip residents of abortion rights and Ohio enshrining abortion rights in its constitution. Virginia’s amendment to do similarly has only advanced because of Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates and state Senate. 
It must pass again in the 2026 legislative session. From there, it would appear on statewide ballots for voters to finally approve or reject. But that depends on whether Democrats can retain their control in the House this year — where all 100 seats are up for election. A handful of competitive districts will be paramount to the amendment’s success or defeat — several of which SBA is focusing on this summer.










Our doorstep conversations change the minds of persuadable voters...


– Marlenę Downing, Virginia state director of SBA Pro-Life America


Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said that opponents of the amendment “see this as their last attempt to stop this.”
That’s because amending the state’s constitution — be it adding something or taking something out — is harder to do than passing a single law. But it also means that enshrined protections are unable to be undone within a single legislative session.
In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a federal case that had protected access nationwide, states have sought restrictions and bans or placed protections in their constitutions. Other reproductive health choices like contraception or fertility treatments have been legislated on or challenged in courts. Amid this shifting landscape, Virginia is currently the least-restrictive southern state when it comes to abortion — and it’s seen a surge of out-of-state patients since the fall of Roe. 
This year, Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment will likely feature as a prominent selling point for candidates — whether they’re vowing to defend it or defeat it. 
What current law allows
Current state law allows most abortions up to around 26 weeks of pregnancy and later abortions require three physicians to attest that continuing a pregnancy would threaten the life of the parent or “irremediably impair” their physical or mental well-being. 
Later abortions make up about 1% of abortions, according to data from Kaiser Family Foundation, a health data nonprofit. About 4% of abortions in Virginia occur between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy — this is usually when severe fetal anomalies are more likely to be detected. Most abortions in Virginia happen under 13 weeks. 
A recent Pew Research Center poll noted support for abortion has remained fairly consistent in recent decades, with 62% of Americans surveyed agreeing that it should be legal in all or most cases. 
The amendment, if approved, would largely shore up Virginia’s existing protections for abortions and would remove the three physician thresholds needed for later abortions. 
Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, challenged the motion on the House floor earlier this year, calling it a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions.”  He argued that lowering the doctor threshold to just one doctor removes safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” he said. Supporters of the amendment countered the change is intended to address barriers faced by rural patients.
He also accused Democrats of supporting infanticide with the amendment, and opponents of the state’s current abortion laws have argued the amendment would allow the procedure up to “the moment of birth.”
State and federal law prohibit infanticide and such accusations have been widely debunked by medical experts.
Still, SBA door-knockers are expected to focus on that message as they did in a press release announcing their campaign.
Director Downing asserted that Democrats are “determined to wipe away all limitations on abortion in Virginia” and said that they would repeal Virginia’s parental involvement laws. 
Republicans had sought changes to the amendment that could shore up existing state law regarding parental consent for minors seeking surgeries, including abortion. Democrats rejected the efforts with House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, referencing both existing law and a judicial bypass option some minors can petition for. 
“The law is the law unless the court says it’s not,” she said at the time. 
Vulnerable candidates get Planned Parenthood support
While Herring’s seat is reliably Democratic leaning, Republicans and abortion opponent groups like SBA Pro-Life have their eyes on others. Between Richmond and Virginia Beach, the canvassing efforts will target potential voters with vulnerable Democratic candidates 
Targeted contests include incumbent delegates Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, along with Democrats running in competitive districts near Richmond, Petersburg and Williamsburg.
May Nivar, is challenging Del. David Owen, R-Henrico. He secured his election by a little over 700 votes in 2023. Jessica Anderson and Kimberly Pope Adams face rematches with incumbents Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, and Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, the latter of which won by 53 votes last time. Meanwhile, challenger, Lindsey Dougherty will challenge Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Colonial Heights as well.
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia plans to support the Democratic candidates through door knocking and other campaign events throughout the rest of the year. Democrats can also expect support from ReproRising Virginia, whose executive director calls “reproductive freedom” a “winning issue.”
“Our organization will be doing everything we can to elect champions statewide, but especially to the House of Delegates,” Lockhart, of Planned Parenthood, said. “We’re confident that when voters have the ability to vote on protecting their rights, they will resoundingly do so.”

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.










These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.


– Sheila Dessau-Ivey of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

The storm claimed three lives, making it the deadliest tornado to hit North Dakota since 1978.

While North Dakota sees an average of about 23 tornadoes a year, fatalities are rare, National Weather Service data indicates. The last tornado to claim three or more lives in the state was a July 4, 1978, storm that killed five people in Elgin. It was recorded as an F4.
Between the 1978 tornado and last weekend’s storm, North Dakota recorded four fatal tornadoes: an F2 in Renville County in 1997, an EF4 in Northwood in 2007, an EF3 in Ward County in 2010 and an EF2 in Watford City in 2018. Each of them resulted in one fatality.
Storm impact on North Dakota agriculture ‘tremendous,’ ag commissioner says

The deadliest North Dakota tornado on record took place June 20, 1957, in Fargo, an F5 that claimed 10 lives.
While the National Weather Service has yet to officially classify this weekend’s tornadoes, preliminary results suggest the storm that hit Enderlin was an EF3, according to Jacob Spender, a meteorologist for the agency’s Grand Forks Office.
The people who died in the Enderlin tornado late Friday were identified as Michael Dehn, 73, Katherine Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Lucio, 89, according to the Cass County Sheriff’s Office.
A separate tornado that appeared south of Valley City has been preliminarily classified as a EF2, Spender said.
The Grand Forks office said Monday it has yet to determine how many tornadoes in total there were.
“We sent a flurry of different teams out to kind of assess the different damage across the area,” Spender said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong is expected to tour the damage this week.

By early 2027, a full statue will grace the entrance to the building. (Photo: Tennessee Arts Commission)Tennessee is planning to install a bronze statue of legendary frontiersman David Crockett by fall 2026 in front of the State Capitol.
The estimated $1 million project is going through the design phase, then will face a state committee evaluation before being erected late next year, in time for the inauguration of the state’s next governor in early 2027, according to state Architect Ann McGauran. She updated the State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee on the schedule Monday.
The Tennessee Capitol Commission previously approved the Crockett statue project after the Edward Carmack statue in front of the Capitol along Martin Luther King Boulevard was toppled during 2020 protests that roiled the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
The statue of Carmack, who died in a 1908 shootout with political rivals, was put up in 1927. The former U.S. senator and newspaper executive who clashed with civil rights activist Ida B. Wells over his support for lynching, was considered a martyr for the prohibition movement at the time.
A bust of Crockett already sits on the second floor of the State Capitol, signifying his importance in the history of Tennessee, where he was born in the eastern part of the state and gained a reputation as a hunter, fighter and story teller before serving in the state legislature and Congress.
Crockett joined the Texas fight for independence from Mexico and died at the Alamo in 1836.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

A new report from researchers at the national Commonwealth Fund finds that North Carolina has made enormous strides in assuring that people receive the right health care at the right time and are able to avoid hospital stays and emergency room visits by receiving timely care.
The percentage of North Carolina adults who reported that there was a time in the previous year that they didn’t go to the doctor when they needed to because they couldn’t afford it dropped by almost half between 2013 and 2023.
The main reasons for the progress – enactment of the federal Affordable Care Act and other improvements to the Medicaid insurance program.
Unfortunately, the report also notes that much, if not all, of this progress is placed in jeopardy by the Republican mega-bill making its way through Congress that would slash Medicaid funding and enact new and bureaucratic work requirements.
The bottom line: Now is the time to build on past success in improving health care access, not backtrack. Senators Tills and Budd should oppose the proposed cuts.

(Photo by Stringer/Getty Images)With the U.S. bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran, relations between the two countries have arguably reached one of the lowest points in modern times. But the bad blood between the two countries isn’t new: The U.S. and Iran have been in conflict for decades – at least since the U.S. helped overthrow a democracy-minded prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, in August 1953. The U.S. then supported the long, repressive reign of the Shah of Iran, whose security services brutalized Iranian citizens for decades.
The two countries have been particularly hostile to each other since Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979, resulting in economic sanctions and the severing of formal diplomatic relations between the nations.

Since 1984, the U.S. State Department has listed Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” alleging the Iranian government provides terrorists with training, money and weapons.
Some of the major events in U.S.-Iran relations highlight the differences between the nations’ views, but others arguably presented real opportunities for reconciliation.
 1953: US overthrows Mossadegh

In 1951, the Iranian Parliament chose a new prime minister, Mossadegh, who then led lawmakers to vote in favor of taking over the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, expelling the company’s British owners and saying theywanted to turn oil profits into investments in the Iranian people. The U.S. feared disruption in the global oil supply and worried about Iran falling prey to Soviet influence. The British feared the loss of cheap Iranian oil.
President Dwight Eisenhower decided it was best for the U.S. and the U.K. to get rid of Mossadegh. Operation Ajax, a joint CIA-British operation, convinced the Shah of Iran, the country’s monarch, to dismiss Mossadegh and drive him from office by force. Mossadegh was replaced by a much more Western-friendly prime minister, handpicked by the CIA.

 1979: Revolutionaries oust the shah, take hostages

After more than 25 years of relative stability in U.S.-Iran relations, the Iranian public had grown unhappy with the social and economic conditions that developed under the dictatorial rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Pahlavi enriched himself and used American aid to fund the military while many Iranians lived in poverty. Dissent was often violently quashed by SAVAK, the shah’s security service. In January 1979, the shah left Iran, ostensibly to seek cancer treatment. Two weeks later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile in Iraq and led a drive to abolish the monarchy and proclaim an Islamic government.

In October 1979, President Jimmy Carter agreed to allow the shah to come to the U.S. to seek advanced medical treatment. Outraged Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, taking 52 Americans hostage. That convinced Carter to sever U.S. diplomatic relations with Iran on April 7, 1980.
Two weeks later, the U.S. military launched a mission to rescue the hostages, but it failed, with aircraft crashes killing eight U.S. servicemembers.
The shah died in Egypt in July 1980, but the hostages weren’t released until Jan. 20, 1981, after 444 days of captivity.

 1980-1988: U.S. tacitly sides with Iraq

In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, an escalation of the two countries’ regional rivalry and religious differences: Iraq was governed by Sunni Muslims but had a Shia Muslim majority population; Iran was led and populated mostly by Shiites.
The U.S. was concerned that the conflict would limit the flow of Middle Eastern oil and wanted to ensure the conflict didn’t affect its close ally, Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in his fight against the anti-American Iranian regime. As a result, the U.S. mostly turned a blind eye toward Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against Iran.
U.S. officials moderated their usual opposition to those illegal and inhumane weapons because the U.S. State Department did not “wish to play into Iran’s hands by fueling its propaganda against Iraq.” In 1988, the war ended in a stalemate. More than 500,000 military and 100,000 civilians died.
 1981-1986: US secretly sells weapons to Iran

The U.S. imposed an arms embargo after Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. That left the Iranian military, in the middle of its war with Iraq, desperate for weapons and aircraft and vehicle parts to keep fighting.
The Reagan administration decided that the embargo would likely push Iran to seek support from the Soviet Union, the U.S.’s Cold War rival. Rather than formally end the embargo, U.S. officials agreed to secretly sell weapons to Iran starting in 1981.
The last shipment, of anti-tank missiles, was in October 1986. In November 1986, a Lebanese magazine exposed the deal. That revelation sparked the Iran-Contra scandal in the U.S., with Reagan’s officials found to have collected money from Iran for the weapons and illegally sent those funds to anti-socialist rebels – the Contras – in Nicaragua.

 1988: U.S. Navy shoots down Iran Air flight 655

On the morning of July 8, 1988, the USS Vincennes, a guided missile cruiser patrolling in the international waters of the Persian Gulf, entered Iranian territorial waters while in a skirmish with Iranian gunboats.
Either during or just after that exchange of gunfire, the Vincennes crew mistook a passing civilian Airbus passenger jet for an Iranian F-14 fighter. They shot it down, killing all 290 people aboard.
The U.S. called it a “tragic and regrettable accident,” but Iran believed the plane’s downing was intentional. In 1996, the U.S. agreed to pay US$131.8 million in compensation to Iran.
 1997-1998: The U.S. seeks contact

In August 1997, a moderate reformer, Mohammad Khatami, won Iran’s presidential election.
U.S. President Bill Clinton sensed an opportunity. He sent a message to Tehran through the Swiss ambassador there, proposing direct government-to-government talks.
Shortly thereafter, in early January 1998, Khatami gave an interview to CNN in which he expressed “respect for the great American people,” denounced terrorism and recommended an “exchange of professors, writers, scholars, artists, journalists and tourists” between the United States and Iran.
However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei didn’t agree, so not much came of the mutual overtures as Clinton’s time in office came to an end.
In his 2002 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush characterized Iran, Iraq and North Korea as constituting an “Axis of Evil” supporting terrorism and pursuing weapons of mass destruction, straining relations even further.

 2002: Iran’s nuclear program raises alarm

In August 2002, an exiled rebel group announced that Iran had been secretly working on nuclear weapons at two installations that had not previously been publicly revealed.
That was a violation of the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran had signed, requiring countries to disclose their nuclear-related facilities to international inspectors.
One of those formerly secret locations, Natanz, housed centrifuges for enriching uranium, which could be used in civilian nuclear reactors or enriched further for weapons.
Starting in roughly 2005, U.S. and Israeli government cyberattackers together reportedly targeted the Natanz centrifuges with a custom-made piece of malicious software that became known as Stuxnet.
That effort, which slowed down Iran’s nuclear program was one of many U.S. and international attempts – mostly unsuccessful – to curtail Iran’s progress toward building a nuclear bomb.
 2003: Iran writes to Bush administration

In May 2003, senior Iranian officials quietly contacted the State Department through the Swiss embassy in Iran, seeking “a dialogue ‘in mutual respect,’” addressing four big issues: nuclear weapons, terrorism, Palestinian resistance and stability in Iraq.
Hardliners in the Bush administration weren’t interested in any major reconciliation, though Secretary of State Colin Powell favored dialogue and other officials had met with Iran about al-Qaida.
When Iranian hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president of Iran in 2005, the opportunity died. The following year, Ahmadinejad made his own overture to Washington in an 18-page letter to President Bush. The letter was widely dismissed; a senior State Department official told me in profane terms that it amounted to nothing.

 2015: Iran nuclear deal signed

After a decade of unsuccessful attempts to rein in Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the Obama administration undertook a direct diplomatic approach beginning in 2013.
Two years of secret, direct negotiations initially bilaterally between the U.S. and Iran and later with other nuclear powers culminated in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, often called the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran, the U.S., China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the deal in 2015. It severely limited Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium and mandated that international inspectors monitor and enforce Iran’s compliance with the agreement.
In return, Iran was granted relief from international and U.S. economic sanctions. Though the inspectors regularly certified that Iran was abiding by the agreement’s terms, President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018.
 2020: U.S. drones kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani


On Jan. 3, 2020, an American drone fired a missile that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Analysts considered Soleimani the second most powerful man in Iran, after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
At the time, the Trump administration asserted that Soleimani was directing an imminent attack against U.S. assets in the region, but officials have not provided clear evidence to support that claim.
Iran responded by launching ballistic missiles that hit two American bases in Iraq.
 2023: The Oct. 7 attacks on Israel

Hamas’ brazen attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, provoked a fearsome militarized response from Israel that continues today and served to severely weaken Iran’s proxies in the region, especially Hamas – the perpetrator of the attacks – and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 2025: Trump 2.0 and Iran

Trump saw an opportunity to forge a new nuclear deal with Iran and to pursue other business deals with Tehran. Once inaugurated for his second term, Trump appointed Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor who is the president’s friend, to serve as special envoy for the Middle East and to lead negotiations.
Negotiations for a nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran began in April, but the countries did not reach a deal. They were planning a new round of talks when Israel struck Iran with a series of airstrikes on June 13, forcing the White House to reconsider is position.
On June 22, in the early morning hours, the U.S. chose to act decisively in an attempt to cripple Iran’s nuclear capacity, bombing three nuclear sites and causing what Pentagon officials called “severe damage.” Iran vowed to retaliate.

(NPS/Public domain)Spring came early this year on the mountain slopes near Crested Butte. David Inouye has monitored the blooming of wildflowers there during the last 55 years. This was not a record year, he reported in May, but it was remarkably different from just a few decades ago.
“Thirty years ago, flowering didn’t start until the first week of June,” reported Inouye, who studies the timing of periodic biological events in plants and animals, a discipline called phenology. By late April this year, seven species of wildflowers had blooms on the slopes of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory.
More wildflowers earlier in spring. What’s not to like about that?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Paonia this year, where Inouye lives, Apricot trees flowered in mid-March. Later frosts killed this year’s crop. That, he says, is one harm to earlier spring.
Early springs produced by rising temperatures also have long-term consequences. In 2005, when I first started writing about climate change, I traveled to the outdoor laboratory at Gothic to see an experiment then underway. John Harte, a scientist from Berkeley, had mounted electric heaters over plots to approximate future temperature increases. How would this change vegetation over time? Would sagebrush eventually replace the wildflowers?
The answer is complex but comes down to one word: yes. We can expect more sagebrush and fewer wildflowers on south-facing hillsides at 9,500 feet in elevation. This, Inouye pointed out, will take time. “Almost all the wildflowers here are long-lived perennials, so change doesn’t happen rapidly. Even if they stop making seeds, some of those individual plants will still live for decades,” said Inouye, who lives in Paonia but remains on the faculty of the University of Maryland.
“It takes long-term study to document changes to the high-altitude environment,” he added. “To some degree that longevity provides a buffer to the ongoing climate changes, especially if we can succeed in reversing them in the foreseeable future.”
An early spring was observed far beyond Colorado’s mountain slopes. A U.S. Geological Survey website on June 6 showed a spring leaf index two and three weeks early across broad bands of the United States, including Colorado.
Once again, so what? In most places, people prefer summer to winter. Besides, isn’t this story about earlier spring getting old? One scientist I queried said yet another story about early springs would induce yawns unless I had a new angle, like a spike in electricity demand for air conditioning during April.
Brad Udall delivered a strong rejoinder at a recent Colorado River conference. “Hold on to your seats,” he told his audience at the University of Colorado’s Getches-Wilkinson Center, “because I’m going to make you uncomfortable.”
The world, explained Udall, a water and climate research scientist at the Colorado Water Institute, is on track for warming of 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. “This far exceeds anything agreed to by the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. And frankly, it terrifies scientists.”
Over land, the temperature increase will be even greater than the global average. “That’s a world unlike anything we currently know, and it’s going to challenge us all on every front.”
Nearly all scientists agree that heat-trapping greenhouse gases are responsible for our predicament. Emissions have risen 60% during the last 35 years. “What we’re witnessing is a monumental failure of both capitalism and governance,” he said.
Why sound the climate change siren at a Colorado River conference? Because water availability in the Colorado River Basin is inextricably linked to rising temperatures. Drought can ease. Aridification, the result of rising temperatures, will not.
The seven states who share the river now struggle over how to share this shrinking river. The 1922 compact assumed 20 million acre-feet. Flows this century have averaged about 20% less.
“I’m now convinced that we need to plan for the worst possible climate future, and that’s somewhere around 10 million acre-feet runoff,” said Udall. “But what it also means is taking a hard look at every existing agreement in the river. It either breaks them or substantially modifies them.”
A hopeless situation? Udall warned against despair. “There’s a term called the pessimism aversion trap. It’s the tendency look the other way when confronted with dark realities,” he explained. Don’t go there, he said. “We still control our destiny, even if the solutions seem daunting.”
And finally, his plea: “I plead with you to get serious about figuring out how to reduce the emissions of your organization and even your own personal emissions. I agree that individual actions aren’t going to solve this, but they send a really strong signal to everyone around us.”

For weeks now, Senate and House Republican leaders have publicly stated that they were far from an agreement on a state budget for the new fiscal year that commences next Tuesday, July 1 – particularly with respect to tax policy. And in recent days, it seems the two sides have concluded that they’d just as soon live with the budget that’s already in place as spend the dog days of summer mired in a public stalemate. State law provides that the current budget will continue absent passage of a new one.
The unveiling of what some are calling a “mini-budget” by Senate leaders Monday evening along with the quick passage of a new Hurricane Helene relief package were the latest signals that Republican legislators believe they’ve reached a point of diminishing political returns and are ready to vacate the capital city – perhaps even for the year.
If the legislature really does call it a year, it will mark a notable departure from the pattern of many of the last several years of GOP rule in which sessions have lingered into the fall (and in a few cases, the holiday season) and a return to the pattern that generally prevailed in the late 20th Century in which lawmakers usually wrapped up their sessions in or around the start of the fiscal year.
And it will also mark a sudden end to a session in which accomplishments likely to make a marked improvement in the lives of average North Carolinians have been notably few and far between.
There will undoubtedly be a raft of additional bills passed and sent to the Governor during the session’s waning days and hours, but at this point, it’s hard to identify much that will be worth bragging about when things have wrapped.
Aside from Helene relief and a relative handful of other lower-profile measures, lawmakers have largely avoided the big challenges that confront the state – things like its underfunded and understaffed public schools, state employee shortages in several core state agencies like prisons, mental health facilities and DMV offices, rising health insurance rates for state employees, a chronic lack of affordable housing and a steady rise in homelessness, a large and growing list of unaddressed environmental challenges, a rising tide of gun violence, and a growing risk of significant revenue shortfalls in years to come.
Instead, Republican leaders have devoted significant and wasteful attention to right-wing culture war priorities, like attacking the rights of immigrants and transgender people, promoting public school book bans and censorship, attempting to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state government, further weakening state gun laws, and pulling back from a previously negotiated law that was designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities.
This provocative pattern was on full display last week when Senators chose the Juneteenth holiday, of all days – a date on which even the state House conducted no business at all – to hold a lengthy floor session and multiple busy committee hearings, one of which was headlined by the bill to ban DEI.
How many of the culture war broadsides will actually find their way into state law, however, remains extremely uncertain at this point. Gov. Josh Stein issued the first three vetoes of his administration last week on a pair of bills designed to spur immigrant deportations and another measure that would allow anyone 18 and older to carry a loaded, concealed firearm without a permit, and it remains unclear if Republicans will be able to command the supermajorities they will need in both houses to override them. Only one of the bills – House Bill 318 — is scheduled for an override vote in the House thus far.
If lawmakers do head out of town this week, they will have to arrange to return to Raleigh at some later date to consider any other vetoes Stein might issue after they depart.
And if Stein and his allies manage to figure a way to preserve most or all of the vetoes he ends up issuing, that fact, in combination with the GOP failure to pass a new and comprehensive budget chockful of conservative pet projects and initiatives, will mark a victory of sorts for Democrats and a validation of their electoral success last fall in narrowly breaking the Republican supermajority in the House.

Don’t be shy. Raise those hands. Anybody?
Virginia car tax credit hits dead end before Senate panel

As Virginians, it’s perhaps our most galling duty: paying hundreds of bucks (thousands for folks with bougie rides) to your city, county or town government for the responsibility of owning a depreciating asset you pay through the nose to buy, insure, fuel and maintain.
According to the Tax Foundation, Virginia is among 27 states and the District of Columbia where tangible personal property taxes are assessed. Fourteen states broadly exempt personal property from taxes; 10 allow de minimis exemptions.
Our car tax is a much-reviled but long-lived creature. Both gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, have pledged to tame — if not slay — this dragon if elected governor.
Twenty-eight summers ago, a candidate for governor and his team of advisers identified and harnessed this resentment in arguably the most effective three-word campaign mantra in Virginia history: “NO CAR TAX!”
That was Jim Gilmore, a Republican whose 1997 gubernatorial campaign realized somewhat by accident that the issue was lightning in a bottle during a rally in Roanoke.
“I came off the stage in Roanoke and said, ‘What was that?’” Gilmore said in an interview Monday, describing the crowd’s ovation to his line about ending the hated tax. “The roar was unearthly.”

He and his campaign brain trust — Boyd Marcus, Ray Allen and Steve Horton — knew they were onto something. They had already staked out positions supporting elevated state educational standards and hiring more teachers in addition to lowering taxes. The pledge to 86 the tax, however, stuck like Velcro and dominated the 1997 campaign.
It was so potent that Gilmore’s Democratic opponent that year, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, went from deriding it as a political parlor trick to offering his own scaled-down “me too” car tax reduction plan in the dying days of his campaign.
Gilmore cruised to a 13-percentage point victory and did something unprecedented: led the Republican Party to its first sweep of Virginia’s three statewide executive branch offices. The late John H. Hager of Richmond was elected lieutenant governor and state Sen. Mark L. Earley of Chesapeake was elected attorney general.
Gilmore’s mandate was convincing enough that the General Assembly — with Democrats clinging to tenuous majorities — passed his plan as a full, five-year phaseout of the tax on the first $20,000 of a car’s value beginning with a 12.5% cut in 1998. The state reimbursed local governments for their lost revenues with direct payments from the state’s general fund, collected largely from income and sales taxes.
Things went well for three years, but time, the economy and global events were not on Gilmore’s side, and they validated Beyer’s admonitions. By 2000, an irrationally exuberant economy built on an overheated, nascent online services industry was collapsing on itself, hitting Washington’s tech-heavy Northern Virginia suburbs — the commonwealth’s economic mainstay — particularly hard. It showed up in Virginia’s general tax collections beginning in fiscal year 2001.










The women running for governor both say they’re ready to end Virginia’s car tax, at long last. Whoever wins, she better show up with a convincing political mandate and a lot of really smart advisers. She must be ready to work insane hours and endure ceaseless frustrations and efforts to sabotage this intricate, delicate endeavor.


– Bob Lewis, Virginia Mercury columnist


In the 12-month budget year that began July 1, 2000, and lasted midway through Gilmore’s final year in office, general fund collections fell $253 million (-2%) below the revenue estimate on which state spending was predicated. By fiscal year 2002, the shortfall ballooned to $1.26 billion (-12%) below the forecast, causing alarm across Capitol Square, particularly within the GOP-led Senate Finance Committee where Democrats and Republicans coalesced against Gilmore’s phaseout.
Virginia could no longer afford to play shell games with local and state revenue without endangering core obligations including public education, public health and public safety. In January 2002, Gilmore turned the Executive Mansion over to Democrat Mark Warner. Weeks later, the General Assembly froze car-tax reimbursement at 70%. In 2004, in a tax restructuring package Warner muscled through a balky GOP legislature, Virginia capped its total car tax reimbursement at $950 million annually starting in tax year 2006 and unchanged since.
Two decades later, the issue simmers anew thanks to soaring post-pandemic car valuations that are inflating car tax bills even on older vehicles. The women running for governor both say they’re ready to end Virginia’s car tax, at long last. 
Whoever wins, she better show up with a convincing political mandate and a lot of really smart advisers. She must be ready to work insane hours and endure ceaseless frustrations and efforts to sabotage this intricate, delicate endeavor.
Says who? Says Gilmore, the OG of car tax relief, who hopes the next governor completes what he started.
“Once you get into the technicalities of doing it, it’s extremely difficult because it is not a state tax. It is a local tax. And that is a problem that has to be solved,” he said.
Yes it is, and the rates are all over the place from county to county, city to city, town to town and even special taxing districts within many of those jurisdictions. For instance, an analysis of personal property tax rates for 2023 shows that the median county rate was $3.54 per $100 of assessed value, but rates that year ranged from $9 in Pittsylvania County to 55 cents in Bath County. Toss in the fact that some localities offer waivers for  elderly, low-income and disabled residents and you can see how hard finding an equitable formula for such a crazy quilt of tax policies would be.
Gilmore said experience taught him that the solution is not to nibble around the edges by scaling back the tax on a prescribed range of valuation then repaying localities.
“I’ll tell you now, in the fullness of time, that if I’d had a second term, we would have completely phased it out, but the question is ‘What then?’” he said. “Upon years of reflection … we would then have had to do a genuine tax reform.”
In other words, wipe the personal property tax off the books. That would require broadening other revenue sources such as real estate or local option sales taxes and likely direct appropriations from the General Assembly.
That wouldn’t be cheap. According to the Auditor of Public Accounts’ 2024 “Comparative Report on Local Government Revenues and Expenditures,” the personal property tax generated $3.95 billion for localities during the 12 months that ended last June 30. That is the second largest local revenue source behind real estate taxes which generated $14.2 billion in local revenue in the same span.
If Earle-Sears and Spanberger are serious about their pledge, perhaps they should contact two primary stakeholders: the VML and the Virginia Association of Counties. Joe Flores, VML’s fiscal policy director, said Spanberger’s team recently reached out to his organization about the tax.
“…[R]eplacing a primary revenue source for counties, cities and towns, at a time when there remains uncertainty about the general fund revenue outlook and the federal government is on the verge of shoving costs onto state and local governments, is likely to prove exceedingly difficult,” Flores said.
“It is worrisome that these proposals have gained political momentum in the press with Virginia facing future reductions in Medicaid, SNAP, and other federal grants because of the federal reconciliation bills proposed in each house of Congress,” said Dean Lynch, VaCO’s executive director. “But we welcome future discussions with either candidate on the best ways to supplant local revenues with needed state funding.”
None of this is to discourage you, Winsome and Abigail, from your promise. But first, learn what such a massive political and policy feat requires. Think of it like putting a person on Mars — not something you can knock off in your garage over a weekend.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers are returning Tuesday to decide the fate of nearly 300 bills that are still awaiting funding. 
In total, these bills would cost about $2.5 billion over the next two years. A bill to increase the cost-of-living adjustments for state employee pensions that is not expected to pass accounts for $1.6 billion of that.
After Gov. Janet Mills signed the budget addition into law on Monday, there is about $7 million left in the general fund that can be allocated for these measures, which were placed on the so-called appropriations table because they require funding.
The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which sets the budget, manages this table. The committee on Tuesday is scheduled to “run the table,” which involves deciding which proposals to fund with the remaining unappropriated money and at what amount. Any bills that the committee decides to leave on the table will die. 
Last year, less than 10% of bills placed on the appropriations table ultimately became law. 
Among the proposals currently on the table are two bills related to firearm regulation. 
LD 1126, as passed in amended form, would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer. It would also prohibit undetectable firearms, meaning those that can’t be spotted with a metal detector. LD 1867 would prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases. 
Two other bills on the table seek to ensure the already required teachings of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively taught in Maine schools. Another bill awaiting funding is a bipartisan compromise to establish a task force to suggest reforms to the real estate property tax. 
A few of the bills on the table have already been incorporated into the budget that Mills signed into law on Monday, including an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government and an act to add certain mental health workers under the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement. These measures will likely remain “on the table” upon adjournment because they’ve been funded an alternative way. 
Any bills the appropriations committee decides to vote off the table will still need approval again by the full Legislature, which is slated to reconvene on Wednesday. 
As lawmakers begin to make these final decisions, use the searchable table below to see all of the bills currently on the table:

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)With no new state budget in sight, a key Senate committee approved a bill Monday evening authorizing new spending in select areas across state government after June 30.
Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), a chief budget writer, said the rewrite of House Bill 125 is not a “mini-budget,” but is a “needs to” bill intended to accomplish goals such as keeping capital projects going and covering increased community college enrollment.
The House and Senate passed different GOP-written budget proposals this session and have been unable to bridge their significant differences. With the state fiscal year ending June 30, legislators plan to begin a long break from General Assembly work at the end of the week and allow the state head into the next fiscal year without a new comprehensive budget.
State law allows spending to continue at current levels even without a new budget, so government will continue running when the next budget year begins July 1. The bill the Senate budget committee approved Monday afternoon includes money for new items for the next two years.
“We have had conversations with House leadership” about the bill, Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Monday night.
The bill will go to the House after the Senate passes it. Berger said that Thursday will likely be the last day of work before legislators take their break.
One of the biggest chunks of money in the bill is $252 million in economic development funds for the JetZero project in Guilford County. The start-up plane manufacturer announced earlier this month that it will invest $4.7 billion in a Piedmont Triad International Airport facility and create 14,560 jobs by 2063. 
The bill provides $30 million for the Healthy Opportunities Pilot to continue for another year. The state Department of Health and Human Services has been pushing hard to have this project continue past June 30. DHHS launched Healthy Opportunities in three mostly rural regions of the state in 2022. It aims to lower health care costs and improve the health of Medicaid enrollees by helping them secure food, transportation, and housing, and help those experiencing interpersonal violence. 
The bill funds enrollment growth at K-12 public schools and the UNC system, as well for community colleges. 
The bill includes $700,000 for the Environmental Management Commission to hire its own staff. 
State Auditor Dave Boliek would receive $6 million a year for two years to pay for 45 positions in the new Division of Accountability, Value, and Efficiency. The division would recommend cuts to government offices or jobs, NC Newsline reported.
The bill would allow spending of $4.1 million over two years to hire a total of 61 driver’s license examiners at the DMV.
In the appropriations committee, Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) noted the current 68% job vacancy rate at the DMV and questioned whether the problem is not having enough positions. 
Sen. Mike Lee (R-New Hanover), said he’s been in touch with Paul Tine, the new DMV commissioner. 
“I’ll be honest with you, I don’t have all the answers on how to fix the DMV,” said Lee, a budget committee chairman. “I don’t know if anyone does. The request was for additional positions, so that’s what this does.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_8592-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:58:19.819563

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Screenshot/Arkansas Legislature)Arkansas lawmakers on Monday questioned the head of State Police’s Crimes Against Children Division about the process for deciding which reports to the Child Abuse Hotline to investigate.
The hotline accepted 9,042 of the 16,480 reports it received from Jan. 1 to March 31 of this year, according to a quarterly report CACD commander Maj. Jeffrey Drew presented to the Legislature’s Joint Children and Youth Committee. 
The Crimes Against Children Division took on 1,593 of those reports while the Department of Human Services’ Division of Children and Family Services took on the other 7,449.
Law enforcement takes multiple allegations against the same person into account when deciding whether to investigate a report of child maltreatment, Drew said in response to questions from Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, and committee co-chair Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett.
“If we have a call that comes in on Person A again, and we look at that history and say, ‘We’ve got some stuff going on here,’ maybe we need to go ahead and accept this one and at least get an investigator out to take care of it, instead of it ending there at the hotline,” Drew said.
Wardlaw asked Drew and DCFS Director Tiffany Wright how many reports per county the hotline did not accept. Wright said she would provide the committee later with the requested data on “screened out” reports.
Wardlaw said he had hoped the data was already available, and he added that he was frustrated by an instance in his South Arkansas district in which a report of child maltreatment was “screened out” that should not have been.
He told Wright during a meeting of the same joint committee last month that he was disappointed in the apparent shortage of foster care caseworkers in his home of Bradley County, calling it a “neglect” of his constituency.
Staffing struggles continue for Arkansas foster care system

 
Many reports to the child abuse hotline result in foster care cases, and the Division of Child and Family Services has consistently reported to lawmakers that its foster care management system is short-staffed.
The hotline received 57,854 calls between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, of which 24,244 were accepted for investigation, according to a DCFS report Wright presented Monday — 5,185 of those investigations found the reports to be true, and 408 appeals led to 82 investigations being overturned, the report states.
The Children and Youth Committee also heard an annual report Monday from the state’s Infant and Child Death Review (ICDR) Program at Arkansas Children’s Hospital that said more than half of the deaths from unnatural causes among Arkansas children in 2022 were deemed accidental.
The review committee’s reports are by law roughly two years behind. For example, the panel reviewed 2022 deaths between July 2023 and October 2024, according to its report.
The state child death advisory panel reviewed the causes and circumstances of 172 of the 453 deaths among Arkansans under 18 years old in 2022, panelists told the Joint Children and Youth Committee while presenting the program’s annual report.
The remaining 281 child deaths were either under investigation by law enforcement or determined to be of natural causes during the period of review, said Kevin Cleghorn, president of the Arkansas Coroners’ Association and a member of the ICDR panel.
Of the 172 unnatural deaths, the panel recorded 87 as accidental, 13 as suicides and nine as homicides, with the causes of all three kinds of deaths including drowning, firearms, overdoses and asphyxia, according to the report.
Twenty-six of the accidental deaths were caused by motor vehicles.
“Children aged 10-17 accounted for the majority of these deaths, and were most often driving the vehicle,” the report states. “Safety restraints, including seatbelts, boosters and car seats, were not used in more than half of the cases.”

EXHIBIT E - ICDR FY25 Annual Report 
The review panel’s report labeled the remaining 63 child deaths undetermined, including 54 infants who died of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID).
“Of these, 66% died co-sleeping in an adult bed with one or more adult (an increase from 47% the previous year), and 54% were placed on their side or stomach to sleep,” the report states. 
The panel issued a list of recommendations to reduce child deaths, many of which involved bolstering parents’ education and resources, such as safe sleep practices to prevent SUID and free or low-cost swimming lessons to prevent drowning.
Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, said the most concerning statistic in the report was the near-doubling of Arkansas children who accidentally drowned, from 11 in 2021 to 19 in 2022. She said she plans to “work and see what we can do with a public-private partnership” to ensure children learn to swim.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire lawmakers are moving ahead on a slew of bills to tighten voting procedures, with Republicans arguing that stricter processes are necessary for election security.
After a series of negotiations between the House and Senate last week, Republicans in both bodies are pushing forward bills to require more documentation for absentee voters and to mandate annual reviews of the voter checklists, rather than the current once-a-decade reviews. 
The bills are not guaranteed to pass; they must all clear final votes in the House and Senate on Thursday before they can head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. 
But they continue a multi-year effort by Republicans to add new verification processes to voting that supporters say is important for election integrity but that critics say create high hurdles.
Here’s a look at what’s moving ahead.
A once-a-year voter review
Currently, municipal election officials known as “supervisors of the checklist” are required to maintain a list of registered voters for each town or polling ward — lists that determine whether someone is eligible to vote there. 
Every year, as supervisors receive death certificates, moving notices, or other new information, they must adjust the rolls to remove those voters.
But once a decade, in the year ending in “1,” such as 2011 and 2021, the supervisors undertake a more comprehensive review. They look at every voter on the list; if the voter has not voted in an election within the last four years, and the town or city has no other information, they must send out letters to that resident’s address to verify that they still live there. Those who do not respond or are found ineligible are removed from the list and must re-register.
Senate Bill 221, as amended by House and Senate negotiators last week, would require that comprehensive process to be held annually, rather than once a decade.
The final version of the bill echoes an earlier bill, House Bill 274, which the Senate voted down in May. 
House Republican supporters say the 10-year process is not sufficient to keep the voter rolls up to date, noting that nearly 250,000 voters were taken off the rolls in the latest 2021 voter roll review. 
“This verification looks to remove voters who have not voted in a number of elections or have moved but did not inform the state or have died,” said Rep. Robert Wherry, speaking on HB 274. 
Supporters say an annual process would make the rolls more dependable, and that the continual update would reduce the workload for election officials in any one year.
But the New Hampshire Municipal Association is opposed to the bill, arguing it will create too high a workload for supervisors of the checklist, who are elected to seven-year terms but are volunteers. 
“We understand, OK, the 10 years seemingly being too long, but we think one year is going to be too short of a period — too short of a turnover every time,” said Sarah Burke Cohen, a legislative advocate for the association, in an interview. 
Burke Cohen said the once-a-decade period is already exhausting for many supervisors, and that the annual requirement could make it hard to attract people to run for the position.
Olivia Zink, executive director of Open Democracy, also warned that the annual comprehensive reviews could create headaches for voters who are mistakenly removed. 
“You could have a supervisor of the checklist … that just took somebody off the list that shouldn’t have been removed, and then the burden is now on the voter to register to vote,” she said.
The new bill addresses that concern by increasing the “grace period” in the law — the period before the review in which a voter must have voted in at least one election in order to stay on the rolls — from four years to five years. That change means if a review were carried out in 2025 and a voter had last voted in the 2020 election, the voter could stay on. 
The newly amended SB 221 requires the Secretary of State’s Office to create “any forms necessary” to allow that re-registration; some supporters say that that form could allow for a streamlined process for voters who were wrongly purged to restore their registration. 
And under the bill, a voter could be removed from the rolls only if town election officials had given them warning. The bill requires the supervisor of the checklist of the voter’s last known address to send a notice to that address at least 30 days before the election to tell the voter to re-register.
Susan Moore, a supervisor of the checklist in Franconia, which has around 800 voters, says the annual review would not pose a major burden for a small town such as hers.
“If we were in one of the cities like Concord or Manchester or Bedford or Nashua, it’s a whole lot more work, because they have a lot more happening,” she said in an interview. 
Absentee ballot requirements move forward
House and Senate Republicans came to agreements last week on a number of other bills that would tighten the voting process.
Committee of conference representatives agreed to the House’s version of Senate Bill 287, which would require people interested in voting absentee to either show up to town offices in person or to mail a notarized application.
And negotiators are moving forward with the House’s version of Senate Bill 218, which would mandate that those same people provide documentary proof of their citizenship when mailing in an absentee ballot, and to do so with a witness’s signature. 
And the two chambers agreed to the Senate’s version of House Bill 67, which would require that all cities, towns, and school districts have at least one accessible voting machine available during local elections, and that they enter into an agreement with the Secretary of State’s Office to borrow them. The Secretary of State’s Office already provides those machines in elections with federal candidates, per federal law, but this law would apply to town meetings and municipal elections, too. Under the final version of HB 67, towns and cities would be responsible for the costs to program the machines for local ballots, but not for the machines themselves.
But the chambers also agreed to House Bill 613, which would create a carve-out option for cities and town officials that do not believe they need to provide accessible voting machines. Under that agreement, a municipality may post a notice on its website at least three months before the election that it is not planning to offer the accessible machines unless someone submits a written request that they do so. That written request would need to be received at least 60 days before the election, should the municipality choose to pass the notice.
Disability rights advocates have spoken against HB 613, raising concerns that a person with disabilities could move into such a town within 60 days of an election and would not be able to use an accessible machine. But Sen. James Gray has said small towns in the North Country requested the bill, citing the cost of programming the machines and the potential that no voter would use them.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/votingchecklist-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:58:19.819563
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT loses $20M as Trump cuts digital equity programs,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/ct-digital-equity-broadband-trump/,CT libraries lost out after the federal government changed programs that sought to close inequities in internet access and digital know-how.,"Employees at the Hartford Public Library were overjoyed early this year when they learned they’d be receiving $50,000 to help expand digital literacy and skills in the region.
Staffers immediately got to work on a pilot program, using the money to support a “Community Digital Literacy Pilot” to help residents navigate the internet and use devices like smartphones and laptops. This spring, the library system hired a program manager and three part-time digital navigators — who provide technical assistance with the internet — to hold office hours and teach skills classes in English and Spanish. Posters and flyers were finalized, laptops were purchased, and a marketing campaign was expected to launch in late May.
Library leaders knew they were addressing a significant need — one felt not only in cities like Hartford but in communities across Connecticut. According to state research, while roughly 73% of people in Connecticut have access to internet-capable devices, just 64% have the skills needed to use those devices. Advocates hoped programs like the one planned in Hartford would go a long way in closing that gap. 
Those hopes were dashed in May when President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to announce he was cutting funding for the Digital Equity Act, a Biden-era federal grant program that supported the Hartford library pilot and other projects in states across the country.

The president called the program “illegal,” adding that it was “racist” for seeking to teach digital skills and improve internet access in minority communities. Other vulnerable populations included in the program — rural populations, veterans and low-income households — went unmentioned.
On May 9, one day later, the administration sent a formal letter to every state, officially terminating the $2.75 billion grant program.
Just like that, the money for the Hartford Public Library program was gone.
“We had our toe in the water,” said Bonnie Solberg, the director of public services for Hartford Public Library. “And then the money got pulled.”
In recent weeks, the federal government has made sweeping changes to Biden-era programs that sought to close persistent inequities in internet access and digital knowledge. The changes have put the futures of several federal broadband initiatives in jeopardy, including efforts to expand internet connectivity and make access more affordable.
The Digital Equity Act was cut completely, pulling a vital funding source out of the biggest effort to improve the digital skills of vulnerable communities in American history.
That loss, state and national advocates told The Connecticut Mirror, will not completely end efforts to close digital divides in the state. But it will force a change in strategy, requiring organizations to find new approaches to the problem just as they were closing in on solutions.
“When you constrain the funding, you constrain the timeline and the impact,” said Doug Casey, executive director of the Connecticut Commission for Educational Technology. 
Pulling the plug on $2.75 billion
The Digital Equity Act was passed by Congress in 2021 as part of the larger bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The bill was a key piece of the Biden administration’s policy agenda, and it arrived as the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing the nation into remote work and online classrooms — throwing into stark relief who had internet access and who did not.
Lawmakers directed billions of dollars in federal investment into closing those divides. The $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program was enacted to improve and expand internet connections and access in every state. The smaller $2.75 billion Digital Equity Act, which focused on building the digital literacy skills needed to make the most of those connections, served as a companion.
In Connecticut, where 92% of households have access to the internet, the Digital Equity Act was seen as a big help. “What we found was that regardless of connection, people just didn’t have the skills that they needed to use the technology effectively,” Casey said. “They didn’t feel comfortable online.”
Casey’s office has worked to expand digital access and knowledge in the state for years, and it was the natural choice to lead local digital equity efforts. In early 2024, the commission announced that it had completed a 300-page “digital opportunity” plan outlining the skills gaps in the state, the communities and populations most affected by a lack of digital literacy, and Connecticut’s community-driven proposal to remedy those divides.

The resulting plan, “Connecticut: Everyone Connected,” aimed to take a long-term approach that would tackle a range of interrelated issues. It promoted the creation of pilot programs that would connect state residents directly with teachers and skills classes, and it called for indexing resources and building an asset map to show exactly where those support providers are located in the state. A new digital equity curriculum would make it easier to teach and review standard concepts with residents on a recurring basis.
The policy required states to focus their plans on certain “covered populations” — groups the federal government determined needed special attention: veterans, low-income communities, seniors over the age of 60, people with disabilities, those with low literacy or limited English skills, and racial and ethnic minorities. The largest community was rural populations, defined as anyone who does not live in or near a town with a population of 50,000 or more. 
Connecticut’s digital equity plan was approved by the federal government in March 2024, and the state was waiting to receive the funds. In total, Connecticut was set to receive more than $20 million, a mix of state funding and money for local organizations that won a competitive national grant application process.
“This was a fundamental program to get people online and, more than that, to allow people to participate in the modern world,” said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement for the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a national organization supportive of the digital equity money. “Virtually everything we do, from looking up transportation, using the bus, to accessing courts, to using government 311 services, to finding a job, the whole modern world basically has some online component.” 
“This was a fundamental program to get people online and, more than that, to allow people to participate in the modern world.”Drew Garner, the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society
That significance has not protected the program from federal scrutiny. As of now, the digital equity funds have been pulled back from states before they could ever use them. 
And the Trump administration has altered the larger BEAD program, removing many of its initiatives that supported climate change resilience, workforce diversity and broadband affordability. States must now update and resubmit their proposed broadband plans within the next few weeks, a rapid turnaround after months of initial planning. 
In a statement provided to CT Mirror, a spokesperson for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the federal agency tasked with overseeing both the BEAD program and the Digital Equity Act, defended its changes. 
“Congress created the BEAD program to expand Americans’ access to high-speed internet. More than three years later, the program hasn’t connected a single person to broadband,” an NTIA representative said in an emailed statement. “The changes we’ve announced will help the BEAD program move forward quickly, and any time spent implementing these reforms will be outweighed by the savings in time and money from the increased competition, reduction in regulatory burdens and streamlined permitting.”
The agency declined to respond to questions about the end of the Digital Equity Act. 
An ‘absolutely critical’ lifeline
Digital equity advocates say the loss of the federal funding will be felt all over the state, hampering efforts to help vulnerable communities build the skills needed to succeed in school, in the workforce, and in daily life.

Many of the efforts were already underway. 
The United Way of Connecticut was working on changes to its long-active statewide 211 hotline, which is used to connect people in need with resources like housing shelters, mental health providers and utility assistance. The organization had planned to use some of the federal money to expand its database of digital literacy resources and programming. That information would also help the state create an asset map showing the places where additional investment is needed.
With the federal funding now off the table, the organization says it will need to adjust its plans. 
“There’s nothing that we can do that would replicate those millions of dollars that would go into creating new services,” said Amy Casavina Hall, senior vice president of strategic partnerships, development and communications at the United Way of Connecticut. 
The federal termination will also pull $11.9 million in competitive grant funding from Capital Workforce Partners, a regional workforce development board that was hoping to expand digital access in the state’s north-central region.
“This grant would have provided us with the capacity to serve 5,000 households,” CEO Alex Johnson told reporters at a recent press conference. “It would have given us the capacity to support 18,000 individuals, to give them the skills that they need to be able to maneuver in this society.”

East Hartford resident Elaine Andresen said she knows firsthand the importance of digital equity programs. The retired school teacher has been working with her local library to access the support of a digital navigator to help her use the internet and get connected to online banking. 
“It just is nice to have a service,” Andresen said at a recent press conference, noting that Connecticut’s senior citizens often struggle with digital skills as technology continues to change. “You can have the equipment, and people can help you.” 
The digital navigator who worked with Andresen, Magdelena Holler, has been teaching digital literacy skills in the area since 2021, helping people who walk into East Hartford’s Wickham Memorial Library. She meets regularly with more than a dozen clients, assisting them with everything from accessing a website to signing up for a new email address.
“There’s an assumption that everybody knows [how to use the internet] or that everybody has access, and that is just not true,” Holler, who also works as East Hartford Public Library’s digital inclusion manager, said. “Not everybody has the devices, and not everybody has the knowledge to use those things safely. It’s absolutely critical for folks to be able to do things like sign their kids up to school, check their own health records, cancel and make appointments.” 
With funding gone, CT looks for a way forward
Last week, a group of concerned advocates, local and state officials and community members gathered at the Wickham library, joining U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal in lamenting the loss of the federal money and calling for the Digital Equity Act to be restored.
“We wouldn’t tolerate children being unable to read books — so why tolerate people being denied the tools to read the digital world?” Blumenthal said, adding that he believed the funding cuts were “mean-spirited” and “stupid.”
“This is not just a loss of funding — it’s a betrayal of public trust,” he later added. “These programs are about basic survival, finding jobs, accessing health care, communicating with your children’s schools. Rescinding this grant is cruel and senseless.”
It is unclear exactly what will happen next, but without the federal funds, it will be up to state and local governments to find a replacement. It is possible some states may consider suing the federal government to restore the digital equity funds. The Connecticut attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was considering legal action. 
The state’s broadband office, meanwhile, said in an email that it is working to ensure that Connecticut’s larger BEAD reapplication will comply with the federal government’s new guidance. 
Without the Digital Equity Act, advocates worry that any reformed broadband plans will come up short in helping the communities that need the internet the most.
“People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening.”Angela Siefer, National Digital Inclusion Alliance
“The fact that we still need [equity] programs hasn’t changed,” said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, which is leading a coalition calling for the Digital Equity Act to be restored. “People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening.” 
“What’s changed is that we don’t have this federal investment that would allow us to figure out what works,” she added. 
In Hartford, Solberg is still figuring out how the library system will move forward. With digital equity funding gone, she had to terminate the contracts for the digital navigators and their manager, a situation that she called “painful.” More than a dozen purchased laptops, intended to help residents in the community build skills, currently sit in her office. 
Solberg said it’s a depressing situation, but the library system will figure out a different way to provide support to the community. 
“The need is real, and [we] want to be part of meeting the need,” she said. “This door is closed, but we’re already thinking about other doors or a window we can climb through.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HPLDigitalWorkshopAlbany1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training, and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Wes. Moore (D) in the fiscal 2026 budget. Many of those cuts were ultimately clawed back. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The Developmental Disabilities Administration failed to collect almost $119 million in provider payments in a timely manner, despite a new payment system that’s supposed to improve the agency’s financial forecasting, a new audit says.
The payments were made to providers to help them during the transition to the new payment system, with the expectation that those dollars would be returned to the DDA. But more than 100 providers have struggled to return the payments, and as of January a total of $118.8 million was still outstanding.
Auditors believe the agency should have worked faster to recover those payments, just one of the findings in the legislative audit released Monday that found issues with oversight and financial record-keeping at an agency with an already precarious fiscal outlook.
Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, said she wasn’t surprised there were outstanding payments.
“When you transition from one complex system to another complex system – things happen,” Howell said. “Some providers, I think smaller providers, have struggled with that repayment … They’ve (state officials) allowed for a repayment plan, and we think that is a good thing.”
The audit evaluated aspects of DDA operations from June 2021 through April 20, 2024, spanning the transition from the Hogan to the Moore administration. Several concerns identified in the audit have been cited since 2009, but state auditors said in the latest report that they believe the agency is moving in the right direction.
How did we get here?: Analysts, officials unsure how disability agency overspent

One of the issues identified in the audit was a yearslong transition into a new schedule for how the state pays developmental disabilities service providers.
The DDA had used a prospective payment model — providers were paid in advance and costs were reconciled later. But in 2019, it began moving to a fee-for-service model, called the Long-Term Services Support System, that reimbursed providers after services were delivered.
Most providers switched to the new payment model in 2023 and 2024, and all were using the fee-for-service payment model by last September..
During the transition, providers were given prospective payments to get them over the hump, with those payments to be eventually returned to the state. That didn’t happen, the auditors said.
“DDA transitioned providers from the prospective payment to the fee-for-service (FFS) model during the period from December 2019 to September 2024. As a result, any prospective payments that were still outstanding needed to be recovered from the providers,” according to the audit. “Specifically, DDA did not start invoicing providers for the amounts due until February 2024, despite transitioning certain providers as early as December 2019.”
The audit also found that there was not enough information on how long those debts were outstanding – so it is not clear how much of the debts should be turned over to state debt collectors. State regulations “require three written demands for payment made at 30-day intervals” before a debt can be sent to the state’s Central Collection Unit.
The audit also said the DDA was not ensuring that people with developmental disabilities received required annual updates to their service plans.
In fiscal 2022 and 2023, the audit found, more than 1,500 people who received disability services were a year or more overdue for monitoring visits that are supposed to occur quarterly. Those visits help ensure that people are receiving adequate care and supports for their disabilities. More than 8,900 people were missing at least one required quarterly monitoring visit during that time.

In its response to the audit findings, the Department of Health, which oversees the DDA, said it was in the process of enhancing oversight of organizations tasked with conducting the quarterly face-to-face visits and the annual updates to individual service plans.
As for the outstanding payments, the department reported this month that approximately 105 providers still owe the DDA money. The department is giving those providers a chance to set up a payment plan to settle their debt. If they do not, their accounts are sent to state collections.
The department also plans to release a report and summary on the timeline of anticipated collections by September 2025.
Despite the challenges outlined in the report, state auditors believe department’s responses should be “sufficient to address all the issues.”
A written statement from the health department said that it is “encouraged by the improved accountability and compliance level rating of the latest Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) audit.”
“At the same time, we acknowledge that there are still improvements to be made as outlined in the audit responses. We will continue to work on procedures on all levels of DDA operations, including the areas of procurement and oversight procedures,” the statement said.
Howell said she appreciates that the department is making moves to ease the complexities at the DDA.
“The Developmental Disabilities Administration is an incredibly complex administration, with a very complex rate system that has gone through an extraordinary amount of change in the last six years,” she said. “I think DDA is working really hard to improve how they are managing the complexity, how they are managing the finances.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0554-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

Religious institutions in Maryland said they were already on alert before the U.S. strike on Iran this weekend. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Muslim and Jewish institutions in Maryland said they were already on high alert when U.S. strikes on Iran over the weekend just ratcheted up the level of vigilance even higher.
“All we can do is tell everyone to adhere to the very intense security protocols that have been in place for a while now, to be vigilant and to follow our procedures,” Guila Franklin Siegel, chief operating officer of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, said Monday.
That message was picked up over the weekend by government institutions around the state, which said they went on high attack Saturday on Iran and a retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar.
President Donald Trump announced the U.S. strikes Saturday evening against three Iranian nuclear sites, joining Israel in its war against Iran. Just as suddenly Monday evening, hours after the Iranian attack on the base in Qatar, Trump announced a “complete and total ceasefire” between Iran and Israel.
In the meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem briefed governors of the weekend on the threat level and on measures the government was taking to keep the homeland safe.
Gov. Wes Moore said in a Sunday news release that he had been coordinating with the Maryland Military Department and the rest of his Cabinet to ensure the safety of Marylanders locally and internationally.
Trump says ‘complete and total’ ceasefire agreed to by Iran and Israel

“We are actively working with all levels of government to remain vigilant against any potential retaliatory event,” Moore wrote. “Today, my thoughts are also with the Maryland Guard and Service members currently deployed in the Middle East and their families.”
Maryland State Police were also working closely with the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center and other agencies to assess potential impacts on the state, according to spokesperson Elena Russo.
Local Jewish and Muslim groups said they remained on high alert after the weekend’s news.
Franklin Siegel said the Jewish community had been at a heightened state of alert because of recent attacks in Colorado and Washington, and this weekend’s events didn’t change that.
Zainab Chaudry, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Maryland, said the Muslim community is facing heightened fear following the attacks. For Iranian-Americans living in Maryland, the strikes jeopardize their ability to return home or contact loved ones, she said.
“There’s a very real sense of uncertainty of the scope of the impact,” Chaudry said.
Mosques have also had heightened security generally for the past two years, Chaudry said, because of the Israel-Hamas war. This weekend’s attacks, Chaudry said, furthered already-inflamed tensions in both the United States and the Middle East.
The ongoing wars have created a “very real sense of fatigue” for those impacted in the U.S. she said.
But Franklin Siegel said the “institutional Jewish community” was “incredibly supportive both of Israel’s preemptive attack against Iran and of the United States’ actions this past weekend.”
According to Franklin Siegel, both Islamophobia and antisemitism have spiked in the recent political climate. Chaudry said the U.S. should prioritize its own people and values without getting involved in a war with Iran.
“We have so many of our own problems here at home,” Chaudry said. “We pray for the safety of all innocent civilians.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said last week the state’s Republican Party ”made a bad decision,” by endorsing Vivek Ramaswamy for governor last month.   
“The party exists to win elections, and it’s not a pretty game,” Yost said Friday during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “I’m used to getting bruised by the political process. This was just a little bit bigger bruise that I’m accustomed to.”

The Ohio Republican Party endorsed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy for governor May 9 — a year before the primary. Yost dropped out of the race a week later. 
The City Club of Cleveland originally invited Yost, who officially announced he was running for governor back in January, to speak about his platform for governor before he suspended his campaign. 
“I did offer to withdraw as speaker, but I guess it was too late to find someone more interesting,” Yost said. 
NOTUS reported that Yost asked the Trump administration for an appointment in exchange for suspending his campaign, but ultimately rejected their offer of ambassador to Cyprus. 
When asked if this was true during the forum, Yost said “I think it would be inappropriate to publicly discuss private conversations.”
Michael McIntyre, executive editor of Ideastream Public Media, asked Yost questions during the forum ranging from abortion to Yost’s future. 
Yost, who is against abortion, has appealed the decision to strike down the state’s six-week abortion ban that went into effect for several months after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio’s six-week abortion ban into law in 2019, but it was blocked in court at the time. 
When asked if Yost’s goal was to limit abortion, he said, “It is to preserve those matters that are adjacent to abortion that were passed by our duly elected general assembly, whether they fall within the rubric of the amendment of being directly or indirectly impacting or limiting the right to abortion.”
Ohioans voted to protect access to abortion, fertility treatments, contraception, and miscarriage care through a constitutional amendment in 2023, but Ohio Republican lawmakers recently introduced Ohio House Bill 370, which would ban all abortions – regardless of rape or incest. It would also outlaw IVF and IUDs. 
“I will decline, as I usually do, to take a public opinion on matters in front of the legislature because I have neither a vote nor a veto,” Yost said when asked about the bill. “If it were to pass, it would be my statutory duty under the law to defend it, regardless of whether I agreed with it or not.” 
Yost’s term as state attorney general ends January 2027, and he said he’s still thinking about what he will do next. 
“Eventually I will make a decision,” said Yost, who is term-limited. “What I can tell you is I’m not prepared to go quietly down into that good night and hope to remain active in fighting for Ohio and America’s future.” 
Two candidates have announced so far they are running for attorney general in 2026 — current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber and former Democratic state rep. Elliot Forhan.

Ramaswamy and former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill are currently the only GOP candidates running for governor, but Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel previously said he is considering running. 
Former Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton is the only Democrat running for governor and will speak at the City Club of Cleveland on Wednesday. 
Democrats are waiting to see if former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all. Currently, gaming and technology businessman Chris Volpe, of Columbus, is the only announced Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. Former state representative Elliot Forhan has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Attorney General. No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer.

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Despite fierce opposition from Maryland landowners, workers for a New Jersey based power company can access private land to survey for the proposed Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project power line, a federal judge ruled.
U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, in a 52-page opinion handed down Friday, dissected the landowners’ arguments one-by-one, including their assertion that the power company could not be granted access rights because it was not a “body politic or corporate having the power of eminent domain.”
Abelson also rejected the landowners’ attempt to dismiss the lawsuit that was filed in April by PSEG — the Public Service Enterprise Group — against more than 100 landowners along the 67-mile power line route who had refused to allow environmental surveyors on their property.
Attorneys for the landowners were still evaluating the ruling from the U.S. District Court for Maryland and determining next steps, said Joanne Frederick, one of the landowners and head of the group Stop MPRP. The groups of property owners are likely to make their decision “in the coming days,” Frederick said.
A PSEG spokesperson said landowners can expect to receive copies of the judge’s decision by certified mail within a week, but William J. Smith declined to comment on when the power company might begin notifying landowners of its intent to conduct surveys on their property.
“We appreciate the Court’s careful consideration of the facts and application of the law in this matter. We are currently reviewing the decision for the next steps in the process,” Smith wrote in a statement.
Despite efforts by lawmakers, energy bills are going up again. Here’s why.

The Piedmont project was selected by the electricity grid operator serving Maryland — PJM Interconnection — to fulfill a need for more transmission infrastructure amid power plant retirements and a surge in demand for electricity. PJM declared PSEG as the “designated entity” to develop the new line that would connect Allegheny Power System’s Doubs substation in Frederick County to Baltimore Gas and Electric’s Conastone Station in northern Baltimore County.
But now it is the Maryland Public Service Commission that must decide whether the power line should be green-lit. Maryland officials, namely the Maryland Power Plant Research Program (PPRP), concluded that various types of environmental surveys are needed for the PSC to decide whether to issue a certification for the project, called a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
Even though state officials knew some property owners were denying access to surveyors, PPRP said it “saw no option other than to direct PSEG to obtain access to properties in order to conduct ‘field studies'” of potential environmental and socioeconomic problems with the proposed route. That led to the PSEG lawsuit to force landowners to allow access.
In response to the PSEG lawsuit, the landowners argued that the company was not a “body politic or corporate having the power of eminent domain,” but would only get that power after it received the certificate from the PSC allowing the project to go ahead.
Abelson disagreed.
“That is clearly not what the General Assembly had in mind,” he wrote in his decision.
It would not make sense for the surveys to come only after the PSC made its final decision on whether the power line should move forward, since it needs the surveys to make that decision, Abelson said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The Court sees no reason to second-guess the PPRP’s determination that conducting these studies would be in the public interest,” Abelson wrote.
Abelson said that the company showed it would suffer “irreparable harm” without the ability to do the surveys, and that an injunction allowing the surveys is in the public interest.
“If the project is delayed, PSEG is likely to lose any revenue it would otherwise have received had PSEG been able to meet the June 1, 2027 in-service deadline” for the power line, Abelson wrote. “In the absence of conducting these surveys, PSEG risks a level of delay that will almost certainly entail some prospective financial harms.”
Abelson’s preliminary injunction lets PSEG representatives enter a property and “remain … to the extent reasonably necessary to make surveys, run lines or levels, or obtain information relating to the acquisition and future use of the properties in connection with the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project.” It requires that the company provide at least 24 hours of notice of its visits by “taping a notice on the front door.”
Trump follows Biden’s lead on nuclear; Maryland, other states seem to be listening

Frederick called the prospect of that happening “terrifying.”
“Speaking as a landowner … the fact that someone can simply walk up to your front door, post a notice and have unfettered access to your property? That is not acceptable,” she said.
“People are being asked to compromise their constitutional rights, or violate a federal court order,” Frederick said. “People across Maryland are being put in an untenable position.”
At least one county sheriff — Carroll County Sheriff Jim DeWees — told the Baltimore Sun after the ruling that he does not plan to enforce the court order.
“I’m still going to stand with the landowners … I’ll stand with them until the bitter end and use whatever authority I have as the sheriff to stop it,” DeWees told The Sun, which first reported the ruling.
In his ruling, Abelson noted that state law provides that anyone obstructing authorized surveyors can be “punished as for contempt of court.”
Frederick argues that PSEG is using its June 2027 deadline from PJM to expedite the proceedings, and infringe upon the rights of landowners.
“It’s not the landowners’ fault that this timeline is short,” she said. “We’re being asked to forgo our property rights because someone else is late.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

File photo from March 2024. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) called for a state of preparedness Monday amid a “hazardous heat wave” rolling across the country that threatens to raise the heat index in Maryland into the triple digits this week.
State officials are warning Marylanders to take the threat of the rising temperatures seriously.
“We ask that all Marylanders do their part to stay vigilant, stay hydrated, and stay in cool locations as much as possible,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “This State of Preparedness will ensure that Maryland is coordinated and poised to protect our people in anticipation of extreme heat and humidity.”
As of Monday evening, the National Weather Service reported that Maryland faces an extreme heat warning through Wednesday, with a heat index of up to 110 during the hottest parts of the day.
“Many Marylanders are at risk for heat-related illness during extreme heat like we are experiencing this week,” Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement.
There’s already been one heat-related death in Maryland, which came before the current heat wave hit. The health department provides only a range of data on victims, but it appears that the first heat death of the year was a female from Montgomery County between the ages of 0-17, whose death occurred before last week’s heat-related illness surveillance report was filed last Wednesday.
Maryland heads into summer with new workplace protections following deadly 2024 heat season

In recent years, the first deaths of the season have typically been males in their 40s and 50s. Last year, a total 26 people died from heat-related illnesses, the highest death toll since 2018.
As a precaution, Moore’s state of prseparedness order directs the Department of Emergency Management to coordinate state agencies to prepare for potential impacts from hazards or threats, without calling for a state of emergency.
This is also the first year that new state heat safety standards will be in place on worksites, requiring longer and more frequent breaks when the heat index reaches above 90 and 100 degrees. Employers are also expected to provide ample shade and other methods of cooling down for employees working outside and in hot conditions.
State officials hope the new standards will help reduce death and emergency room visits due to heat-related illnesses.
There have already been 164 emergency room and urgent care visits due to heat-related illnesses, according to latest weekly report from the health department.
The department has urged Marylanders to check up on vulnerable family members and on neighbors who are more susceptible to severe heat illnesses.
“Marylanders are advised to never leave children in a car,” the department said last week. “Always check twice to ensure that a vehicle is empty. Even on a 70-degree day, within half an hour, the temperature inside the vehicle can climb to over 100 degrees.”
The department reminds Marylanders to drink plenty of fluids to help cope with the hot weather and urges folks to avoid alcohol, caffeine and overly sweetened beverages. Officials also encourage wearing sunscreen and staying in the shade when possible. Those in need of a cool location can contact their local health departments or call 211 to find the nearest cooling center.
“Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to this weather — including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases,” Seshamani said. “Be sure that they have the resources they need to stay comfortable and safe, or help them locate one of the dozens of local cooling centers available.”

(Getty Images)Right now, Congress is debating changes to two programs that serve as lifelines for working families and individuals in Maryland and across the country.
A bill that passed the House of Representatives last month could significantly weaken our nation’s safety net by cutting nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called food stamps) and $625 billion from Medicaid over 10 years. Both programs aid low-income individuals and families who are weathering tough times to get back on their feet.
This is one of the most substantial reductions in the SNAP program’s history. Nationwide, millions of Americans will see reductions to their benefits, or lose benefits entirely.
Stricter eligibility requirements will disqualify people who are in need, especially older adults and parents. Work-reporting mandates — including for parents of young children — will lead to loss of benefits for those unable to navigate the system, even if they are working.
The loss of funding for these programs would be devastating for Maryland as well, and not just in the ways most people expect.

First, cutting SNAP and Medicaid will increase poverty and food insecurity for working families, children and older adults living at or under the federal poverty level. Nearly 130,000 Marylanders currently on SNAP would be at risk of losing some benefits. An estimated 71,000 Marylanders would lose SNAP benefits entirely; approximately 200,000 Marylanders would lose their health care due to Medicaid cuts.
At the Maryland Food Bank, we know that even with the help of SNAP, many families in our state struggle to afford food. With as many as 1 in 3 people in our state already facing food insecurity, fewer resources will force neighbors to make tradeoffs – like skipping meals and purchasing cheaper, less nutritious food.
Further tightening eligibility requirements will mean that even fewer people will be able to afford the healthy groceries they need to work, learn and contribute to their communities. Eating less nutritious food can have long-term health consequences, particularly for children and vulnerable populations.
While these negative outcomes should be enough to give us pause, there’s less obvious harm that will result from the current proposal to cut benefits. What might surprise many is that the House bill would force states to shoulder much more of the costs of both SNAP and Medicaid, at a time when everyday costs are rising, and state leaders are already tightening belts.
The added financial impact of having to pick up a portion of SNAP program costs could lead to cuts to other essential services like education and health care, or infrastructure or tax increases, placing further strain on Maryland residents.
While we don’t frequently talk about the economic impact of SNAP and Medicaid, cutting these benefits would also have repercussions on businesses across the state. The core of our work at the Maryland Food Bank is to provide access to nutritious food so that communities can thrive. That goes beyond providing a meal today. We want to build a food system that is resilient, equitable, and accessible for all – and that means supporting local economies.
More than 3,800 grocery stores and food retailers in Maryland accept SNAP benefits. According to a recent analysis by the National Grocers Association, SNAP funding supports approximately 31,600 jobs in Maryland and $1.6 billion in direct wages. That translates to over $289 million in state and $333 million in federal tax revenue.
People who have lost benefits will have less to spend at the grocery store and will be more reliant on the 780 food pantries and other feeding sites that partner with the Maryland Food Bank. That means less money powering our economy, and more strain on the food assistance network.
Cutting SNAP is bad for business in Maryland, and it’s bad for families. And this is urgent: The current timeline for the Senate to consider changes to SNAP and Medicaid leaves just days before 3.2 million people lose SNAP benefits. At a time when our neighbors need help the most, these critical programs must be kept in place – for Marylanders and for Maryland’s economy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 05:01:14.955708

She's studying the effects of earlier urban renewal projects in the community. (Tara Wallace)My nonprofit, the Lighthouse Therapeutic Community Outreach Foundation, has launched a study to understand the long-term socioeconomic and psychological impacts of displacement caused by the construction of the U.S. Interstate System and urban renewal projects in Topeka during the 1950s and 1960s. This study centers the voices of those most affected, those who lived through the bulldozing of homes, businesses and neighborhoods such as “The Bottoms,” along with those who inherited trauma through broken generational ties and systemic divestment.
The goal of Lighthouse TCOF is to give voice to the experience of displacement. And to plot its impact from a generational perspective. For me as a trauma therapist, it informs the work I do to understand how past traumas contribute to present challenges. Namely, the adverse human health and environmental effects stemming from the original project, as well as subsequent traumatization or retraumatization from the current one.
The Polk-Quincy Viaduct project is billed as a modern infrastructure improvement. But the question must be asked, improvement for whom? The original highway displaced hundreds of families, most of them Black families. Decades later, these same communities face renewed disruption without adequate outreach, input, or compensation.
Even more concerning is that this project is happening during massive rollbacks in funding for social service programs and resources. These cuts directly affect access to mental health services, basic needs and housing support, workforce development, and youth services in already under-resourced neighborhoods. These are the very services needed to repair the damage from past displacement, not just to survive it again.
The environmental, health, and quality of life effects of urban renewal projects are often underestimated or ignored despite federal expectations of accountability. The Polk-Quincy expansion could potentially worsen air quality, limit recreational access, and destroy cultural and historic spaces — many of which remain undocumented or are only now being recognized as sites of generational significance.
Studies show that communities near highways suffer higher rates of asthma, chronic stress, and mental health problems. Add to this the cumulative effects of economic hardship, housing instability, and cultural erasure, and the cost is far greater than any environmental impact statement suggests.
This study seeks to document those effects, not just historically, but as they are still felt today. We are inviting community members and descendants of displaced families to complete a survey and, for those selected, participate in interviews. The data will provide a powerful basis for community-driven policy recommendations, advocacy, and reparative considerations.
This isn’t just research. It is truth-telling. It is an act of justice.
To move forward, we need more than widened roads. We need conciliation, equity, and representation. That means pausing to ask whose voices are missing from urban renewal conversations. It means restoring what was taken through community investment, historical preservation and actual, enforceable protections for those most affected.
The federal government may be cutting resources, but we do not have to cut out the people who have carried the socioeconomic and psychological weight of urban renewal for generations.
We must not repeat the past by forgetting it.
If you or someone you know was affected by Topeka’s urban renewal or the construction of the highway system in the 1950s and 1960s, we invite you to share your story. Participate in the study. Speak truth to power. Help us ensure that progress does not come at the cost of justice, once again.

Every time the vice-president is before an open mic he seems to revert to cutting diatribes about people MAGA loves to hate or alternative facts that bely reality. That’s not leadership from someone a heartbeat away from the presidency. That’s venom masquerading as virtue and promoting Orwellian “War is Peace” propaganda. 
Vance has mastered the dark art of manipulating thought through ignore-the-evidence Trumpian rhetoric. He excels at stoking unfounded fear or fanning unquestioned loyalty whenever the boss requires subterfuge as a means to an end. 
Hours after Trump unilaterally (and arguably unconstitutionally) chose to launch an unprovoked attack against Iran early Sunday (without the authorization of Congress) Vance was spouting the doublespeak of Team Trump on Sunday morning talk shows to portray America’s abrupt entry into foreign combat with Israel as a proud accomplishment.
To be clear, the U.S. inserted itself into a hot war by impulsively bombing a sovereign nation on the pretext of an imminent nuclear weapons threat — contradicted by Trump’s own U.S. intelligence community. 
Iranian leaders called America’s act of aggression against their country “unprecedently dangerous” and a “betrayal of diplomacy.” But Vance peered into network cameras and pretended the unforced decision by the U.S. to drop more than a dozen 30,000-pound bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities was not what it looked like to the rest of the world.
“We’re not at war with Iran,” said Vance with a straight face. “We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program” — the same one U.S spy agencies and U.S. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard determined was dormant before Trump sent B-2 stealth bombers into Iranian airspace. 
“We do not want war with Iran,” prattled the Ohio poser in the wake of the largest operational strike ever by those bombers to take out Iranian nuclear sites. “We actually want peace.” 
Despite preemptive attacks certain to inflame greater conflict in an already volatile region.

In an awkward tap dance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Vance tried to pivot from his longtime opposition to proactive military intervention in the Middle East. 
As an Ohio senatorial candidate Vance was adamant about not supporting military action against Iran on its own soil — even as proxy militia groups escalated attacks on U.S. and coalition forces. 
But the staunch isolationist did a 180 on Trump’s recklessness in dragging the U.S. into another sketchy war without an end game. 
Trump was smarter than his predecessors when it came to targeting Tehran with American military muscle, Vance argued unconvincingly, so the risk of the U.S. succumbing to another endless war was slim.  
“I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East,” said the ex-Marine who served in the Iraq entanglement. “I understand the concern, but the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents, and now we have a president who actually knows how to accomplish America’s national security objectives.” 
Trump directly threatened those objectives by alienating nearly every international partner and ally of the U.S., aligning with autocratic Russia against democratic Ukraine, destroying the federal national security workforce, and eliminating irreplaceable expertise, decimating global foreign assistance investments, nuclear safety protections, cyber security, and more.
But when Trump plunged the U.S. into a Middle East conflict with his bombardment of Iran, he knew exactly who to deploy to disingenuously frame America’s military pounding of that country as preventative medicine to reset fruitful diplomacy and spur peace. 
Vance shelved his skepticism about starting foreign wars without clear objectives or exit strategies and gamely pushed a narrative that Iran essentially had it coming but rest assured the U.S. has “no interest in boots on the ground” or Iranian regime change. Maybe.   
Yet the veep deals in dishonesty like a chameleon changes color. A day before Trump announced his bombing strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, Vance was in Los Angeles lying through his teeth about the Democratic mayor of the city and governor of the state encouraging violent immigration protests. 
Then he disparaged a former Senate colleague from California who was slammed to the ground and handcuffed at a press conference when he tried to ask the Homeland Security director a question. Vance referred to U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla” (a convicted domestic terrorist) and suggested his ordeal was “political theater.”
Why did Vance spew “lies and utter nonsense in an attempt to provoke division and conflict in our city?” asked LA Mayor Karen Bass. Why did Vance mock the first Latino elected to the U.S. Senate by intentionally misnaming him? 
Same reason he put an Ohio city and its Haitian community in danger with savage lies about pet-eating immigrants: To snag attention, stoke ugly, and distort truth beyond recognition. 
A slick Vance played his fellow citizens for chumps with Trumped-up bull that American troops belong on American streets and a wanton act of war by the U.S. isn’t. That’s not leadership. That’s a glib gaslighting from a cringe-making toady.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Janet Mills gives the State of the State address on Jan. 30, 2024. (Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills blocked legislation seeking to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use, one of several of her first vetoes this year announced on Monday.  
The Maine Legislature passed the bill, LD 958, with bipartisan support earlier this month, winning over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty.
However, a veto was expected and initial votes on the bill indicate there is likely not enough support to override it. Mills’ legal counsel made her opposition clear while the bill was still in committee, arguing such a ban could prevent the state government from addressing unpredictable future infrastructure needs. 
Mills repeated some of the same reasons in her veto letter dated June 20, including that the bill would amount to a “permanent and irrevocable change to state law” — a critique leaders of the Wabanaki Nations have refuted in light of the several recent changes the state has made to grant the Tribes more sovereignty. LD 958 was seen as the next piece of those reforms.
Most other federally recognized tribes are already afforded protection against states being able to seize tribal land for public use. However, the Wabanaki Nations are not, due to repercussions from the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
Governor opposed to latest change to Settlement Act backed by Wabanaki Nations

The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws. 
In 1834, the federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress, but the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Wabanaki Nations.
Overall, this land settlement agreement has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations like other federally recognized tribes. Overhauling this act in its entirety is the Wabanaki Nations’ broader goal for greater recognition of their sovereignty — sweeping reform Mills has opposed, opting instead for some targeted, piecemeal changes. 
“The Legislature cannot unilaterally repeal or amend the new language in the future, even if problems with that language become obvious later,” Mills wrote in her veto letter. She’s referring to the fact that federal law authorizes the Maine Legislature to make changes to the act, but only with the consent of the affected Tribes. 
“The Legislature should understand that this bill would permanently deny the state the ability to take even small portions of Tribal Lands abutting public rights of way for uses like road and bridge projects no matter what circumstances may arise many years into the future,” Mills wrote.
However, in recent years, the Legislature has passed, and the Tribes have later ratified, changes to that act, such as expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes, permitting the Tribes to handle sports betting and ensuring the Tribes receive the benefits and protections of the Violence Against Women Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act — several of which Mills highlighted in her letter. 
But Mills went on to write that she views the changes sought in LD 958 as counter to those other recent successes. 
Noting the legislative strides came as a result of numerous meetings and conversations, she wrote, “Never once in these discussions did any Tribal leader mention the issue of state eminent domain authority as a problem that should be addressed.” 
The state has not exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act. Mills pointed to this fact when arguing “LD 958 is a solution in search of a problem.” 
However, Wabanaki leaders have argued it instead shows that the state’s current ability to exercise eminent domain over tribal lands is not actually clear and that any such attempts would likely result in litigation, providing more reason to clarify rights now in the bill. 
The Legislature will have a chance to override Mills’ veto, but after the Maine House of Representatives voted 86-60 and the Senate 20-12, it looks unlikely the chambers can secure the two-thirds threshold that is needed to do so. 
Mills has vetoed four other bills so far this session.
LD 588 sought to give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer. 
LD 1802 aimed to clarify when an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. 
LD 1731 would require the state ferry service to consult with an advisory board on matters related to the service, budget, strategic planning and major operational decisions. 
LD 1328 sought to create culturally appropriate and trauma-informed residences to provide services to underserved, underrepresented or disparately impacted individuals in recovery from substance use disorder.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderRoe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case enshrining abortion rights across the country, was overturned three years ago today in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, intensifying a yearslong battle over access to reproductive health care in Georgia.
The fallout of the Dobbs decision is continuing to cause ripple effects throughout the state, with advocates on both sides gearing up for a fight that will play out — at least in part — at the ballot box in 2026.
For Democrats, who are hoping to see incumbent U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff reelected for another term, access to reproductive health care is a crucial part of the campaign. High-profile cases of Georgia women whose deaths have been tied to Georgia’s six-week abortion ban have also cast a national spotlight onto the state’s restrictive laws.
Georgia’s law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually at about six weeks and before most women know they are pregnant. 
  April Newkirk, mother of Adriana Smith, the brain-dead pregnant Georgia woman being kept on life support, attended a somber event marking what would have been Smith’s 31st birthday on June 15 at Park Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother and nurse, was roughly two months pregnant when she was declared brain dead after experiencing a series of blood clots in mid February. Doctors told Smith’s family that while she had no chance of recovery, her organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law.
Months later her baby, Chance, was delivered by emergency cesarean section and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, weighing one pound 13 ounces. The family said they planned to take Smith off life support last week.
Two other Georgians, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, both died in 2022 after suffering complications from taking abortion pills. Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited nearly a day to perform a routine procedure to remove fetal tissue from her uterus; Miller died after family members said she was afraid to seek medical care because of the recently enacted six-week abortion ban.
At a press conference held in front of a mural depicting Thurman and Miller, members of the Democratic Party of Georgia criticized the state’s law, citing cases like Thurman, Miller and Smith’s as evidence of the danger Georgia’s ban poses for those seeking reproductive health care.
“We’ve seen multiple women tragically lose their lives and all because some fat cat politicians think that they know better than women, they know better than those women’s families, they know better than doctors about how to make health care decisions about women’s own bodies,”  said Charlie Bailey, who chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia. 
Republicans running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 include Congressman Buddy Carter, who represents a district in coastal Georgia, and Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King, who have both praised Georgia’s six-week abortion ban. Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, is also seen as a potential contender for the race, though he has not announced his candidacy.
  Rep. Shea Roberts. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
State Rep. Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, highlighted the turmoil Georgia’s abortion restrictions pose for doctors trying to administer care for pregnant patients, and criticized Republicans’ response to the ban’s repercussions.
“Georgia’s abortion laws are vague, often leaving doctors and hospitals scrambling with their lawyers instead of giving patients the care they need,” Roberts said. “These women should be alive today, and they should still be with their families, yet Carter, King and Collins have stood by the very ban that led to these deaths.”
However, state Sen. Ed Setzler, an Acworth Republican who authored Georgia’s six-week abortion ban, said he celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
“When the Dobbs decision came down, we were overjoyed because it gave legislatures, gave the elected representatives, the people, the ability to handle these very, very difficult circumstances, and balance the very difficult circumstances women find themselves in with the basic right to life of a living, distinct child, and our state took it very seriously,” he said. 
  Sen. Ed Setzler, right, authored Georgia’s six-week abortion ban in 2019. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Setzler also defended his legislation, officially called the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, arguing that provisions aimed at helping pregnant Georgians recover child support during their pregnancies and allowing them to claim “unborn children” on their taxes provided families with extra support that other states’ bans did not include.
“Our state had worked in a very careful and balanced way to give balance to these difficult circumstances with the life of a child in a way that I think was thoughtful,” he added. “Many other states I don’t think took the time that we did to work through that, and I’m proud of the work we did.”
He also criticized Georgia’s Democratic Party, saying it was “sickening” that the party “seizes all these tragic circumstances to try to score points.”
However, reproductive health care advocates argue that restrictions on abortion have caused downstream effects that limit health care access for all Georgians and impact rural residents of the state most acutely.
“The effect Georgia’s abortion ban has on our health system is felt all over the state,” said Jaylen Black, the vice president of marketing and communications for Planned Parenthood Southeast. “Doctors are fleeing the state. Some of them won’t move to Georgia. Medical students avoid residency programs in our state, and that makes it harder for Georgians to get the care that they so desperately need.”
The yearslong court battle over Georgia’s abortion ban
Georgia’s six-week abortion ban was briefly overturned last year in a ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who declared the state’s law unconstitutional after the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective filed a lawsuit in state court in 2022. 
That action was short-lived. The Supreme Court of Georgia quickly reinstated the ban after Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr filed an emergency injunction, allowing the restriction to remain in effect while the court considered a narrow portion of the lawsuit.
However, an unrelated state Supreme Court ruling from earlier this year has complicated the plaintiffs’ case. Wasserman v. Franklin County, which was decided in January, created a new precedent that prevents third-party entities from suing on behalf of someone else. As a result, abortion rights advocates like SisterSong are now unable to file lawsuits on behalf of their patients.
“At a minimum, a plaintiff must assert her own rights to maintain an action in Georgia courts,” the Supreme Court stated in a February ruling in the abortion case.
The case now sits with the Fulton County Superior Court, where McBurney will evaluate whether the plaintiffs still have standing to bring the lawsuit.
“For a second time, the Supreme Court has elected not to address this case on its merits (other than to stay this Court’s ruling on the merits),” McBurney wrote in an order this month. 
The parties now have until July 21 to submit briefs that incorporate the two Supreme Court rulings before the case can proceed.

HB 5002 offered Connecticut a path out of its housing crisis, which will now assuredly worsen.","HB 5002, a bold housing bill passed by both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature, has died ignominiously. 
Gov. Ned Lamont has chosen to veto the bill, torpedoing his own party’s legislation. While Republicans cheer and a few Democrats breathe a sigh of relief, the bill’s defeat is a bad omen. HB 5002 offered the state a path out of its housing crisis, which will now assuredly worsen.
While opposition from the Republican Party was uniform, responsibility for the demise of HB 5002 ultimately falls on members of the Democratic Party. Despite strong backing from policy experts and advocates, influential voices from Connecticut’s wealthier suburbs formed a Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) coalition with the GOP, and persuaded Lamont to adopt a baffling stance on the home-affordability issue: deer-in-headlights indecision. This political inaction will harm young families, working folks, and the Democratic Party nationwide.
Why are homes so expensive here, anyways? Connecticut offers a high quality of life, strong public services, and access to major cultural and commercial hubs. Its climate is mild and under Lamont, the state has enjoyed fiscal stability. Unsurprisingly, many want to live here. But outdated zoning rules, defended by homeowners through local planning boards, make it hard to increase housing supply in order to keep up with demand. HB 5002 aimed to excise the regulations that make housing such a scarce, and thus expensive, commodity.
Some shrug off the crisis, “Not everyone gets to live in nice places.” But the people being priced out aren’t just undeserving out-of-state supplicants; they’re the next generation. Young people who did everything right, went to college and landed white-collar jobs, still can’t afford a modest home in much of Connecticut. When home costs explode it’s not just outsiders who are made to suffer.
Additionally, experts agree: the primary driver of homelessness is the price of housing. HB 5002 would have cut the red tape that chokes housing supply, lowering costs. With its veto, we can expect to see more people suffering the indignity of being unhoused in our public spaces. 
Those who are not homeless, but home-insecure (spending over 30% of their income on housing) will also feel the pinch. When supply is constrained and demand remains high, it’s not the 23-year-old software engineer who gets priced out; it’s the single mother working as a waitress. Democrats oppose gentrification, but by obstructing home construction, they make it inevitable.
So why would Democrats help kill a bill that would uplift groups they claim to support: working folks, the unhoused, and young families?
Many opposed HB 5002 because it would have taken planning prerogatives out of the hands of local communities, rules about what kind of housing can be built and where, and parking mandates. These rules may seem trivial, but suggesting their repeal sparks backlash. Progressive opponents of deregulation argue that greedy developers cannot be trusted to determine parking needs without a mandate. They believe that local authorities know what housing will fit best, not the imperious invisible hand of the free market. Others insist that new housing must wait for transportation upgrades, but then build neither bike paths nor homes.
Some of the objections were made in good faith. It’s fair to be skeptical of developer motives or to want growth that aligns with community character. But when the fear of hypothetical problems paralyzes us, existing issues only become worse. HB 5002 was imperfect, but by letting perfect become the enemy of the good, Democrats have made a grievous error.
I hope Connecticut’s legislators refocus on the housing crisis next session with unity and urgency. Democrats who lobbied Lamont to kill HB 5002 must recognize that their resistance to new housing does not just harm vulnerable communities, but also their own party’s continued survival.
After the 2020 census, congressional seats shifted. Liberal strongholds like New York and California lost representation in the House and have diminished power in presidential elections, while red states like Texas and Florida have gained influence. Why? Red states are building affordable homes, and people are voting with their feet.  No matter how desirable life is in California, New York, or Connecticut, if people can’t afford to live there, they’ll leave. When Democrats in blue states choke housing construction they sap their own electoral strength. By loudly insisting that you support more affordable housing, just not in your neighborhood, you make a Democratic candidate’s path to the presidency that much narrower.
In an earlier commentary, I compared the passage of HB 5002 to bitter but necessary medicine. By scrapping the bill, promising vague “improvements” in a future legislative session, Lamont and anti-housing Democrats have declined a shot of penicillin in order to explore the restorative possibilities of snake oil.

On Friday June 13, Israel unleashed an enormously complex campaign of strikes to thwart Iran’s imminent acquisition of nuclear weapons. A week later, at President Trump’s direction, America’s B2 bombers finished off the last underground nuclear site that lay beyond Israel’s reach.
Yet within hours of Israel’s opening salvos, several of the world’s self-appointed moral arbiters unleashed a wave of verbal attacks, condemning Israel’s and then Trump’s efforts to spare the world the nightmare of Iran’s genocidal dictators going nuclear.
From far off in peaceful Geneva, the World Council of Churches thundered its condemnation, denouncing Israeli “aggression [that] endangers the entire Middle East region.” Notably absent from that declaration was any mention of Iran’s decades of dangerous aggression, like its funding and arming terror brigades across the region, and its constant threats to genocidally obliterate Israel.
Likewise, from its plush headquarters in Washington D.C., Churches for Middle East Peace “condemn[ed] in the strongest possible terms” Israel’s having “risk[ed] the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the Middle East.” Here too Iran’s history of Mideast murder and mayhem escaped condemnation from those self-appointed voices of peace.
Democratic party leaders issued similar one-sided denunciations, including Connecticut U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, who declared: “This is a disaster of Trump and Netanyahu’s own making” – as if Iran had no role in fomenting the crisis.
Similar denunciations followed America’s subsequent strike on the underground Fordo site. The U.N. Secretary General scolded Trump’s “dangerous escalation,” while Murphy returned to denounce Trump as “dangerously reckless.”
Several prominent human rights non-profits also joined the pile-on, denouncing the strikes while keeping silent about Iran’s oft-declared intent to annihilate Israel. Amnesty International, American Friends Service Committee, Foundation for Middle East Peace, and several others deployed their taxpayer-subsidized influence to defend this upside-down moral position.
In fact, the moral and geopolitical landscape is the precise opposite of what those voices of denunciation claim. And this is far from a close call: the difference between the right and wrong actors is highly visible and manifestly obvious. That difference is highlighted by the following critical facts – all neglected by the West’s army of moral scolds:
First as noted, Iran has for decades declared ad nauseum its commitment to the genocidal annihilation of Israel. Its leaders endlessly call for “the complete obliteration of the Zionist regime,” and pledge again and again “the destruction of the cancerous microbe Israel.”
Second, far from that being mere rhetoric, Iran has invested massively in this genocidal project. It financed and armed a murderous ring of terror armies encircling Israel: Hamas to the southwest, Houthis to the southeast, Syria-based militias to the northeast, and Hezbollah to the north. Intelligence sources recently revealed Iran’s plans to unleash those terror armies all at once, in a surprise attack “from all sides, with thousands of terrorists.” In other words, a massively larger replay of Hamas’s October 7 genocidal horrors.
Third, Iran’s annihilationist goals extend far beyond Israel, with America at the top of its target list. Its leaders constantly call for “Death to America.” Iran has orchestrated numerous killings of Americans, including: the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, killing 241 U.S. troops; Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq that killed over 600 American soldiers; Iranian bounty payments for Taliban attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan; three Americans murdered by a drone attack in Jordan; and years of Houthi attacks on U.S. ships.
Iran’s shadow war on America also includes its brazen plots to carry out assassinations of both ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Donald Trump.
Fourth, negotiating Iran off its path to nuclear capacity was never a possible option. The 2015 JCPOA – the “best” deal available – was riddled with holes: it banned no-notice inspections; and it explicitly permitted Iran to build nuclear weapons after ten years. Insisting on negotiations as the sole approach to Iran means in actuality, guaranteeing a nuclear Iran.
But fifth and most dangerous is the nuclear arms race set to take off once Iran reaches nuclear capacity. Many experts have warned that once Iran goes nuclear, the Saudis, Turks, and likely other regimes would all launch nuclear weapons efforts. By eliminating Iran’s nuclear program now, Israel and America prevented the imminent launch of a nuclear arms race across the Islamic world.
These facts illuminate the morally bankrupt reasoning of the Israel-Trump scolds. They condemn both parties for preventing a second Holocaust and for precluding a catastrophic Mideast nuclear arms race. Worse, they offer nothing else that could prevent the genocidal Iranian dictatorship from building a horrifying arsenal of nuclear weapons.
These hard realities make clear that there is one, and only one, morally serious response to Israel’s and President Trump’s take-down of Iran’s nuclear program. Namely: Thank you Israel, and thank you President Trump – for acting when no one else would, and for walking humanity back off the path to nuclear Armageddon.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT HB 5002: So many things wrong,Carmen Lopez,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/ct-hb-5002-so-many-things-wrong/,There are so many things wrong with this 92-page bill that it is a daunting challenge to even find a place to start.,"After witnessing the twists and turns utilized by Connecticut’s General Assembly leadership to pass House Bill 5002, now known as PA 25-49, I am reminded of the maxim attributed to Mark Twain and/or Otto Van Bismark, “if you like law or sausages, you shouldn’t watch either being made.”
There was serious sausage making going on during the debate on this bill. There are so many things wrong with this 92-page bill that it is a daunting challenge to even find a place to start.
The bill is so confusing and internally inconsistent that Gov. Ned Lamont, on whose desk the bill sits waiting for his signature or veto, remarked, “the question is, do you sign it and fix the bill later, or don’t sign it and get a new bill that takes down the temperature a little bit.” [Lamont vetoed the bill Monday.– Ed.]
Governor, the responsible course is to veto now and fix later!
There are powerful voices who support this bill. They are engaged in smug virtue signaling concern for the poor and homeless. However, they avoid anything so mundane as analyzing the actual language of the bill adopted by the General Assembly. They love high blown rhetoric, but don’t wish to be confused by the actual language of the bill.
The proponents of the bill provide us with an example of the concern and compassion they claim to have for the poor when they pontificate from on high, in Section 2 of the bill.
This section reads that zoning regulations, “shall not require a minimum number of off-street motor vehicle parking spaces for any residential development except as provided in section 3.”
It appears that in the world inhabited by the “Guardians of the Poor,” most of us need parking, but somehow, the poor do not.
This means that a local planning and zoning commission cannot deny an application for a residential development for lack of off-street parking, a bonanza for high-density development and another burden for the working poor.
So much for Connecticut’s tradition of local control!
Central planners have issued an edict that ‘experts’ know what is best for a local community, with a one-size fits all approach.
This section unambiguously removes the discretion from a local commission to make decisions regarding off-street parking.
As an afterthought during the sausage making, (due to the uproar raised by residents throughout Connecticut) a narrow exception to the ‘no minimum off-street parking requirement was added in a new Section 3. The new language does not remove the “no minimum off street parking’ prohibition but rather puts an additional burden on the municipal zoning commission to justify a rejection based upon parking considerations. The Commission must make a finding “that a lack of such parking will have a specific adverse impact on public health and safety.”
This is a difficult burden for a commission to meet.
This section also requires that all applications for residential developments of over 24 dwelling units shall include a “parking needs assessment” that provides an analysis of options that may be used by residents to mitigate the need for off-street parking.
The 24-unit cut off is an arbitrary figure. Developments of less than 24 dwelling units are not required to provide an assessment of parking needs.
The experts have not provided us with an explanation for the distinction. Nor have they adequately explained why no state in the U.S. has a statewide policy of no minimum off street parking requirement. Perhaps, it is because it does not work.
One such development in Bridgeport has put a face on the reality of the consequences of this ruling from on high.
In an already congested area, without an effective mass transit system, where all children qualify for free lunches in the public schools, a 74-unit residential development with 900 square feet of commercial space on the first floor, and no off-street parking has been approved on a postage stamp size lot on East Main Street.
This is not because of HB 5002, but rather because many of the experts influencing HB 5002 were busy at work in Bridgeport revising the local zoning regulations during COVID. Minimum off-street parking requirements were eliminated in the rewriting of the regulations.
This Bridgeport development is the fruit of the seeds planted during the invasion of the experts under cover of COVID. It helps us read the tea leaves.
Sadly, Michael Chuchev, in an op-ed published on June 20, describes the elimination of off-street parking minimums as a positive effect on “some of the worst excesses of municipal zoning.”
If he could only walk in the shoes of someone who in real time will be affected by the consequences of this bill, such as a single mother and sole breadwinner hunting for a parking space after a 3 to 11 shift. But the elite central planners are far removed from East Main Street in Bridgeport.
Yes, Governor, you can turn down the temperature on this bill.
Your honest statement that you wished you had been involved in negotiating the language of this bill earlier is to be commended and applauded. Your healthy skepticism is warranted and appreciated.
Please veto this bill and call the legislature into special session to get this sausage making right with a new recipe that includes input from all impacted parties.

Over a dozen people spoke out against the proposal at a town hall in Omaha hosted by Nebraska Appleseed and the American Cancer Society Action Network. Speakers included state senators, medical professionals, activists and everyday Nebraskans. All said the current proposal would have disastrous consequences for health care access across the state.

“It’s been across the board, people are raising the alarm bells as to just how harmful this is going to be,” said State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. 
Congress is currently considering a budget reconciliation bill that would accomplish several goals President Donald Trump campaigned on. Among many other things, the proposal would scale back Medicaid benefits nationwide. 
A version of the bill has already passed the House, and Senate leaders say they’re hoping to vote on their version soon, with the goal to send the bill to Trump’s desk by July 4. 
With the Senate bill still in flux, Monday’s town hall focused on the House version of the bill, according to Nebraska Appleseed program director Sarah Maresh. Under the bill, Maresh said up to 55,000 Nebraskans could lose their health care coverage, and the state itself could lose roughly $4 billion in federal funding for the program. 
Even for people on private insurance, Maresh said the House proposal would have widespread negative impacts on Nebraska’s health care industry. For one, she said wait times in emergency rooms would likely increase, as more people are forced to put off preventative treatment until their ailments grow un-ignorable. 
“Everyone is going to feel the impacts of these cuts,” Maresh said. 
Prokop said the funding cuts would shift more burden onto state governments and noted that Nebraska has already faced tough budget challenges this year that are likely to continue. 
Trevor Toteve, policy analyst for OpenSky Policy Institute, said the cap on provider taxes included in the bill would halve federal funds slated to come to Nebraska from a hospital assessment bill state lawmakers passed last year. 
Prokop also said the bill goes against the Medicaid expansion Nebraska voters passed in 2018, continuing a trend established in the Legislature this session of some state leaders ignoring the will of voters. His remark prompted audible murmurs of agreement from the crowd. 
What Nebraska’s congressional delegates have to say
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has expressed hesitance in supporting Medicaid cuts, but he voted for them after he said he received assurances that the bill would not degrade the quality of health care for people covered by Medicaid. He said he supports provisions of the bill that would impose work requirements on able-bodied adults and bar people in the country illegally from accessing coverage. 
“Requiring able-bodied adults to work, removing those enrolled twice or not here in the country legally and a yearly audit are easy to defend,” Bacon said in an emailed statement. 
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., had similar thoughts to Bacon’s, saying that he wants to address “waste, fraud and abuse,” while ensuring that vulnerable Americans retain access to Medicaid.
Creighton University medical student Marshall Biven called comments like theirs “disinformation” on Monday, noting that migrants without documentation already aren’t allowed to access Medicaid. 
In response to House passage of the bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., celebrated the “historic tax relief” he said the bill would provide and argued that it would “refocus” Medicaid on its core mission. 
“These common sense conservative policies are a victory for the American people, and we urge our colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly so that the president can sign this bill into law,” Flood said. 
Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer’s office declined to comment on the town hall. The office of fellow GOP U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts had no immediate response to a request for comment. 
More concerns expressed
Maresh addressed the arguments favoring the work requirements proposed in the bill, claiming similar strategies have proven ineffective in encouraging more people to work. 
Edison McDonald, executive director of National Disability Action, expanded on this, saying that while he was leading a past business, a disabled employee declined a promotion he offered her because it would make her ineligible for her $60,000 annual Medicaid coverage. 
“What I’ve seen through my time is how frustrating the process is,” McDonald said. “How many times the government gets in the way of encouraging work.” 
Biven, the Creighton medical student, argued a provision of the bill that would cap student loan borrowing would further discourage students from entering medical school. The maximum cap up for consideration is $200,000, and Biven said he is on track to be roughly $400,000 in loan debt by the time he graduates in 2028.
Ann Anderson Berry, executive director of the Child Health Research Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said the bill would have major impacts on Nebraska’s maternal health care field, which was already struggling. 
She said Nebraska currently ranks fifth for maternal health care deserts, places with the longest distance to travel to access maternal health care, and is also dealing with rising infant mortality rates. Further cuts would only continue to harm access, she said. 
“I can’t think of a worse decision for Nebraska families,” Berry said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/Source New Mexico)The U.S. Forest Service will seek to repeal a rule that has effectively blocked the logging of almost a third of America’s national forests, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told a meeting of Western governors on Monday in New Mexico.
The “Roadless Rule” has blocked the construction of new roads in wild areas of most states’ national forests since 2001, when it was imposed in the closing days of President Bill Clinton’s presidency.
“In this administration, we are taking a look under the hood of each and every regulation that affects the everyday lives of the American people, and this rule certainly affects the everyday lives of every single American living in the American West,” Rollins told officials assembled at the Western Governors Association meeting. 
“That’s why I’m excited to announce today here with you, for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous Roadless Rule. The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests under the leadership of President Trump,” she said.
Lifting the rule would allow the construction of roads, a needed prerequisite for development and logging, in significant parts of the Tongass National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rainforest on Earth. Ninety-two percent of the Tongass is considered a roadless area.
“There’s no doubt about it, we are continuing to be aggressive in our efforts to increase American timber production in line with President Trump’s agenda,” Rollins said.
Rollins’ announcement was criticized by environmental groups, who vowed to oppose it.
“Secretary Rollins is taking a blowtorch to a landmark rule that shields almost 60 million acres of national forests from the serious impacts roads can have, not only on wildlife and their habitats but also on the nation’s drinking water sources,” said Vera Smith, director of national forests and lands for Defenders of Wildlife, a national group. 
“America’s roadless forests are crucial strongholds for wildlife including at-risk species that are battling extinction. Sec. Rollins’ boon to industry is yet another punishing blow to the American people and the wildlife and wild places we all hold dear,” Smith said in a written statement.
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, particularly in Alaska, where most of the California-sized Tongass is covered by the rule.
Republican presidents have sought to reduce or eliminate the rule and have been opposed in court by environmental groups. Democratic presidents have sought to keep the rule and have been opposed by logging and development trade groups.
If the Roadless Rule were a box, almost all of the action since 2001 has taken place within that box, as groups attempt to exempt certain states or parts of states.
The new rulemaking process announced by Rollins would throw out the box altogether.
“What Secretary Rollins pledged today was to rescind the whole Roadless Rule, the whole enchilada,” said Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at the law firm Earthjustice.
More than 96% of roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and Alaska alone has almost 15 million acres of roadless area, mostly in Southeast Alaska, but also in the Chugach National Forest near Anchorage. 
Idaho, which has the second-largest amount of roadless Forest Service land, is already exempted from the Roadless Rule, as is Colorado. Idaho and Colorado have state-specific rules that supersede the federal rule.
Montana, the No. 3 roadless state, has more than 6 million acres of roadless forest.
“They are the wildest lands on the National Forest System, de facto wilderness. And the only reason to rescind the Roadless Rule is if you want to undermine the wild character of these lands by invading the wilderness,” Caputo said. 
Rollins, speaking in New Mexico, said she believes that rescinding the rule would allow the Forest Service and other organizations to more efficiently fight fires in national forests and allow timber cutting that could reduce fire danger.
“That’s great news,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, in response to Rollins’ announcement.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it, and if we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve (timber) production,” Cox said.
In Southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is a rainforest and isn’t subject to significant wildfire danger. Rescinding the Roadless Rule there would directly allow new mines and logging.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEThe proposal drew immediate pushback from regional conservationists.
“The Tongass National Forest is our home — it sustains our communities, supports our fisheries, our recreation and tourism economy, provides critical climate change mitigation, and nourishes the deer and salmon we rely on for sustenance,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a written statement. “Opening up more of the Tongass to large-scale, clearcut logging is an existential threat to the authentic values of the forest and our Southeast Alaska ways of life.”
SEACC and a collection of environmental, tourism and tribal groups are currently fighting a lawsuit that seeks to reverse the Roadless Rule in the Tongass.
The lead plaintiff in that suit is the Alaska Forest Association, a logging trade group whose leadership praised the new plan.
“The Alaska Forest Association applauds the Secretary’s decision to repeal the Roadless Rule,” said Tessa Axelson, the association’s director.
“The Rule has contributed to the decline of the timber industry in Southeast Alaska for over twenty years, and more importantly, limited critical access for project development and mining that can and should support rural community needs, decrease energy costs, and power the economy of AK, and the United States,” Axelson said in an email provided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Forest Association in its lawsuit.
“By rescinding the rule, the Secretary is taking a step in the right direction to restore Congress’s intent that our natural resources should be put to productive use and our forests should be actively managed,” she said.
Back in New Mexico, Rollins insinuated that the Roadless Rule repeal is only one of several policy proposals that the Trump administration is planning.
“We are not even six months into what promises to be arguably one of the most transformative administrations of our lifetime,” she said.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)North Carolina senators approved a massive hurricane relief package Monday, thawing out a bill that had been frozen for a month and passing it with major changes.
Senate Republicans’ proposed aid for western North Carolina lays out vastly more money than the bill passed by the House in May — around $2.46 billion in total. And it makes changes to several major line-items in the House version’s, which totaled $464 million.
Among the most notable changes: the removal of a $60 million grant program for small businesses, a longtime request as many storefronts struggle to reopen due to flooding and lost tourism.
In the new bill, $700 million in spending is sent to the state’s Helene recovery fund. Of that money, $465 million is appropriated, leaving the rest for future aid.
The remaining money includes federal funding and money to qualify municipalities for competitive grants, among other purposes, according to Fiscal Research Division staff at the General Assembly. Lawmakers have redirected more than half a billion dollars from local aid, road repairs and other state programs toward Helene relief.
House lawmakers and advocates in the region have for weeks requested that the Senate take up the bill and pass it, as the mountains continue to recover from Helene.
The aid package sat in committee for a month as leaders in the House and Senate negotiated the state budget; they have yet to come to an agreement.
On Monday, they got their wish, as Senate Republicans fast-tracked it through committee and onto the floor. The aid package passed in a unanimous vote.
But the removal of business grants, as well as an array of other differences, will spark frustration — and could lead to even further delay.
“This allows us — on transportation funds, on private roads and bridges — to address some of those issues,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said.
Senate Democrats said they had reservations about the changes to the House’s bill, which received unanimous support. And they were dubious that House Republicans would agree to the Senate’s changes.
“I certainly don’t think the House is going to concur with them, because they haven’t been pre-negotiated with the House,” said Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) in an interview. “They’ve basically admitted that.”
If the bill clears the Senate this week, it will return to the House, who must agree to the changes to send it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk.
Both chambers will debate a flurry of legislation this week in what is widely viewed as a final push before they leave Raleigh for weeks.
Senate Republicans scratch business grants from aid bill. They say it’s a constitutional issue.
Hise, asked by reporters Monday about why the Senate had removed money for small business grants, cited the state’s “emoluments clause.”
The North Carolina constitution declares that “no person … is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of public services.”
Hise argues that includes a grant program, in which the state would select specific businesses to receive money, falls under that umbrella.
“We have not found a way to successfully get around that concept,” Hise said.
He said he planned to bring forward a constitutional amendment on the matter, which would require approval from the legislature and a majority of voters. It’s unclear what that timeline would look like.
Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said in an interview that if Republicans “were that concerned,” they should have discussed the issue with the House “instead of just jettisoning the entire bill.”
“This is literally playing with our western North Carolinian neighbors’ lives and livelihoods and welfare,” Batch said. “Only to get political chips and negotiations while we go into a budget debate.”
Past legal analyses of the state’s emoluments clause have come to different conclusions than Hise.
The North Carolina attorney general’s office under Mike Easley, a Democrat, wrote in a 1999 opinion to legislative leaders that natural disaster grant programs for farmers, homeowners and small businesses would benefit “the public good.”

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land. 
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests. 
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said. 
US Interior Secretary Burgum hypes innovation at WGA, steers clear of public lands controversy

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy. 
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.” 
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests. 
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said. 
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office. 
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation. 
Governors’ report outlines how western states, territories could build more affordable housing

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward. 
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9951-1024x768.png,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

Omaha-based Noddle Companies is developing the 31-acre mixed-use project, which is part of the larger 132-acre Gretna Landing subdivision northwest of 192nd Street and Highway 370.
Gretna Mayor Mike Evans said Monday that the Noddle-led venture is key, as it will create a needed job base in the growing suburban community situated between the cities of Omaha and Lincoln — the developer expects 500 jobs when the site is built out. 
Live, work, play
Poised to rise on the high-density site, said CEO Jay Noddle: an estimated 75,000 square feet of retail space; about 300 apartment and townhome dwellings and about 170,000 square feet of office space, most of which is the health care center.
A highlight, Evans said, will be the open green space for gatherings and events. He likened the project to other Noddle live, work and play developments, including Aksarben Village in midtown Omaha that lure activity, shoppers and people. 
“Open spaces where you can build community — where you can gather, have experiences, where artists can come out and sing or hold events,” Evans said.
Construction is to start later this summer. Additional tenants are to be announced in coming months.
The health center, described as a centerpiece of the Noddle project site, is to span 125,000 square feet and open in the second half of 2027. Expected services include primary care, urgent care, pharmacy, sports medicine and orthopaedics and laboratories, said a Nebraska Medicine statement.

Dr. James Linder, CEO and chairman of Nebraska Medicine, said that as a leading academic health system in the region, Nebraska Medicine is proud to expand its services to the growing Sarpy County area.
“Nebraska Medicine’s public-private structure enables opportunities like this one to give Sarpy County residents access to primary and selected specialty care they need closer to where they live,” Linder said in a statement.
Destinations
Noddle said his development team has been searching for the right opportunity in Gretna for years. He said the Nebraska Medicine center will be a destination, and other places in the general vicinity also are big draws.
Among those, he said, is the huge HyVee store, a youth sports complex and a future cheer facility.
“There are a lot of draws and we’re right in the middle of it,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 00:35:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Himes and CT delegation wait for answers on Iran bombing,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/23/ct-us-bombs-iran-himes-war-powers-resolution/,Himes is expected to introduce a war powers resolution to block U.S. involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel.,"U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, learned about the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran in the same way as many of the public did — through social media.
As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, he said he thought that would warrant some kind of advance notice. Himes is part of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of Senate and House leaders plus relevant committee heads in both parties who get briefed on intelligence matters by the administration.
The top leaders were notified ahead of time, with varying levels of detail. Intelligence Committee staff received a classified briefing on Sunday, the day after the strike.
“I learned about the strike last tonight on Twitter,” Himes told CNN on Sunday. “As a member of the Gang of Eight, you might think for something this consequential, we would be informed of any change in intelligence.”
“Let’s not lose sight of the fact that an offensive attack against a foreign nation is something that the Constitution reserves to the Congress of the United States,” he added.
Himes and Connecticut’s congressional delegation hope to get more answers this week as they returned to Washington Monday following the U.S. strikes, Iran’s retaliatory response and the latest news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Congress will get briefed by the Trump administration Tuesday afternoon from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
And as the state’s delegation questions the constitutionality of the attacks, some members are proposing war powers resolutions to block U.S. involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel. The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war.
Himes, along with U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash., are expected to introduce their own version later Monday, an aide familiar with the effort confirmed. The details and text of the resolution were not immediately available.
That is on top of the resolution that’s already been introduced by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers to “to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” It is a concurrent resolution, which doesn’t require the signature of a president and is not usually considered binding.
The Senate has its own version that U.S. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said could come up for a vote later this week, according to Politico. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., had urged GOP leadership to bring it up for an immediate vote.
Once the Himes resolution is formally introduced, a floor vote in the House is required within 15 days. But under House rules, that doesn’t count pro forma session days that happen during a recess, and Congress will be off for a week for the July 4 holiday. That would push the 15-day window farther into July.
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., poured cold water on war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics.” He argued Democrats haven’t taken umbrage to past Democratic administrations who have taken unilateral military actions in certain circumstances. And he pointed to presidents in both parties who have relied on Article II as giving them that authority.
Since President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire over social media, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., indicated that the bipartisan resolution he introduced “might not be necessary,” according to D.C.-based publication Punchbowl News.
“I don’t think this is an appropriate time for a war powers resolution, and I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson told reporters Monday. “President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now, they’re just up in arms. It’s all politics. This is not a time for politics.”
Tuesday will be the first time all of Congress can get more clarity on what led to U.S. involvement in the Middle East conflict and the bombing of three nuclear facilities. And Connecticut’s members want to know if anything changed from March when Gabbard testified that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”
“I had not seen any intelligence as a member of the Gang of Eight to suggest that Iran had taken the decision to build a weapon,” Himes said on CNN. “I don’t think there’s any intelligence out there that suggests that that’s true.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said he wants to get more insight into the damage assessment and what officials are doing in terms of “risk mitigation” for U.S. forces in the region. His comments on Monday came before news of Iran’s retaliatory strike on a U.S. Air Force base in Qatar — which was intercepted by Qatari air defenses — and Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.
“It certainly appeared that the decision was made by a pretty small group of people. Given what our country has been through, I think it definitely deserved a lot more time and deliberation,” Courtney said in an interview. “The thing about the constitutional question of getting authorization, honestly, I think is that aside from the constitutional balance of powers, check and balances, it also really allows for more analysis and voices to be heard.”
Courtney, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said in the week leading up to the strike when Trump was weighing whether to get involved, the calls to his office were “starting to pick up speed” with concerns over a escalating conflict that could mirror wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where the U.S. was involved for decades.
“I think the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan is really a burning memory for people,” Courtney said earlier Monday. “I think that the appetite for going back into the Middle East with an active military posture is not something that people are supporting, by any stretch.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-bombs-iran-AP.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden is giving new life to a training program for inmates that was shelved recently.
“Being Open for Opportunity means investing in people and believing in second chances,” Rhoden said in a statement Monday, referencing a slogan he often uses to promote economic development.
The program will bring on-site instruction to the state penitentiary so inmates can earn a certificate to work on diesel heavy equipment.
Inmate training program shelved while prison construction talks continue

Last August, the Department of Corrections and Southeast Technical College got approval from the state Board of Technical Education to expand the college’s diesel program to the penitentiary.
Officials later decided to shelve the initiative due to a lack of funding and concerns over how it would fit into the still-developing plans for construction of a new men’s prison at an undetermined site. 
Rhoden announced Monday that he will provide $1.5 million for the training program from the Future Fund, a pot of economic development money under the exclusive control of the governor.
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko praised the program’s reinstatement.
“Education is one of the best ways to support rehabilitation and reduce recidivism,” Wasko said in a statement. “These programs give people purpose, build skills, and strengthen families and communities across South Dakota.”
The diesel training program will fill a void left by Metal Craft Industries, a privately operated prison shop that employed inmates at market wages. The company said it was pushed out of the prison system last year by administrators. Wasko has said the company left voluntarily to avoid adhering to newer, stricter security protocols. 
The Future Fund, which Rhoden is tapping to provide money for the training program, is supported by a surcharge on employer payroll taxes. State law says the fund is for “purposes related to research and economic development for the state.”
Some of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s uses of the fund were controversial. That included money to build a state-owned shooting range that the Legislature refused to fund, a workforce recruitment ad campaign starring Noem, a “Governor’s Cup” rodeo that included Noem carrying in the American flag on horseback, and a fireworks display at Mount Rushmore.

,California,2025-06-24 00:11:44+00:00,CalMatters,State workers get a reprieve from Newsom’s return-to-office mandate,Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/return-to-office-pecg/,Gov. Gavin Newsom in May announced that he wanted state workers in the office four days a week. One union negotiated a pause on that policy.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom in May announced that he wanted state workers in the office four days a week. One union negotiated a pause on that policy. 



Gov. Gavin Newsom is open to giving California public employees a temporary break on his return-to-office mandate.
The union representing about 14,000 state engineers today announced a deal that would delay Newsom’s order that they return to work four days a week for one year. It was supposed to take effect July 1.
The Professional Engineers in California Government disclosed that agreement alongside a new contract that includes some concessions Newsom wanted to trim payroll expenses as he tries to shore up a $12 billion budget deficit.
Workers represented by the union will get a 3% raise next week, but it will be offset by mandatory unpaid time off that would basically negate the pay increase for two years. Additional raises will take effect in 2027. That’s similar to the terms of a deal Newsom made last week with the union representing state prison guards.
“The package includes two pay raises and an immediate halt to the four-day return-to-office order for our members. In this budget environment, those are important achievements,” union executive director Ted Toppin said in a written statement.
Governors often grant similar perks to different labor organizations, and that history suggests many other state workers could get a one-year reprieve from the full return-to-office mandate.
Newsom embraced telework policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and unions negotiated work-from-home stipends for public employees. Many of them felt they were as productive as ever, and they were happy to avoid expensive transportation and parking costs.
Newsom brought public employees back to the office twice a week last year, and ordered a bigger move to four-days-a-week in May.
As of May, about 108,000 state employees worked from home at least one day a week, the state human resources director told lawmakers at a recent hearing. 
The engineers union was one of several that contested Newsom’s mandate, including filing a lawsuit against the governor in Sacramento Superior Court. The union agreed to drop the lawsuit in its new agreement with Newsom.
Lawmakers have taken unions’ side, writing a letter earlier this month that urged Newsom to push back the mandate and grilling Newsom’s representatives in May over what they considered to be thin details on what the change would cost and how it would be implemented. 
“This is pretty bewildering,” Democratic Assemblyman Matt Haney of San Francisco said at the May hearing. “So is this, is this supposed to go into effect for everyone on July 1st and that everybody would be expected to come back four days on that day?”
Contracts for five more public employee unions are scheduled to expire next week. The largest labor organization in state government, Service Employees International Union Local 1000, announced that it filed a legal challenge over the return to office mandate last week. It represents about 100,000 workers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/072219-Oakland-Traffic-AW-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 20:59:36.265630

Filed earlier this month by the Montana Family Foundation, the lawsuit alleges the full text of the amendment should have been printed on the ballot instead of just a summary of the proposed Constitutional amendment.
It alleges that voters who registered on Election Day were particularly harmed because they don’t receive the voter guide distributed in advance by the Montana Secretary of State’s Office — which includes the “complete text” of any Constitutional amendment.
In November 2024, Montana voters supported CI-128 to enshrine abortion into the Montana Constitution with 58% approval. The amendment also prevents the government from penalizing patients or providers.
But plaintiffs Hannah Rhodes and Joe Addy, who registered to vote on Election Day, and the Montana Life Defense Fund, are asking the Montana Supreme Court declare the outcome null and void, alleging the submission of CI-128 to voters was “constitutionally deficient (and) procedurally unsound.”
The Montana Family Foundation filed the case on June 9 directly with the Montana Supreme Court and asked it to accept jurisdiction given “urgency factors,” with the amendment to be enacted July 1.
“Make no mistake: This is a battle for the soul of Montana,” the Family Foundation said in an email to supporters. “If CI-128 stands, it will open the floodgates to unrestricted abortion and strip Montana of its ability to protect innocent life.”
The language of the initiative prohibits the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion “before fetal viability.”
The lawsuit was filed against the State of Montana, and last week, Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen filed a notice on behalf of the state agreeing the state Supreme Court should take up the case, which he argued “presents issues of statewide importance.”
However, supporters of CI-128 requested to intervene in the case, arguing no one else in the case will represent their interests.
“The State of Montana forced proponents to litigate at every turn to protect Montanans’ constitutional initiative power,” they said in court documents.
The proposed intervenors are Dr. Samuel Dickman, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, ACLU of Montana, and Forward Montana. They are represented by the Graybill Law Firm and ACLU of Montana.
“Proponents have an incontrovertible interest in defending the validity of CI-128 against Petitioner’s claims,” the group wrote in court documents. “Proponents drafted the petition, collected the signatures, prepared the ballot statement, and advocated for passage of the initiative.
“If this action were ‘dispos(ed) of’ in Petitioner’s favor, it would undo all of Proponents’ work, effectively reversing the results not only of the pre-election litigation but also a statewide election.”
This week in a court filing, the Montana Family Foundation said it did not object to participation by the intervenors given the position of the state, and it suggested “substantive briefing” could be helpful in the case.
It said the Montana Constitution requires “the full text of any proposed constitutional amendment to be submitted to the qualified electors on the ballot — not merely a short title, explanatory summary, or attorney general’s statement.”
The Montana Secretary of State publishes a voter information pamphlet, including the complete text of any Constitutional amendment, but that booklet is only distributed to registered voters on an active voter list “not later than 45 days before the election,” said the Montana Family Foundation in its petition.
That means Election-Day registrants don’t get those pamphlets, the plaintiffs said: “In other words, this class of qualified electors are deprived of the same opportunities to cast more-informed ballots compared to registered, active voters who appear on a county’s voter registration list more than 45 days prior to the election.”
As such, the Montana Family Foundation said the failure to include the full text of the amendment on the ballot violates the equal protection clause of the state and U.S. constitutions.
“As an Election-Day registrant, Rhodes was forced to cast a ballot without having an opportunity to read, evaluate or analyze the full text of CI-128,” said the court filing.
In a joint statement, supporters of CI-128 who asked to intervene in the case said they would continue to fight for access to abortion.
The statement was issued by ACLU of Montana Executive Director Akilah Deernose, Forward Montana Executive Director Alice Boyer, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana CEO and President Martha Fuller.
“Everyone deserves the privacy and compassion to access the abortion care they need,” they said. “Montana voters agreed and made an informed decision when they decisively enshrined their right to abortion in the State Constitution.
“Anti-abortion extremists are showing a desperate display in an attempt to outright ignore the will of Montanans to enforce their unpopular, dangerous political agenda. We know that they will try anything to ban abortion — we, alongside our supporters, remain committed to fighting for Montanans and their families, and medical privacy free from government interference.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)As state-level elected officials met with cabinet secretaries appointed by Donald Trump at the Western Governors Association’s annual meeting on Monday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators protested outside, their chants of “not for sale” echoing through downtown Santa Fe.
A coalition of hunters, fishers, mountain bikers, rock climbers, skiers, hikers, campers, wildlife lovers and more marched to the conference venue from nearby DeVargas Park, where the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance hosted a rally to oppose a Republican tax and spend proposal that would make more than 21,000 square miles of public land in New Mexico “eligible” to be sold to private buyers, according to a recent analysis.
New Mexico State Police unsuccessfully tried to stop the crowd from completely blocking West San Francisco Street and the entrance to El Dorado Hotel, where U.S. cabinet secretaries and state and territorial governors were gathered. Earlier in the day, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had given a keynote address to conference attendees, with no mention of the GOP proposal.
“This land is sacred, this land belongs to all of us, the water belongs to all of us,” Santa Clara Pueblo Gov. James Naranjo said at the rally. “They don’t belong to rich millionaires, they belong to the people of New Mexico and our visitors that come a long way to see our beautiful state, our beautiful culture, our beautiful ways of life.”
Speakers at the rally also opposed the Trump administration’s review of national monument protections, including buffer zones around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
“Please support us tribes,” Naranjo told the crowd. “We’re fighting for Chaco Canyon, we’re fighting for Bears Ears, Tent Rocks, Puye Cliffs, Bandelier, Valles Caldera. All our national parks are in jeopardy.”

Teresa Martinez, executive director and co-founder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, said when people stand up for the land, they also stand up for each other. She said 100 years from now, future generations need to know that the right people stood up at the right time to protect cherished natural landscapes.
“Because if we don’t do it, the wrong people will,” she said, gesturing to the hotel where the governors were meeting with Trump officials. “The people in that room are the wrong people, and they’re trying to do it right now.”
Lauren Leib, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Local 340, which represents federal Bureau of Land Management workers in New Mexico, called on all of the state and federal officials at the conference to stop the tax and spending legislation going through Congress called the “one big beautiful bill.”
“They’re using this rationale to propose selling off millions of acres of our public lands to offset the massive tax breaks for the 1%, and they’re doing that under the guise of creating affordable housing,” Leib said. “That’s now how you solve the housing crisis.”
Instead, she said, policymakers should enact rent control, living wages and regulations of the rich who can afford to buy up housing.
“They’re trying to steal your public lands to line their own pockets out of insatiable greed, and utter disdain for working class people like you and me,” she said.
Also during the rally, more than 100 nonprofit organizations delivered a letter to the 19 state leaders at the WGA conference, urging them to oppose the federal legislation. The letter warned that the proposal would allow an unprecedented disposal of public lands “with no environmental review, meaningful Tribal consultation, or public input.”
“It will take effect with lightning speed, forcing the immediate nomination of lands put up for auction within 30 days, all with no public process,” the letter states. “There are no requirements or safeguards that sold land be used for affordable housing. It’s an attack on the very values Westerners hold dear.”
Naranjo placed the struggle over public lands in the context of his people’s struggles against colonialism.
“We fought off the Spaniards. We fought off the U.S. government,” he said. “We fought off a lot of people in our day, my ancestors, and we’re still here.”

Free.,'None of us are tired': Democratic AGs pledge extended court fight against Trump,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/none-us-are-tired-democratic-ags-pledge-extended-court-fight-against-trump,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic state attorneys general vowed Monday on Capitol Hill to continue legal challenges against President Donald Trump’s “outrageous overreach” through executive orders to strip birthright citizenship, impose staggering global tariffs, thwart lifesaving medical research and more.Attorneys General Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Matthew J. Platkin of New Jersey, Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts and Kwame Raoul of Illinois spoke before Democrats on both the Senate and House Judiciary committees during a special “spotlight forum” hosted by minority party lawmakers.The top state law enforcement officers and their other blue state counterparts have mounted legal challenges against Trump’s directives they argue threaten their states’ economies and deprive constituents of their rights.The lawmakers have racked up wins in the federal courts to reinstate the jobs of fired federal workers, restore congressionally appropriated funding for health initiatives and nonprofits and protect citizenship for babies born in the United States to all parents, including immigrants.Trump, his administration officials and rank-and-file Republicans have attacked federal district judges on social media for rulings they didn’t like, and are mulling legislative action to yank power from the judiciary.“We’ve been punching above our weight and playing a vital role in this moment,” Campbell said.More than 20 Democratic state AGs are now awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion on whether it will uphold the states’ lower court victories protecting birthright citizenship.30 lawsuitsRep. Jamie Raskin, top Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, praised the AGs for their role among the hundreds of lawsuits challenging Trump’s unilateral actions.The administration is facing 328 lawsuits from any number of plaintiffs, and at least 30 from Democratic state AGs, according to Raskin’s count. Numerous trackers online keep pace with the latest developments in the dozens upon dozens of cases launched since Trump began his second term.“Federal courts across the land have remarkably issued 197 preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders against this reign of lawlessness,” Raskin, of Maryland, said.Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, blamed Trump’s executive orders for “having damaging effects on the rights, liberties and pocketbooks of everybody.”“In this disturbing environment, many Americans have no greater ally than their states’ attorneys general,” said Durbin, of Illinois.Those on the panel told the lawmakers that standing up for Congress has been “at the core” of many of their legal challenges.“When we say he can't act like a king, it means he can't take actions that you have done and (were) signed into law by a president, and decide on a whim that he wants to, say, convert a Department of Transportation highway program into an immigration enforcement program,” Platkin said, referring to a June 19 victory for 20 Democratic-led states whose federal transit dollars were threatened.  Ellison said Trump’s orders that threaten states’ federal funding are “bullying, plain and simple.”“We will endure. This committee can count on state AGs, the ones who believe in liberty and justice for all, to continue to fight. None of us are tired, and we can do this longer than they can do this,” Ellison said.Medical research hitFor roughly two-and-a-half hours, Democratic lawmakers discussed the ways their constituents could be or have been harmed by Trump’s record number of executive orders since Jan. 20.Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania thanked the AGs for “working on behalf of all Americans to hold this administration accountable.”Scanlon, who represents the Philadelphia area, said her district was particularly impacted by Trump’s order to pull federal medical research dollars, including widespread funding from the National Institutes of Health.“My constituents are reporting a whole range of negative consequences. … Participants are being told they can no longer receive the treatment, that for many, was their last best hope. Accomplished research personnel are being laid off, threatening their livelihoods, and kneecapping our medical sector's ability to innovate,” Scanlon said.Rep. Deborah Ross, whose district includes North Carolina’s “Research Triangle” — the location of three major research universities in Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill — thanked Campbell for her role in a legal victory to restore NIH funding.Ross recalled a woman in her district reaching out to her office asking when a medical study she was part of would begin again.“When you guys get these amazing injunctions, you have to show both that the Trump administration has violated the law, likelihood of success on the merits, and you have to show irreparable harm. And just this woman who I got a message from is a demonstration of this irreparable harm,” Ross said.Illinois state Attorney General Raoul lamented that his GOP counterparts have not joined the lawsuits, particularly on health funding. Raoul told the panel that his father, a doctor, had died of prostate cancer. Years later, Raoul received a similar diagnosis but survived.“We should continue to advance in research. When we decided to take action on this, it's a very personal one to me,” Raoul said.“This does not just impact us in blue states, right? There are research institutions in the red states that are impacted as well. I would wish, I beg upon my colleagues who serve as AGs on the other side of the aisle to join us in this fight, because their institutions would otherwise suffer as well.”",,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)In the Georgia political world, reaction to U.S. military attacks against three nuclear sites in Iran fell mostly, but not entirely, along party lines.
President Donald Trump announced the strikes Saturday night, calling them “a spectacular military success.”
The intervention into the war between Iran and Israel stoked fear of reprisal against U.S. military bases in the Middle East or terrorist attacks at home, but Trump and his allies said the strikes will prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
On Monday, Iran launched a retaliatory missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar. Initial reports said U.S. air defenses intercepted the missiles and no casualties were reported.
Georgia GOP mostly backs strikes
  Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Gov. Brian Kemp praised the U.S. bombings in an online post.
“America can never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Thank you to President Trump, our service members and intelligence personnel, and administration officials who conducted this successful operation.”
Kemp later added that he and other governors around the country are in communication with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to discuss threats of retaliation.
“We are coordinating with law enforcement on all levels as we closely monitor any possible threats,” Kemp said.
In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified before a congressional committee that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”
Another U.S. assessment found that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon and that, if they started making one, it would take them up to three years to complete it, according to CNN.
Most of Georgia’s Republican representatives in Congress followed the same formula: thanking Trump, thanking the troops and stating that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.
The exception was Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Rome. In a series of posts, Greene characterized the attacks as representing a return to the GOP’s neoconservative wing and its support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and away from Trump’s campaign promises of avoiding expensive and deadly foreign entanglements.
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said. “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if (Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin) Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first. Israel is a nuclear armed nation. This is not our fight. Peace is the answer.”
Greene’s take puts her at odds with the majority of her party, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.
“She’s maybe still stuck on that page where Trump supporters and Trump himself were not in favor of regime change, certainly, and wanting to concentrate on making America great again, not worrying about what’s happening in the rest of the world,” he said. “So she is still in that mode, it sounds like, while Trump has moved on, and for most Republicans, if Trump moves on, they move on with him.”
Bullock said Greene’s anti-war statements are not likely to hurt her in the ruby red northwest Georgia district or damage her relationship with Trump, but if the U.S. does become engaged in a major war, Georgia Republicans could have to answer for their support.
“A year from now, as we’re looking at the 2026 election, if the U.S. is an active participant – certainly if we have troops on the ground who are in harm’s way – that does make this an issue that Republicans are going to have to defend themselves on, where up until this point, they’ve been pretty consistent in indicating that they would not want to see the U.S. become involved in somebody else’s war,” Bullock said
The Georgia House of Representatives issued a resolution Monday praising Trump, Israel and the strikes in Iran, as well as honoring Georgians who have died in conflicts in the Middle East. A total of 100 lawmakers signed the resolution, including nearly all Republicans and one Democrat, state Rep. Esther Panitch of Sandy Springs.
Democrats mostly oppose strikes
Georgia Democrats characterized the attacks as reckless and argued Trump should have sought congressional approval before approving them.
The Constitution grants Congress the authority to declare war, but presidents from both parties have deployed troops without formal declarations of war.
Sen. Raphael Warnock invoked the specter of the Iraq War.
“President Trump, who has said he ‘might or might not’ bomb Iran and has indicated this week that he disagrees with the assessment of his own national intelligence advisers, has now entered another Middle East conflict,” Warnock said. “He has not sought congressional approval and has not sufficiently explained why this operation was necessary right now. With thousands of American troops at risk for potential retaliation, this is not ‘the art of the deal.’ This is war. And this is not the first time the American people have been told that it will end quickly.”
  Rep. Esther Panitch. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year, was measured in his response, which was only two sentences.
“I pray for the safety of U.S. military servicemembers deployed around the world and express my admiration for their courage and professionalism,” Ossoff said in a statement following the strikes. “Congress must be promptly and fully briefed on tonight’s operation and consulted on the Administration’s strategy.”
Panitch, the state’s only currently serving Jewish legislator and a staunch supporter of Israel, celebrated the bombings on social media, arguing that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a danger to the Jewish state.
“When someone tells you they want you dead, have acted on it over the last 40 years, and have the ingredients to do it, you don’t wait until the warhead has been launched to protect yourself,” she said in a post.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum acknowledged the importance of public land in the west during remarks to the Western Governors’ Association on Monday, but did not address the prospect of 250 million acres of Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land becoming eligible for sale under the proposed federal budget making its way through Congress.
GOP bill makes 14 million acres of public land in NM ‘eligible’ for sale, according to new analysis

Nor did any of the western governors ask him about the Congressional Republican proposal when Burgum took their questions. The secretary did not take questions from the media and, as of publication, press availability with him had not been announced.
Originally scheduled to speak later in the day, Burgum instead swapped places with Education Secretary Linda McMahon. A protest against the sale of public lands timed to Burgum’s original speaking time proceeded as planned.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Democratic candidate in New Mexico’s 2026 governor’s race, released a statement Monday denouncing the GOP proposal and said Burgum “should answer to New Mexicans while he visits our state and explain why he prioritizes corporate greed over New Mexico’s wellbeing.”
In his remarks, Burgum, a former governor of North Dakota, noted his belief that “the only people that should ever be head of Interior are people who’ve already been a western governor,” and noted that states such as New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming—to name a few—“are more than geographic destinations.” They aren’t “snow globes,” he said. “One of my messages here to all of you today is one of abundance…you can have amazing national parks, national historic sites, national monuments, you can work collaboratively with the tribes…and you can still contribute mightily to the nation’s economy and the nation’s security.”
Burgum returned to the theme of “abundance” in remarks about energy and what he characterized as the United States’ over-dependence on China for “critical minerals.” That “lopsided” dependence, he said, works against environmental concerns, contending that “if you care about the environment, do it in the U.S., because we do this stuff cleaner, smarter and safer than anyone. So, energy dominance is about us…having affordable energy to power all Americans.” Having “low-cost, affordable reliable energy,” he continued “drives everything home…because it keeps inflation down for every single production. There isn’t a product you wear, there isn’t a product that you eat, there isn’t a product that you drive, there isn’t a home that you live in that doesn’t have an energy component already in it.”

President Donald Trump upon taking office issued an executive order prioritizing mineral mining on federal lands and opening the door to rescinding existing bans.
While WGA emphasizes the bipartisan nature of its organization, Burgum alluded to outside tensions, arguing that “part of the divisiveness in our country is getting people to believe that everything is scarce, and if we do A, then we can’t do B, or if we do B, we can’t do A. We just have to get an abundance mindset, and we have to understand that innovation will solve any problem that we have.”
Specifically, he homed in on artificial intelligence, which he said is “going to change every job, every company and every industry. It would be impossible for me to overhype this in any possible way.”
Technological advances “extends human capability” such that “we’re at this tipping point where we now have the ability to actually solve all of our problems and stop living in a world where everything is a trade-off.”
But this vision can only come to pass if America has enough energy, Burgum said, and at present “our grid is at great risk.” Rolling blackouts and rolling brownouts during peak summer and peak winter are possible, he said, not because of climate change or the environment, but because you “can’t run a grid if the majority of your energy source is intermittent.” For instance: “The sun goes down at night,” thus, “there’s no solar production at night in this country.”
On the other hand, he said, in about 10 years, “the advancements coming in nuclear will produce clean energy in unlimited forms.” Burgum noted four executive orders Trump signed in May aimed at expediting approval of nuclear reactors, among other goals.
Hence, he said “the existential threat that we are facing is not one or two degrees of climate change in 2100, because we’ll solve all that… in the next decade or two by the innovation that will be provided if we can cut the red tape and have enough energy to drive AI and have enough energy to sell to our friends and allies, so they can stop buying from our adversaries.”
Outgoing WGA Chair New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently announced a $1 billion geothermal plant in the state and attended an energy summit in Alaska. In her question to Burgum about the role western states can play, she noted that New Mexico “continues to have huge opportunities for energy production, everything from fossil fuels to small-scale nuclear.” Western governors want to “help demonstrate” the ability to deploy “effective clean energy across the spectrum.”
Burgum noted that the strategy in New Mexico and other Western states is one of “energy abundance” and an “understanding it’s not an energy transition.”
New Mexico does, in fact, have an Energy Transition Act that sets zero-carbon goals for the coming decades.
“There is no transition,” Burgum continued. “It’s energy addition. We need everything we have, and then we need a lot more of it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DougBurgum-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Witness testimony began in Denver District Court on Monday in a whistleblower lawsuit over whether Gov. Jared Polis broke state law by ordering state employees to produce information for a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena.
During that testimony, a state official said that Polis’ office has not provided assurances to the state’s Department of Labor and Employment that it will investigate how federal authorities intend to use the requested data — for the child welfare purposes laid out in the subpoena or for immigration enforcement such as deportation.
Scott Moss, director of the state Division of Labor Standards and Statistics in CDLE, sued Polis, a Democrat, earlier this month over the governor’s direction to comply with the ICE subpoena. It sought personal information about people who house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children, known as sponsors. Sponsors are often family members who care for the children while they await deportation proceedings.

The April subpoena sought employer information, unemployment filings and Family and Medical Leave Insurance program records from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment about 35 sponsors, with the stated goal of ensuring the children were properly cared for and weren’t being exploited.
The governor’s office decided in late May that it wanted CDLE to produce and deliver the information.
CDLE director Joe Barela testified he was not aware of any specific criminal investigation tied to the information sought by the ICE subpoena or evidence of children in danger.
“I don’t think there was evidence. I think that if there possibly could be a chance that these sponsors had children in their care that weren’t accounted for or could possibly be exploited or involved in trafficking, that we didn’t want to prevent an investigation from finding that out,” he said.
But Moss alleges that disclosure of that type of personal identifying information violates a 2021 state law that generally prohibits state employees from sharing personal identifying information for federal immigration enforcement unless it is part of a criminal investigation. That law was updated and expanded this year. It passed the Legislature and was signed into law as exchanges over the subpoena played out in the background.
The subpoena uses the language “criminal purposes” and is labeled as an “immigration enforcement subpoena.”
“That should have been rationale enough to stop and ask questions,” said Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the 2021 and 2025 bills.
Polis’ lawyers contend that the subpoena was specific and pertained to potential human trafficking and a related criminal investigation, not immigration enforcement.
“Am I going to believe you or my own lying eyes? When I read that, it doesn’t say it’s for the purpose of a criminal investigation. This is posited as a welfare check,” District Judge A. Bruce Jones said in a back and forth with Polis attorney Thomas Rogers III.
Barela outlined a meeting in late May between him, members of the governor’s office and members of the attorney general’s office to deliberate whether to comply with the subpoena. He said the consensus following that meeting was that they would not be in violation of the 2021 state law if they handed over the requested information.
“I do think people were still uncertain, but I think they were reassured after that meeting that there was the attorney general and governor’s office supporting (us) and we were aligned in doing our job,” he said.
Polis’ lawyers have argued that Moss, as well as the two labor unions and nonprofit that have joined the lawsuit, does not have legal standing, because Moss did not have to comply with the order to produce the requested data and wouldn’t have faced repercussions. Barela testified that he could be the one to ask CDLE staff to get the information and that his conversations with Moss over legal concerns were in pursuit of a solution to run the 35 names through the department database.
“It’s very difficult to say ‘No’ when your direct supervisor, who is in charge of your hiring, firing and performance evaluations, asks you to do something. It’s a very intimidating environment, and we see employees retaliated against in a variety of ways,” said Diane Byrne, president of Colorado WINS, the union representing over 27,000 state workers.
Testimony will continue on Tuesday afternoon. Jones will then decide whether to block Polis’ directive to comply with the ICE subpoena.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general in support of two lawsuits filed in May by National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) against President Donald Trump. 
The lawsuits challenge Trump’s May 1 executive order which targets “taxpayer subsidization of biased media” and argues that public funding of these media outlets is “not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.” 
Neronha and the attorneys general have a different take.
“Public media is a public good,” states the 41-page amicus brief filed Friday. “That good is even more valuable at the local level, where newsworthiness, reach, and financial incentives often do not align.”
“NPR and PBS are American institutions responsible for delivering emergency information, educational programming, and reliable news, all of which Americans use to inform how they live their lives,” Neronha said in a Friday statement. “These massive cuts would have dramatically negative impacts on the flow of public information, especially in rural and tribal areas, with potentially life-threatening consequences.”
Trump’s directive would terminate both direct and indirect federal funds for NPR and PBS, and “cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law,” according to the order text. 
The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and all other federal agencies to cancel grants and any other lingering financial support by June 30. The order argues that the Corporation has failed to abide by federal law by subsidizing the national networks and their affiliates, which Trump claims do not meet a standard of “fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”
The two lawsuits challenging Trump’s order were filed separately, with the first arriving on May 27 from NPR and three Colorado public radio stations — including the tribal-serving KSUT. The second lawsuit came on May 30 and was filed by PBS and a Minnesota affiliate. Both lawsuits argue that the threatened funding exceeds presidential authority, and erodes the information infrastructure needed for emergency alerts and local news.
The amicus brief filed Friday is co-led by the attorneys general of Colorado, Arizona, and Minnesota, plus Neronha. An additional attorneys general from 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, signed the brief. 
The brief details how emergency notification systems often rely on public broadcasters as primary or secondary venues to deliver emergency messages, Amber Alerts for abducted children, Silver Alerts for older people or people with disabilities who are missing, and other kinds of notifications. The broadcasters’ infrastructure can also serve as backups for notifications about electrical and internet outages, as they “often have hardened and resilient infrastructure that allows them to continue broadcasting during emergency situations,” the brief states.
The brief also argues for public media as an essential educational resource and lifeline for rural and underserved communities who may lack reliable access to broadband internet or non-free news sources. 
“Public media connects millions of Americans,” the brief reads. “It touches life’s ordinary and extraordinary moments, from school lessons in the living room to life-saving emergency alerts in the midst of a storm. … Losing public media would erode that trust and leave many American communities in the dark.”
Joining the four co-leading states and the District of Columbia are attorneys general from the states of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

(Photo courtesy of National Weather Service-Bismarck)A severe weekend storm that claimed three lives also caused devastating damage to North Dakota’s agriculture industry.
Total damage is still being assessed from the widespread storm, which included a tornado near Enderlin that killed residents Michael Dalton Dehn, 73, Katherine Ann Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Machuca Lucio, 89.
On Monday, officials were learning more about the impact of multiple tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds, with gusts reported to the National Weather Service exceeding 100 mph.
“It went all the way from southwest of Dickinson and just rolled across the state in different areas where supercells popped up,” North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said. “And it may not have been continuous, but it was continuous enough.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong declared the storms a statewide disaster on Saturday, activating the state’s emergency plan. He plans to tour the damage in eastern North Dakota this week.
Goehring said the total damage is still being assessed, but his office has received reports of extensive damage to farms including grain handling systems, grain bins, equipment and irrigation systems. He estimates the loss of grain storage to be tens of millions of bushels.
“The one thing I know with certainty is the amount of damage that was done to grain handling systems and just all of that is just tremendous,” Goehring said. “So many bins that were collapsed.”
He said he’s also heard reports of people losing cattle, livestock buildings and corrals.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Much of the damage was caused by severe straight-line winds. Goehring said he talked to a spray pilot over the weekend who lost his hangar and found his plane about a quarter-mile away.
“He said the turbine, that’s a $500,000 motor,” Goehring said. “So these guys are experiencing some real significant losses.”
Damage to agriculture facilities or equipment should be reported through the North Dakota State University Extension System, Goehring said.
Lilly Bina, North Dakota State University Extension agent in Cass County, visited Enderlin and Page on Monday to make a record of the damage. Bina said she saw a lot of crushed bins and sheds, torn up trees and shredded fields.
“The crop is not looking very good,” she said.
A grain elevator in Page was mostly destroyed, she added.
“Hopefully there’s some government programs that can help everyone,” she said.
Goehring said the North Dakota Industrial Commission may be able to provide some relief while the state continues to tally up the damage with hopes that federal resources could become available. 
The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services is working with city, county and tribal emergency managers and rural electric cooperatives to assess the extent of the damage. As of Monday, the department did not have information about how many homes were affected.
More than 36,000 customers lost power during the storm, with about 3,250 still without power on Monday, the Department of Emergency Services said.
The American Red Cross was providing community support and planned to serve dinner in Page Monday night, Sue Thesenga, regional communications manager for the nonprofit.
She said multiple families have reached out for temporary housing and financial assistance. Assistance is available calling 1-800-RED-CROSS or visiting the Red Cross website.
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.
Local communities have also established fundraisers, including the Dakota Plains Credit Union in Enderlin, which will host a freewill donation meal and fundraiser on Tuesday evening.
Tina Bleecker, branch manager for the credit union, said her sister’s farm was hit by the storm and while the family remained safe, they lost several cattle and livestock buildings .
“Walking through their yard was like a movie. It was traumatizing.” Bleecker said. “It’s certainly a sight to behold around here with all the damage.”

Attorneys, led by both the state and national American Civil Liberties Union, were successful in challenging Senate Bill 99 as unconstitutional. Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks found that the measure violated the constitutional rights including equal protection, freedom of speech and the right to privacy. A team of attorneys from across the nation successfully challenged the law, which was struck down and allows medical providers to still offer gender-affirming care to residents less than the age of 18.
Attorneys said they vindicated — or successfully challenged — the constitutional rights of their clients and other state residents, and should get attorneys fees under the “private attorney general” doctrine which says that parties which have to defend basic rights are entitled to attorneys fees when the state refuses to defend them.
“This litigation did not merely vindicate abstract constitutional rights — it immediately and effectively voided a statute that threatened the rights of some of Montana’s most vulnerable residents,” the court documents said.
Court documents, like those filed by the ACLU of Montana on Friday, also give a look at the time, effort and tactics used by both sides. In its court filing, the ACLU alleges that the court case was especially time consuming because of attempts by the Montana Attorney General’s Office to delay or slow the case, including making untimely motions, sending disorganized documents, or trying to include other third parties.
The Daily Montanan reached out to the Montana Attorney General Office’s with an opportunity to comment or offer its explanation, but officials did not respond to requests on Monday.
The attorneys fees include $1.3 million, plus an additional $86,523 in costs.
Marks had said in his ruling that the state failed on several different aspects of the case.
“The Legislature disregarded its constitutional limitations, and the Attorney General offered no substantive or constitutional interest in defense of these actions,” Marks said.
The ACLU and the plaintiffs said that because the Legislature, the Attorney General and the governor all agreed on the topic, it left the plaintiffs to stand up for themselves.
“Private enforcement (was) the only option for plaintiffs to protect their rights,” the new court filings said. “Without this lawsuit, SB 99 would have remained in effect despite its unconstitutionality.”
The new court documents also paint a picture of the state attorneys as either disorganized or meritless. For example, it opposed admitting out-of-state attorneys — something that is common practice — which ultimately slowed the case and caused additional attorney time justifying why Marks should allow several attorneys to work on the case while in Montana courts.
“The state elected to combine different types of discovery — interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission — within each set in a disorganized manner, with no apparent logical order,” the ACLU said.
They argue that the additional disorganization and procedural fights were tactics to delay the case, but also run up the attorney bills. The attorneys who originally signed on agreed to take the case pro bono.
The attorneys who worked on the case for the plaintiffs show rates varying from $350 to $500 per hour, which they said is reasonable for Montana work, and then offered a comparison when the Attorney General’s Office paid a $500,000 retainer to a Washington, D.C., law firm to defend a challenge to another Legislature-passed bill regarding the popular social media application, TikTok. Attorneys hired by the state were contracted at between $650 and $700 per hour.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Gov. Greg Gianforte last week finalized the largest portion of Montana’s biennial budget by signing House Bill 2, but he removed tens of millions of dollars citing concerns over spending.
The line-item vetoes — a power most governors have to remove specific items from spending bills — cut nearly $31 million from the more than $16.6 billion budget. In addition, the governor’s office announced six more individual bills Gianforte vetoed last week totaling another more than $22 million. 
“Montana taxpayers work hard for what they earn, and they expect us to be good stewards of the taxes they pay to fund state government, protecting them from unnecessary spending,” Gianforte wrote in his June 20 veto letter for House Bill 2, the omnibus spending bill that will fund the state for the next two years. “They’ve been at the front of my mind when considering the measures the Legislature passed and sent to me. They’re at the front of my mind again as I consider the budget.”
The governor’s vetoes mostly focused on new and expanded funding for educational, correctional and health-related services. 
Gianforte said the budget the Legislature passed — in a bipartisan but controversial manner, with all Democrats joining moderate Republicans in support — wasn’t as fiscally responsible as the one he proposed back in November, though the total price tag was similar. The budget represented a 2% increase over the previous biennium, though conservative Republicans decried it as a bloated “big government” budget.
An analysis of the final budget by the Legislative Fiscal Division on June 7 — before Gianforte’s final vetoes — indicated the state’s revenue and spending are in alignment for the next two years, but showed that expenditures will exceed revenues in 2028 and beyond. 
The future imbalance, which was expected to be much worse under earlier analyses prior to the governor vetoing individual pieces of legislation, led many conservative Republicans to vote against the budget bill, calling the spending spree “not sustainable.”
On the other side, Democratic leaders in the House denounced several of the governor’s final cuts for harming Montana families, such as a revenue stream for nonprofits that work with low-income families with children and a student loan repayment play for state nurses.  
“I’m really disappointed in the Governor’s line-item vetoes of HB 2. House Democrats worked hard this session to secure investments in making life more affordable for Montanans, but these are the items that Gianforte put on the chopping block,” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a statement. “Montana’s budget is a statement of our values, and with these cuts, Governor Gianforte is telling us loud and clear that his priorities are not with working families.”
Gianforte added that while the Legislature passed a balanced budget, it included unnecessary spending that he removed. 
Three line items GIanforte struck out were agency funding measures that he said officials indicated they did not need. He removed $346,557 from the Legislative Branch, $1.126,412 from the Department of Revenue’ Cannabis Control Division, and $29,702 from the Department of Commerce’s travel expense reimbursement fund. 
House Bill 2, as passed, contained funding for two individual measures Gianforte vetoed. House Bill 462 provided a $5 million investment to revise mathematics content standards that, according to the governor, the superintendent of public instruction said was unnecessary. He vetoed that measure, brought by Rep. Melissa Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls, in May. 
He also removed a line item that funded House Bill 551, providing $600,000 for school lunch funding to eliminate copayments for reduced-price school meals.
HB 2 created a $3 million student loan repayment program for nurses, licensed practical nurses and psychiatrists who work at state-run facilities, including the Montana State Hospital. Gianforte said that while the goal of the program to help recruit and retain behavioral health workers was a critical one, the prioritization of workers at the State Hospital was unnecessary. He also wrote in his veto letter that the Department of Public Health and Human Services had made progress in recruiting and retaining nurses “without offering a student loan repayment program, rendering this $3 million proposal unnecessary at this time.”
Two education programs — a $100,000 grant program for STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and robotics programs for students, and a $640,000 funding increase for a value-added agriculture initiative — also received the axe, with Gianforte saying the funding was vague, with no definitive plans for use. 
The biggest items Gianforte cut from the budget included an $11 million provider rate increase for air ambulance providers, which he said was a “carveout” that helped one provider type while leaving out others; a $1.6 million rate increase for contracted correctional facilities, which he said was unnecessary after the Legislature had already approved a larger allocation for similar services; $1.8 million of increased funding for prerelease facilities, which Gianforte said “may be premature,” as the Department of Correction is still negotiating with prerelease centers; and a $6 million revenue stream intended to provide funds for nonprofit organizations that work with lower-income families, which he said amounted to a “raid” on an existing program. 
“Protecting taxpayers requires us to make tough decisions, prioritizing what is necessary over what would be nice to have,” Gianforte wrote in his letter. “With the nearly $31 million in line-item reductions included here … we have more responsible spending and a budget with a stronger ending fund balance.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 20:02:31.128433

Lawmakers exempted abortion medications from new protections for off-label prescriptions. A judge will decide whether part of the law should be blocked before it goes into effect on July 1.
The post Will a new Wyoming law protect providers or limit abortions? It depends on which lawyer you ask. appeared first on WyoFile .","The same group of abortion rights advocates whose legal challenges have stymied past attempts to stop or limit abortion in Wyoming is seeking to block part of another new law.
That statute, which goes into effect July 1, codifies what is already a long-standing medical practice: that providers can legally prescribe U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for unapproved or off-label uses without fear of punishment from Wyoming licensing boards. But the new law exempts drugs intended to induce an abortion from those protections.
Abortion rights advocates worry the law “indirectly bans abortion medication by threatening physicians and pharmacists with disciplinary action for prescribing off-label use” of certain drugs that are commonly used for medication abortions. On Monday, they asked a judge to block enforcement of the part of the statute that pertains to abortion while their broader lawsuit against it and two other new abortion laws proceed through the courts.

State attorneys, who are defending all three of the laws, asked Judge Thomas T.C. Campbell to allow the off-label law to go into effect as written. They dispute that the law is another attempt to limit access to abortion medications in Wyoming. Instead, they contend it merely clarifies that the law would not supersede the Wyoming Legislature’s 2023 ban on abortion medications, which is on hold pending a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling expected later this year.
In the meantime, abortion remains legal in Wyoming.
Off-label prescriptions
Prescribing medications for off-label purposes — in other words, uses not approved by the FDA — is common practice and can be a valuable tool for health care providers. Drugs approved to treat one type of cancer might be prescribed off-label for another type of cancer. Or a doctor might, for example, prescribe propranolol, which is approved for treatment of high blood pressure, for some types of anxiety. A medication in a different dose than what is FDA-approved would also qualify as off-label use.
In 2023, the Wyoming Legislature considered a bill intended to offer protections for providers who prescribe off-label drugs. Then Rep. Sarah Penn, R-Lander, sponsored the bill in the wake of a COVID-era controversy over hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved malaria drug that some providers prescribed to treat the virus. Some of those doctors faced the prospect of disciplinary actions in other states for providing what critics said was misinformation about the drug.

Penn’s bill failed, but Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, successfully brought back a similar measure this year. House Bill 164, “Medical prescriptions-off-label purposes,” codified the practice of prescribing off-label medications. But it specified those protections did not apply to schedule I or II controlled substances (such as heroin or fentanyl), gender care for children and medications intended to induce an abortion. 
The most common regimen of those abortion medications includes the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Typically, a patient takes mifepristone first, then misoprostol one or two days later, according to medical providers cited in the plaintiff’s court documents. Both drugs are used off-label for abortion care in some circumstances.
Old case, new challenge
Wyoming’s lone abortion clinic — Casper’s Wellspring Health Access — and a group of abortion rights advocates are already suing to challenge two other laws from the 2025 legislative session. One added more stringent restrictions on abortion clinics, while a second required ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period. 
In April, Judge Campbell blocked enforcement of those laws while the legal challenge proceeds. On Monday, both sides appeared virtually in Natrona County District Court to debate whether HB 164 should also be halted while the broader case plays out.

Like past court hearings, abortion rights advocates used a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions, to help make their case. That amendment allows the Legislature to determine “reasonable and necessary restrictions” when they protect general health and welfare, and was cited by Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens when she struck down a pair of 2023 abortion bans in November.
Exempting abortion medications from off-label protections is not reasonable or necessary for public health, and is therefore unconstitutional, plaintiff’s attorney Bethany Saul argued. Most abortions are performed with medications, and the evidence shows those drugs are safe and rarely produce serious complications. 
And yet, health care providers who prescribe abortion drugs would be singled out by HB 164 and exempted from its protections without good reason, Saul told the court. If the law goes into effect as it’s now written, she added, providers may not prescribe the proper medications for their patients due to fears they might face future disciplinary actions from state licensing boards.
“This is not just a perceived risk,” she said. “We are facing a real risk.”

Senior Attorney General John Woykovsky defended the law, arguing the plaintiffs were misinterpreting HB 164. Brown, the bill’s chief sponsor, included the abortion medication exemption not as a backdoor attempt at banning the practice, but rather to align his legislation with the medication abortion ban passed by lawmakers in 2023. 
That ban, while on hold, could go into effect if the Wyoming Supreme Court rules it constitutional. The state’s highest court heard arguments on that case in April and is expected to rule later this year. If the justices affirm a lower-court decision that the ban is unconstitutional, then the abortion medication exemption in HB 164 has no effect, Woykovsky argued. He disputed the idea that the new law would discourage providers from prescribing off-label use of the medications.
“As it stands now, there are no laws in place to prohibit the use of off-label drugs for abortions,” he said. “And there should be no chilling effect.”
Judge Campbell listened to about an hour of arguments from both sides. He did not rule at the hearing, but said he would issue a decision as soon as possible given the law will go into effect in just over a week.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas oil and gas regulators unanimously approved a second lithium royalty rate Monday during a special hearing in Magnolia.
The approval marks another stage in what officials and industry believe will be a lucrative industry extracting the mineral from South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the surface. Lithium is an essential element in batteries that power electric vehicles, equipment and cell phones.
Saltwerx, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, applied for the royalty last month, just days after the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved an identical royalty for Standard Lithium and Equinor’s joint venture.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

Exxon’s newly-approved royalty rate — 2.5% — and the broader royalty payment structure are identical to Standard Lithium’s. Much of the language in the application itself was also identical.
The royalty applies only to the Pine Unit, a geographical area encompassing parts of Lafayette and Miller Counties.
“We’re pleased that Arkansas has taken an important first step to help kickstart the domestic lithium industry,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “While this is just the beginning and the road ahead is complex, this can open the door to new economic opportunities, including jobs, investment, and long-term growth for the region.”  
This was its second royalty application.
Both Standard Lithium and ExxonMobil were two of the parties to the so-called “Big 5” royalty application that the commission unanimously shot down in November. The only difference between the November application, and the two applications the AOGC has now approved is the royalty rate. In the November application, it was 1.82%. In the two that have been approved this year, it is 2.5%.
The companies vying for the rights to the brines have said they plan to use a process called direct lithium extraction (DLE). The process would allow the companies to separate the lithium from the brine, which would eventually be turned into a variety of lithium products such as lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide. 
But before that extraction can begin, a royalty has to be paid to the owners of the mineral rights underlying the brine units. Se brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission determines if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar. 
As in last month’s Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty hearing, few people objected during Monday’s hearing to Exxon’s proposed royalty. A number of entities submitted letters of support — primarily business groups and local governments that stand to benefit from lithium extraction in the area.
A group of property owners and mineral rights holders, the South Arkansas Minerals Association, objected to Exxon’s royalty application, as it has for the three previous royalty applications that have gone before the commission. 
Alan Perkins, attorney for the association, questioned the lack of financial information put forth by the company.
“It’s difficult to understand, for me, how we went from a hearing where we had a full feasibility study available and yet that wasn’t enough for the commission to make a decision, to where we are today, where we have a table with three or four lines and some very simple math,” Perkins said.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission receives ExxonMobil lithium royalty application

Exxon received a determination that it had the potential to profitably extract in April, when the regulator approved the formation of its Pine Unit — another requirement before a royalty can be determined. In November, commissioners said they had not received enough information to justify the 1.82% royalty rate, with one saying that the information they wanted would have to be provided during a unitization hearing anyway.
Six written objections, including the minerals association’s, were submitted to the commission prior to the hearing, according to the AOGC’s website.
Latwon Whitby of Forrest City, the only person to speak at the hearing other than Perkins, told commissioners it was “essential that our interests are protected.” 
He told the Advocate his family has owned mineral rights in the Pine Unit’s area for generations. He expressed frustration that Exxon insisted their royalty was “fair and equitable,” despite not, in his view, providing any evidence to back it up.
“It seemed to me that they were just wanting to get a project up and running so that they won’t go to another state,” Whitby said after the commission voted to approve the royalty. 
Prospective lithium extractors have raised the specter of taking their business to Texas or Louisiana on multiple occasions since last year, with Standard Lithium saying after the November hearing that Arkansas would lose its “first-mover advantage” if their royalty proposals weren’t given the green light.
“This decision reinforces the Commission’s commitment to fairness and consistency in Arkansas’s emerging lithium industry,” said Commission Chairman Jerry Langley in an emailed statement distributed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment. “By aligning with the structure approved last month for production in new areas of the state, we’re creating a reliable and competitive foundation for growth in this vital sector.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3601-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)A massive sell-off of millions of acres of public lands is part of the federal “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” with at least one member of Montana’s federal delegation squarely in the thick of the discussion, and land in Montana apparently off the chopping block, at least for the time being. 
Back in late May, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana stripped out a provision of the bill that would have sold 450,000 acres of land across the country and said in a press release: “This was my San Juan Hill; I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land.”
Public usage of public land is one issue unites people across the political spectrum in Montana and elsewhere.
More mass land sales were not being considered until the bill reached the U.S. Senate, and Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, added them in. The current bill calls for more than two million acres to be sold, with acreage identified across western states, but not Montana, according to one analysis.
On June 5, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ office sent out a statement saying there had been “some confusion” about Daines’ position on the sale of public lands after reports were published that he was working with Lee regarding public lands. Daines’ press secretary Gabby Wiggins clarified in a statement, “Senator Daines always has, and always will be, against the sale of public lands. Senator Daines is holding discussions with his colleagues in the Senate and bringing up his strong concerns.”
She went on to say Daines’ stance was seeking to minimize or prevent public lands sales. It’s unclear what, if anything, Daines did on the issue.
In a letter to Senator Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, a coalition of outdoor businesses wrote it would have a “significant impact” on their industry.
“Unilaterally removing lands with recreational value from public ownership is a losing issue for the American public, businesses and many Republicans in Congress,” the letter reads.
Despite not being involved in the sale, groups in Montana have voiced their concerns, too.
“2 million acres of American public land on the chopping block? Theodore Roosevelt is spinning in his grave,” Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation said in a release. There is well established law dealing with surplus federal land divestment. This is a back room deal that cuts the American public out of the process.”
None of Montana’s federal delegation responded to a request for a comment from the Daily Montanan. It’s unclear why Montana has been excluded from the land sales, or if the state’s federal delegation influenced the exclusion.
Earlier in May, Zinke helped create a bipartisan public lands caucus, which fellow Montana Rep. Troy Downing is also part of. On Friday, two Idaho senators, both Republicans, came out against the land sales, as did Daines to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.
Daines and Sen. Tim Sheehy also supported a Democratic resolution against selling public lands earlier this year.
Significant chunks of federal land are at risk of sale. The proposal would require the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to identify and sell from 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres of public lands across 11 Western states to build housing.



Data collected by The Wilderness Society, an environmental nonprofit, show how many acres of land are being considered for sale. About 2 to 3 million acres of land would be sold under the bill, though which of these tracts would be sold is unclear.

Mike DeWine. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Gov. Mike DeWine is concerned about “vulnerable” Ohioans and retaliation from Iran following the Trump administration’s strikes on its nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has joined Israel in its bombing of Iran.
“I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” Trump said during his address that evening. “Iran’s key nuclear facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”
Now, Charlie Koenigsmark, a community organizer with the anti-racism group ANSWER Coalition, fears war.
“It was completely unprovoked and a war crime, that bypassed any consultation or approval from Congress,” Koenigsmark said.
We reached out to half a dozen Middle Eastern associations and Iranian and Persian groups, but none were available to comment by our deadline. One advocate told us they were worried about speaking publicly.
Trump said he is hoping the U.S. attack would be the start to peaceful negotiations with the Middle Eastern country, but defense officials confirm Iran fired missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. That attack was intercepted, they said.
“It’s deeply upsetting,” Koenigsmark said about the possibility for war.
The state’s veterans services department told us that Ohio has more than 50,000 active duty military members, “any of whom could be pressed into a heightened military situation at any moment.”
Gov. DeWine was asked about the situation during a news conference Monday.
“Well, of course, the first thing we’re concerned about immediately is in Ohio, something that we can do something about,” DeWine responded. “Of course, we’re very concerned about that. [Department of Public Safety Director] Andy Wilson has been in contact with people who we think might be potentially vulnerable, so that was frankly our first reaction, first thing that we can do.”
Asked who is vulnerable, DeWine said he doesn’t have to spell things out.
“We always are concerned about any kind of retaliation and we don’t know.”
The U.S. needs to be united right now, he added, while also cautious.
“I think we all know that Iran and nuclear weapons are two things that should not go together, and the president took the action that he thought was appropriate,” the governor said, responding to a question about the legitimacy of the strikes.
DeWine, who served two terms in the U.S. Senate from 1995-2007, said that he doesn’t know why or how Trump made his decision.
“I do not have the intelligence that I would have had when I was in Congress and when I was on the Intelligence Committee, nor certainly do I have the briefings that the President of the United States has,” he continued. “He took the action.”
Many members of Congress have been telling reporters that they had been unaware until the strikes occurred.
“We don’t want U.S. military personnel to die just because Trump and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu are set on expanding war and regional instability — global instability, really,” Koenigsmark said.
Koenigsmark predicted anti-war protests will be going on continuously this summer. He also offered that he thought Ohio’s role in military manufacturing and research is “horrible.”
The City of Lima has the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, a facility that makes army tanks and other combat vehicles. Dayton, the home of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has a whole federal sector dedicated to aerospace defense.
In January, Governor Mike DeWine announced that Pickaway County, outside of Columbus, will be the home of a new manufacturing plant for Anduril Industries, a major U.S. defense contractor, to create weapons & drones.
One of the incentives to bring the factory to Ohio is that the company will be getting more than $450 million in state tax credits. Anduril and JobsOhio estimate that the plant will produce more than $2 billion in economic output.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A Utah college student arrested by federal immigration agents in Mesa County earlier this month was released Friday after what she called the “nightmare” of a 15-day stay in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. The deputy has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether a Signal message leading to Dias Goncalves’ arrest violated Colorado laws prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE.
The University of Utah nursing student was then held at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, before being released on bond Friday evening, she said in a statement released through immigration advocates on Monday.
“The past 15 days have been the hardest of my life,” Dias Goncalves said. “I was scared and felt alone. I was placed in a system that treated me like I didn’t matter.”

A daily average of more than 1,100 people are held in the Aurora ICE detention center, the only such facility in Colorado. Dias Goncalves, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. as a 7-year-old, described having to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and other dehumanizing treatment towards detainees in the facility.
“The moment they realized I spoke English, I saw a change. Suddenly, I was treated better than others who didn’t speak English,” her statement added. “That broke my heart. Because no one deserves to be treated like that. Not in a country that I’ve called home since I was 7 years old and is all I’ve ever known.”
ICE has not replied to questions from Newsline and other media outlets about Dias Goncalves’ arrest, which has sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“We are hurting our nation — and our very soul — when we target immigrant youth this way,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a statement on Dias Goncalves’ release. “One traffic stop. One unlawful arrest. And a lifetime of trauma. Enough is enough.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record — Dias Goncalves among them — has risen sharply since January.
Representatives for Dias Goncalves said she and her family were requesting privacy following her release. In her statement, she said she would try to “move forward” and focus on work and school, and directly addressed the ICE agent who detained her.
“He kept apologizing and told me he wanted to let me go, but his ‘hands were tied.’ There was nothing he could do, even though he knew it wasn’t right,” Dias Goncalves wrote. “I want you to know — I forgive you. Because I believe that people can make better choices when they’re allowed to.”

Politicians, scores of businesses, join rapidly growing criticism of budget measure targeting federally owned land in Western states.
The post Wyoming opposition intensifies against public land sell-off appeared first on WyoFile .","Opposition to a Republican plan to sell millions of acres of federal public land in the West intensified over the weekend, with politicians, individuals and scores of businesses criticizing the budget proposal.
The groundswell of opposition has grown beyond green groups, tree huggers and naturalists after the Wilderness Society published a map of the federal properties eligible for sale, including iconic western landscapes at New Fork and Green River lakes.
Eighty-five Wyoming businesses representing myriad entities from small-scale loggers to international brands called the proposed sell-off “a non-starter for Wyomingites and all Americans.” In letters to Republican U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, they said the state’s outdoor culture “is under threat by a concerted movement to transfer or sell federal public lands.”
Politicians, including former Wyoming Speaker of the House Albert Sommers, R-Pinedale, weighed in. The plan will affect “literally everyone in Wyoming, as well as out-of-state visitors our tourism industry depends on,” Sommers wrote Barrasso.
“Why do the lifestyles of 11 Western states have to bear the burden of paying national debt created by the other 39 states as well?” Tom Lubnau
Another former speaker warned that “billionaires and corporations, and perhaps foreign countries,” will be the successful bidders if the measure passes. Those rich and powerful entities will use their purchases to control public access, locking up public lands “tighter than a miser’s fist on a handful of pennies,” former Rep. Tom Lubnau, R-Gillette, wrote in an op-ed in the Cowboy State Daily.
The way the bill is written “will not benefit the people of Wyoming,” state Democrats in the Legislature said in a statement Friday. “We are strongly against,” the eight lawmakers wrote.
“The bill provides very little if any guardrails or transparency,” Rep. Mike Schmid, R-LaBarge, president and CEO of a well-services company, wrote in another opinion piece. “That should alarm every single American who values public access and national security.”
Teton County asked to be exempted from any sales.
“Disposal of public land in Teton County, as contemplated in the reconciliation bill, is much more likely to worsen our housing crisis rather than to mitigate or address our housing shortage,” county commissioners said in letters to Wyoming’s senators.
What it does
“The development of additional luxury homes, as almost certainly dictated by our real estate market, only creates more jobs and worsens the imbalance between local jobs and local houses that our workforce can afford.”
Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s proposed “mandatory disposal” of an estimated 2-3 million acres of land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would fast-track the sales. The measure, which is expected to be part of the Senate version of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” would purportedly cure the twin problems of scant affordable housing and the national deficit. Critics say the measure would fund tax breaks for the wealthy.
The provision targets 11 Western states and would bypass existing laws and regulations, like those of the BLM, that allow public-interest land sales “developed with public involvement and environmental analysis.” It would funnel land sales proceeds into the treasury instead of the agencies themselves, as existing laws mandate.
Lee’s proposal would require agencies to quickly — within 60 days and regularly thereafter — start accepting nominations from individuals and entities for tracts to be sold. It gives sales authority to the secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture departments.

The measure would prioritize sales of parcels nominated by state or local governments near existing development and suitable for housing. It does not require or ensure that housing would be or remain affordable. It would also allow land to be sold and used for infrastructure.
A provision that put checkerboard-area holdings on the priority list was dropped in a rewrite. WyoFile did not receive a response from the GOP staff on Lee’s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee as to why checkerboard lands were first prioritized, then removed.
Lee’s measure originally excluded lands on which the agencies had issued grazing permits, an exemption that’s also since been removed, according to the National Wildlife Federation.
The measure would exclude from the sale protected lands such as national parks, wilderness areas and so on. It also excludes Montana. Critics say that’s an effort to curry favor with U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, who opposes the sale of public lands and whose budget vote is critical.
In letters to constituents, Barrasso and Lummis sought to quell fears.
“Please be assured,” Lummis wrote one resident, “it is one of my top priorities to maintain and improve public access on public lands for activities such as hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, hiking and biking.”
She wrote that state citizens could better control the property belonging to all Americans. “I believe that the people of Wyoming are the best stewards of the land, not unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.”
Barrasso said he supports federal land sales “when they serve the interests of states, local communities and the public.” What’s on the table would impact “less than one percent of our federal lands,” he wrote.
“I am committed to efficient multiple-use management of our public lands to ensure continued public access, healthy wildlife, and productive ecosystems,” he wrote. Contrary to analysis by the Wilderness Society and the National Wildlife Federation, Barrasso said he believes the measure would not allow the sale of land permitted for grazing.
Barrasso’s staff did not immediately respond to an inquiry Monday regarding how the senator’s Wyoming Range Legacy Act might conflict with the land sales provision.
In 2007, Barrasso fulfilled a promise to push the act previously championed by the late U.S. Sen Craig Thomas of Wyoming, by successfully withdrawing more than 1.2 million acres in the mountains between Afton’s Star Valley and Pinedale’s Upper Green River country from new oil and gas leasing. Now, however, much of that country is open to be nominated for sale, according to the Wilderness Society map.
Hageman attacks “ecoterrorist”
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, another Wyoming Republican, lashed out at the Wilderness Society in a Cowboy State Daily opinion column published Friday.
“There has been an awful lot of misinformation in recent days,” Hageman wrote, with “a lot of the talk surrounding [Lee’s] efforts … misleading or flat out untrue.” She said the Wilderness Society was “the biggest culprit so far … working overtime to misrepresent what [Lee’s provision] actually does.”
The TWS map is “a fundraising rant, attempting to scare us,” she wrote, calling TWS president Tracy Stone-Manning a “hypocritical ecoterrorist,” and the interactive map “hogwash.”
The conservation group’s caterwauling, Hageman wrote, is “an effort to control these lands to ensure our amenities are used solely by the independently wealthy, who have little concern as to whether there is affordable housing available for the people who seek to make their lives in places like Kemmerer or Green River or Pinedale.”
But the map “accurately use[s] the exact criteria for eligible lands included in the most recent publicly available draft,” Wilderness Society Wyoming State Director Julia Stuble said in a statement Monday. “Broad sell-offs of public land are deeply unpopular in Wyoming and it is entirely understandable that laying out the lands eligible for sale in the bill, without exaggeration or bias, would elicit outrage.”
Lee’s provision is headed down a complex path in the Senate where it could be stricken, dropped, amended or adopted before the reconciliation bill moves back to the House. Meantime, former Wyoming Speaker of the House Lubnau wondered: “Why do the lifestyles of 11 Western states have to bear the burden of paying national debt created by the other 39 states as well?”

RUTLAND CITY — Hundreds of people over the weekend toasted to the smashing success of the Rutland County Pride festival at Bailey’s Place, a new bar and lounge space for LGBTQ+ residents in the Marble City. 
Approximately 6,000 people were expected to attend the Rutland County Pride event and around 500 people dropped by the bar, which opened in April, according to Bailey’s Place co-owner Faith McClure.
Bailey’s Place is only one of a handful of bars in Vermont founded for the purpose of creating a space for their local LGBTQ+ communities, according to McClure. In 2021, Fox Market and Bar in East Montpelier ended a nearly 15-year drought of LGBTQ+ bars in the state, and Foxy’s in Barre joined the slim ranks of Vermont’s LGBTQ+ bars in 2024.

The building for Bailey’s Place on Evelyn Street was briefly Prouty’s Parlor ice cream shop and before that housed the bars Strangefellows, which closed around the Covid-19 pandemic, and Shooka Dookas, which closed in 2006, according to McClure.
While Shooka Dookas and Strangefellows evolved into de-facto gay bars, Bailey’s Place is the first designated LGBTQ+ bar to open in Rutland City, McClure said. 
The 21-year-old owner said it was important for her to designate Bailey’s Place as an LGBTQ+ lounge in Rutland, as she hopes to create a space that is “all inclusive.” McClure said her stepfather and co-owner Fred Watkins helped rehabilitate the Bailey’s Place property, which occupies a historic building in Rutland City’s downtown near the train station. `
“There’s a lot of spaces downtown that I feel like could be revitalized to be welcoming community spaces like this,” McClure said. “I’ve had other queer people in the community come up to me, and they’ll say this to me directly going, ‘Oh, there’s not really a whole lot of spaces in Rutland. If there is the closest one is like, three hours away.’”

During Rutland’s Pride festivities over the weekend, the bar and lounge offered karaoke, a DJ and drag performances, along with food and drinks throughout Saturday night. McClure said 25% of the proceeds from sales of its cocktail special, a strawberry lemon drop, are set to be allocated to the Rutland County Pride Center. 
“People loved the performers over at Bailey’s. People were digging karaoke,” she said. “We were really happy that everyone had a good time.”
During the daytime Pride events, McClure also operated a Bailey’s Place booth along with dozens of vendors lining the streets of Rutland City’s downtown.
The festival organized by the Rutland County Pride Center kicked off with speeches from U.S. Rep. Becca Baliant, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to represent Vermont in Congress; Christine Halquist, the first transgender Democratic nominee for Vermont governor; Mia Shultz, the president of the Rutland County NAACP; and city officials.

McClure said people at the Pride festival were “pretty focused on the joy” of the day but that it’s important to celebrate Pride amid growing concerns over government actions limiting LGBTQ+ rights across the country.
“It lets people know that in these hard times with our country, with what the government’s doing with the rights of those in the LGBTQ+ community, that there are still people like Bailey’s who are going to be around for as long as the community will allow us to be,” McClure said. 
As the community for Bailey’s Place grows, McClure said her long-term goal is to expand or move into a bigger space to accommodate dancing and larger celebrations. In the meantime, McClure said she and her team have been working one day at a time to renovate the bar, refine the food and drink menu, and host trivia nights and other events to attract new customers. 
“It’s nice to know for the Rutland community that there’s something in your backyard,” she said.

A motion filed in federal court by the Department of Justice argues the law, which takes effect next month, is unconstitutional because it “deprives Catholic priests of their fundamental right to freely exercise their religious beliefs, as guaranteed under the First Amendment.” 
“The punishment for directly violating the sacramental seal of Confession is excommunication. A more direct burden on the exercise of religion would be difficult to imagine,” federal attorneys wrote in their motion to intervene in a case brought by Washington bishops last month.
That case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. 
At issue is Senate Bill 5375, which will take effect July 27. It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Disclosures in confession or other rites where the religious leader is bound to confidentiality are not exempt. But under the law, clergy will retain their privilege to avoid testifying in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, along with Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane, sued May 29 arguing the law violates their First Amendment right to practice religion free of government interference, and is religious discrimination because it will force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties are named as defendants. 
The Department of Justice is only seeking to sue the state and wants the federal court to bar enforcement of the law against Catholic priests who refuse to disclose information obtained in confession.
“The Justice Department will not sit idly by when States mount attacks on the free exercise of religion,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a press release. 
Attorney General Nick Brown declined to comment on the new filing.
“We will review this complaint and respond in court,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for the Attorney General’s Office.
Monday’s move isn’t unexpected. On May 5, the Department of Justice announced it had opened a civil rights investigation into the “apparent conflict” of the new law with “the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment.”
Ferguson, a Catholic, said when he signed the bill that requiring disclosures learned in confession did not give him pause.
Weeks later, when the legal fight began, the governor said he was “disappointed my Church is filing a federal lawsuit to protect individuals who abuse kids.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/church-windows-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

(Photo via Getty Images Plus)A group of several businesses and organizations filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the new Iowa law putting regulations in place for pharmacy benefit managers, the companies negotiating prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies.
The lawsuit against the Iowa Insurance Commissioner was brought by the Iowa Association of Business and Industry, as well as Des Moines Orthopaedic Surgeons PC, Iowa Spring Manufacturing & Sales Co. and health plans the Iowa Bankers Benefit Plan, Iowa Laborers District Council Health and Welfare Fund. The suit against the state argues Senate File 383, signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier in June, is unlawful and contradicts federal PBM regulations.
The law, supported by pharmacists and other rural health care advocates during the 2025 legislative session, restricts certain PBM business practices that supporters of the measure said coerce or force consumers to use certain pharmacies to fill prescriptions. These entities are banned from adding financial advantages or penalties for certain pharmacies when filling an order and setting different cost-sharing rates under the law. It also requires pharmacies to be reimbursed for the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug and establishes a $10.68 dispensing reimbursement fee for each prescription filled by independent and rural pharmacies.

While supporters said these provisions will help struggling pharmacies in many Iowa communities, several business and health insurance industry organizations have repeatedly criticized the measures as they will potentially raise the prescription drug and health coverage costs for Iowans. The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Des Moines argued the new law will “raise healthcare costs for businesses across the state – large and small – by tens of millions of dollars.”
The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the law and for the court to rule the measure is unlawful.
In a news release on the lawsuit, ABI officials argued the measure was not only preempted by federal law on PBMs, but was unconstitutional by restricting free speech.
The measure could make it illegal for employers to tell their employees “about ways to save money, such as avoiding a $10.68 fee by using certain pharmacies,” according to the release.
“We’re challenging this new Iowa law because it’s going to raise health care costs for businesses of all sizes across the state by hundreds of millions of dollars,” ABI President Nicole Crain said in a statement. “It will also disrupt the prescription drug coverage that Iowans count on, and it even stops health plans from giving people simple, money-saving information, like which pharmacy has the better deal. That’s bad policy that goes against federal law and violates the First Amendment.”
Organizations like the Iowa Pharmacy Association and lawmakers backing the law repeatedly said claims the measure will significantly raise health care costs in Iowa are untrue, pointing to other states that have enacted similar measures without seeing dramatic increases in health insurance premiums.
Reynolds said in a statement when she signed the measure that it would address several PBM business practices that harm patients and small pharmacies, but said her administration will conduct ongoing review to assess the impacts of the law as it takes effect.
“The complexity and lack of verifiable data made signing this bill a difficult decision, and my administration will closely monitor implementation to mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed,” Reynolds wrote. “We will also be launching a reverse auction to ensure Iowa’s state health plan continues to keep costs as low as possible for the state and its employees.”

(Kimbrell photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA. Wilson photo by John A. Carlos. Both are special to the SC Daily Gazette.)The race to be South Carolina’s next governor has officially begun.
Two Republicans — Josh Kimbrell, a state senator from the Upstate; and South Carolina’s longtime attorney general, Alan Wilson — formally announced their bids Monday in what promises to be a crowded run for the Governor’s Mansion in 2026.
Hours before Wilson was scheduled to make his formal announcement at an event in his home county of Lexington, Kimbrell made his campaign official in an e-mail blast. The Boiling Springs Republican will follow up with a launch celebration Saturday.
The pair of announcements comes a little less than a year ahead of the GOP primary, in a state where Republicans occupy all statewide offices, six of seven U.S. House seats, and a supermajority in both chambers in the Legislature. It’s been almost 20 years since a Democrat won any statewide office in South Carolina: Jim Rex narrowly won his bid in 2006 to become state superintendent of education.
Filing for the June 2026 primaries is still nine months away.
At least four other Republicans could launch a bid for governor before then. They include U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, of the coastal 1st District, who has been bashing her potential gubernatorial opponents for months, as well as Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, who is expected to make a decision within the next month, according to a consultant working with the Travelers Rest Republican.
Former state treasurer and reality TV star Thomas Ravenel announced a bid in early February but jumped back out four days later.
State Sen. Sean Bennett also continues to weigh a run. The Summerville Republican told the SC Daily Gazette he intends to evaluate the field of candidates “to see if the race needs me or if it doesn’t need me.” And U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman has told reporters he’ll make an announcement July 27.
Should Norman enter the governor’s race, state Sen. Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, told the SC Daily Gazette he would consider a bid for to replace him in the 5th District, which includes the suburbs of Charlotte, N.C., and stretches from Spartanburg County southeast to Sumter County.
So far only one Democrat, state Rep. Jermaine Johnson, of Columbia, has said he is considering a run.
Who’s in
Of the two officially in the running, Wilson has spent that last 14 ½ years as South Carolina’s top prosecutor, making him the nation’s longest-serving attorney general. When first elected to the job in November 2010, he replaced his former employer, then two-term Attorney General Henry McMaster, who made an unsuccessful bid for governor that year.
Wilson, 51, has since challenged the Obama and Biden administrations in numerous federal lawsuits, to include multi-state actions in his twice-elected role as chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Those challenges have included vaccine mandates, environmental regulations, transgender issues, student loan cancellations, immigration and the Affordable Care Act.
At the state level, he has defended multiple challenges to the state’s six-week abortion ban. He pushed to create the state Human Trafficking Task Force, which he leads. And he has championed legislation criminalizing artificially generated child porn, which became law earlier this year, and sought protections for victims of sex crimes.
In 2013, Wilson launched an investigation into then-House Speaker Bobby Harrell but then handed the case to 1st District Solicitor David Pascoe in 2014, citing an unspecified conflict of interest, who later turned out to be his political consultant. Pascoe, who recently announced a party switch to Republican, expanded the case to other GOP legislators despite Wilson’s attempt to fire him.
Wilson, the son of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina’s 2nd District, lives in Lexington with his wife and two children. He has served for nearly three decades in the Army National Guard.
Kimbrell, who got his start as host of the conservative Christian talk show “Common Cents” on an Upstate radio station, has made his brand as a social conservative.
In 2020, he ousted state Sen. Glenn Reese, a Democrat who had held the seat for three decades.
In the Senate, he’s been a proponent of the state restrictions on abortion. He also pushed to insert rules into the state budget banning books with sexual content from children’s sections in public libraries and withholding funding from the city of Columbia unless it repealed its law banning licensed therapists from offering so-called conversion therapy to LGBTQ+ minors.
If elected governor, Kimbrell pledges to “champion policies that promote God, family, and faith, ensuring South Carolina remains a beacon of traditional values.”
Other priorities, according to his campaign website, include eliminating the state’s personal income tax, implementing universal school choice, prioritizing mental health care for veterans and using artificial intelligence to sort through and sunset state regulations within 100 days.

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania’s tax on natural gas development and fracking brought in $164.5 million in 2024 – about $15 million less than the previous year. 
The state Public Utility Commission attributes the decline to a decrease in new wells, which are subject to the highest fees, and natural gas prices that remained roughly even to the previous year. It’s also around $100 million less than in 2022, which saw record revenue.
The tax on new fracking and gas drilling, called an impact fee, was created in 2012 to generate money from energy companies to distribute to communities seeking to address environmental impacts or infrastructure needs created by drilling. Drilling companies pay for each well they own based on the average cost of natural gas and the age of the well, with older wells costing less.
Drilling for natural gas can create environmental issues and pollution, as well as health problems for the surrounding community. Those can be exacerbated if wells are abandoned and land isn’t reclaimed after their use. 
The PUC says the bulk of the money, about $86.5 million, will go to counties and municipalities affected by drilling. Some $57.7 million is earmarked for  the Marcellus Legacy Fund, which supports statewide environmental initiatives and infrastructure projects. Another $20.4 million will be distributed to state agencies like the Department of Environmental Protection, the Emergency Management Agency and others.
“The impact fee continues to provide significant and sustained support for Pennsylvania communities – especially those directly affected by natural gas development,” PUC Chair Stephen M. DeFrank said in a statement.
Jim Welty, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, also weighed in. 
“Natural gas development delivers real, measurable benefits for Pennsylvania communities – driving job creation, powering economic growth and strengthening energy security,” he said in a statement. ““Beyond these core advantages, this industry continues to invest in projects that improve quality of life across the Commonwealth.”
The announcement comes roughly a month after the state Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee approved a bill that would withhold funds raised through impact fees from counties and municipalities that “unreasonably limit” natural gas development, regardless of the impact of nearby wells. As it stands, counties and municipalities with active natural gas development generally receive a larger share of funds.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/natural-gas-well-site-1024x570.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

Free.,US Supreme Court allows third-country deportations for now,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-allows-third-country-deportations-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday to allow, for now, the Trump administration to carry out deportations to third countries after a Massachusetts judge barred removals without proper notice.An unsigned order approved by six justices granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to stay a lower court’s decision that barred third-country removals without first giving those removed a chance to raise concerns if they are likely to face harm in the country where they are being deported.“In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent. “In this case, the Government took the opposite approach.”Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Sotomayor’s dissent.Third-country removals, deportations from the United States to a nation other than an immigrant’s home country, occur when the home country does not accept the immigrant’s repatriation.The Supreme Court order reverses a preliminary injunction U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of the District of Massachusetts ordered in April that those being removed to a third country must have at least 15 days to challenge their removal if they fear they could face harm.Murphy followed up with an order in early May to delay the removals of several immigrant men from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba and Mexico who were on deportation flights to South Sudan.After Murphy found their removal violated his preliminary injunction, the immigrants were rerouted to a U.S. military base in the East African country of Djibouti, where they had credible fear interviews.The unsigned order means that Murphy’s order is put on hold while the case continues.As the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, the high court’s order will make it easier for the administration to remove immigrants to countries if their home country does not accept their deportation.Sotomayor, in her dissent, said the decision violates due process, the right of people on U.S. soil to defend themselves in court. She argued that the Trump administration openly violated the lower court’s order when several immigrants were removed to South Sudan, which was not their home country.“​​By rewarding lawlessness, the Court once again undermines that foundational principle,” she said. “Apparently, the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the Government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled.”",,,,2025-06-23 19:03:11.550237

Educators at The Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center, better known as The Met School, have voted to unionize with the National Education Association Rhode Island (NEARI).
The Met is a state-funded public school district with a focus on individualized, project-based learning. Across two campuses in Providence and one in Newport, there are 83 educators in total. 
The vote tally for the unionization effort was 46-36, with 82 of 83 eligible voters casting ballots. Stephanie Mandeville, a spokesperson for NEARI, wrote in an email Monday that the vote can become official after five business days, unless the employer files an objection during that timeframe. Otherwise, the aspiring union members can file their first request to bargain a contract after five days, Mandeville said. 
The Met School acknowledged a request for comment Monday, but did not provide comment at the time. 
In the 2023-2024 school year, there were 793 students at The Met School, according to state education department data. Since opening in 1996, The Met School has used what its website labels a “one student at a time” approach, employing learning plans tailored to individual students and crafted in collaboration with youth and their families. 
The Met’s model avoids traditional classroom settings and grading metrics in favor of real-world experiences like internships led by students’ own interests. The school has partnered with over 4,000 local businesses and organizations to supply students with real-world experience, according to its website. 
Advisers form the nucleus of The Met experience, guiding students through their four years of high school. Advisers are typically responsible for groups of about 16 students. Adviser Siobhan O’Malley, who has eight years of experience teaching in Providence, offered a statement on the unionization vote Friday.  
“Met educators are deeply committed to our students, families, and the future of public education. For 30 years, we’ve provided a phenomenal education — one student at a time,” O’Malley wrote. “Now, we’ve organized to ensure that The Met continues to thrive, with smaller class sizes, greater transparency, and a real voice in shaping the future of our school.” 
State data showed that, in the 2023-2024 school year, The Met outperformed state averages in several measures, including postsecondary enrollment. A little over 96% of The Met students graduated in four years, compared to 84.1% of Rhode Island high schoolers statewide. 
The Met School is more demographically diverse than other districts, with significantly higher populations of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students compared to statewide averages. A 2.8% dropout rate at The Met is also lower than the state average of 7.9%.
The Met slightly outpaces the state average on proficiency in English Language arts, but trails when it comes to math and science. In the 2023-2024 data, 58.1% of Met students did not meet math proficiency standards, compared to 27.1% of students statewide.
The Providence Met was the first school in the Big Picture Learning network — a collection of over 270 schools globally that pursue the same nontraditional learning model. A Rhode Island state referendum in 1994 for a new kind of high school encouraged the school’s founders to model a new, more personalized approach for learning. By 2003, Rhode Island’s Board of Education started to incorporate some of The Met’s tenets — like advisers and senior exhibitions — into statewide graduation requirements for traditional public schools. 
The Met teachers’ unionization push follows a spate of recent unionizing efforts by educators at non-traditional schools. Teachers at all three grade levels of Paul Cuffee School, a Providence charter, unionized one-by-one in the past year. Highlander Charter School in Providence unionized in August 2024.

The Burlington High School community is mourning the loss of student Eljak Menjwak, who drowned Saturday at Bartlett Falls in Bristol.
The 18-year-old senior jumped from the falls into the New Haven River around 5:10 p.m. He immediately began to struggle in the water, and bystanders were not able to pull him out, according to a press release from Vermont State Police.
Multiple fire and rescue agencies responded to emergency calls, including Bristol Rescue. Menjwak’s body was recovered around 8 p.m., the release said.
State police do not consider the death suspicious or criminal in nature, department spokesperson Adam Silverman said.
“Eljak was a bright light in our school district,” Schools Superintendent Tom Flanagan wrote in a letter to the school community Sunday. “He was deeply loved by his peers, teachers, and mentors, and his presence will be profoundly missed.” 
Counseling services would be available to students and families at Burlington High School on Monday, at Champlain Elementary on Tuesday, and Edmunds Middle School on Thursday, Flanagan’s statement said. Support for staff members will be provided through the employee assistance program. Community members have also started an online GoFundMe fundraiser to support the family.
A viewing is planned for 5 p.m. Friday at the Cathedral of St. Joseph, and the burial will be the following day, school district spokesperson Russell Elek said.

BURLINGTON – Shabir Ayoubi and his wife were approved to resettle in the United States more than a year ago, but navigating bureaucracy stalled the process for months and required expensive visits to U.S. embassies in Pakistan. They eventually arrived in Vermont one snowy evening two months ago.
One of the state’s newest residents, Ayoubi, who now lives in Burlington, was among the people celebrating World Refugee Day Saturday at Leddy Park.
“I came here by chance today,” said Ayoubi, 34. He heard about the event and got a ride from a case worker. He didn’t know it was a party and left his wife behind, he said. They don’t have a vehicle.
They are among the more than 600 Afghans resettled across Vermont after fleeing a country taken over by the Taliban, an extremist group, after what became the longest war in U.S. military history.
The U.S.-led invasion began in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack and ended in 2021 after U.S. troops withdrew and the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital city.
Designated by the United Nations, World Refugee Day is celebrated worldwide on June 20 to honor the strength and resilience of people forced to flee their home countries and to shine a light on their rights and needs.
On a sunny summer afternoon, more than 100 refugees enjoyed food, games and camaraderie with their families, resettlement groups, volunteers and allies in a celebration organized by the local chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit international organization that addresses and fights for the needs and rights of refugees and immigrants.

Since 1980, USCRI has helped resettle more than 8,500 refugees in Vermont, many of whom were forced to flee their homes because of war, genocide, torture and repressive regimes. These include survivors of the Rwandan massacre, Congolese fleeing war, Afghans persecuted by the Taliban and Ukrainians whose villages were destroyed, according to a Friday press release from USCRI.
Sonali Samarasinghe, field office director of USCRI in Colchester, said the annual picnic aims to celebrate the contributions of new residents in Vermont, many of who showed up Saturday in colorful clothes and traditional attire.
“You enrich us with your culture, your religion, your skills, your food and your commitment to hard work,” she said in a brief speech Saturday. “In this beautiful diversity that we see here today, we are all unified.”
Between games, chatter, plates of heaped food — donated by community partners such as People’s Kitchen, American Flatbread, Grand Buffet, Lake Champlain Chocolate and Hannaford — families enjoyed a picnic in the sun on the shores of Lake Champlain.

Children laughed while rolling off a large ball representing the earth, kicked around soccer balls, spun hula hoops around their bodies, ducked under a large parachute and lined up for fast-melting ice cream on a warm afternoon.
Under a tent, FaReid Munarsyah of The People’s Kitchen served up generous portions of barbecued meats.
“It’s good,” said Aline Kwizera, who came from Burundi and is a multilingual instructor in the Burlington schools. “I love that people can come, talk and share their experiences like this.”

Relocated from Afghanistan in 2024, “best student” Hamida Panjshiri was among former members of the Afghan judiciary who were relocated to the U.S. She lives in Brattleboro, is learning to drive through the Afghan Alliance’s driving program and continues to take weekly English lessons.
“I’m good. I’m happy,” she said. “Because people in Vermont are very kind.”
A French and Spanish interpreter and English tutor with USCRI for more than two decades, Skapski said, “I just love seeing my students, their progress and how much they give to the community.”
While some of the refugees were reluctant to speak about the Trump administration’s roll back of refugee aid, travel and rights, some advocates did not hold back.

“Refugees make Vermont great,” said Tracy Dolan, director of the state refugee office in a brief speech. “We need refugees in Vermont. We need immigrants in Vermont. And we are happy to share our home with you. And no matter what is happening outside of Vermont, no matter what is happening in the country or with the government, we can be together and we can focus on the positive. And we will keep fighting. We will keep fighting for you.”
State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said generations of refugees and immigrants have helped build a stronger nation, from the first Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution in England to his own ancestors to the new refugees who call Vermont home.
“As state treasurer, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future of the Vermont economy,” he said. “As I stand here today with you and enjoy the music, the food and the culture, I can tell you that it’s so clear that refugees do so much more than simply grow our economy. You strengthen our communities all across the state.”
“Refugees so often represent the best of what America means at its core,” he said, thanking the community for leaving behind their hardships and suffering and bringing their strength and resilience to build a life, find community, adjust to a new language and culture – and then having “the strength and the grace” to give back to Vermont with their labor, culture and presence.
Though he is happy to finally be here, to have housing and a job, Ayoubi acknowledged it has been a rough few years for his family, between fleeing Afghanistan and managing the paperwork and delays that stalled their relocation. “It was frustrating,” he said.
Before the Taliban takeover, Ayoubi said he worked in quality control and security for organizations that supported U.S. troops. Barely settled in, Ayoubi is eager to get back to work. 
“I am happy to do anything,” he said.
Ayoubi resettled in Burlington in May as part of a partnership between the Vermont Afghan Alliance, USCRI, Central Vermont Refugee Action Network, and No One Left Behind to continue to welcome Afghans fleeing their homes. He has secured a job with a security services company in Burlington, the Alliance confirmed.
In the face of escalating Trump administration cuts to refugee programs and funding, the theme of this year’s celebration – solidarity with refugees – rings hollow for many refugees across the nation and in Vermont. It’s particularly egregious for the Afghans who served the U.S. but now “face significant challenges and unmet promises,” Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, noted in a Friday press release.
“These Afghan allies risked their lives and the safety of their families to support U.S. missions. In return for their invaluable service, the U.S. Government promised them relocation to the United States and the opportunity to reunite with their families here in Vermont. Unfortunately, almost three years later, many of these promises remain unfulfilled,” the release stated.

The state had an average precipitation of 1.82 inches during the reporting period, which was about six-tenths of an inch above the normal. Some areas of the state had higher precipitation for the reporting period, like Mason City which accumulated 4.41 inches — the most for the week.
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly from last week, on average 73% of topsoil moisture was adequate, and just 16% of topsoil was short of moisture. Subsoil moisture for the state as a whole rated 65% adequate and 21% short.

Soil moisture conditions were the worst in southern regions, in particular the southwest region, and also rated poorly in northwest and west central portions of the state.
Temperatures across Iowa were high during the reporting period, with an average of 76 degrees Fahrenheit, which is nearly 5 degrees above normal, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. 
“Exceedingly warm daytime temperatures in concert with high dewpoints and sustained strong southerly winds produced anomalous conditions not seen at many locations in the observational record,” Glisan wrote in the preliminary weather summary for the state. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the hot, humid and windy conditions from the past week “really made it feel like summer.” 
“Some areas across north-central Iowa received several inches of rain with other locations receiving uninvited hail and high winds,” Naig said. “The warmer temperatures and increased chances for rain are likely to continue through the end of the month.”

Rusty Black, a Republican from Chillicothe, chairs the first meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force earlier this month (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A group tasked by the governor with reworking Missouri’s formula for funding public schools narrowed in on property tax revenue Monday, discussing how the 20-year-old formula creates inequities with an outdated assumption of local aid.
In the second meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, education officials led a conversation on property taxes.
The problem stems from a figure frozen in time, said Kari Monsees, deputy commissioner of the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The formula subtracts assumed local aid based on 2005 property values and applies the same tax rate statewide even though districts vary widely on levies.
“The longer we go on, the further we get from the actual values on our assumptions and the more problematic it is for what we’re trying to do here,” Monsees said.
Since the creation of the current formula in 2005, property values have fluctuated with variation across districts.
“There’s been a lot of changes in property values since 2005,” said David Wood, a former state representative and policy analyst for the Missouri State Tax Commission. “If you try to jump to current numbers… it’s going to be extremely expensive.”
But increasing the cost to the state’s general revenue is not an option.
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s executive order, which convened the work group, calls for funding outcomes “at a level consistent with what is provided for in the State Fiscal Year 2025 budget.” This amount is $300 million under the current budget passed by state lawmakers and awaiting the governor’s signature.
Missouri governor calls for task force to keep state education funding flat

Missouri is seventh in the nation for reliance on property tax revenue for funding public schools, with 47% of funds coming from local taxes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Missouri has the lowest portion of state aid in its public-school funding, at 30% of school revenues.
The state’s reliance on local funding combined with its outdated figures for property taxes has created a system of winners and losers, with communities with growing property values and higher levies accumulating more funds on a per-pupil basis than their counterparts.
If the assessments 20 years ago were accurate and change was uniform across districts, there  would be “less of a concern,” Monsees said.
“But that’s not the reality,”  he said. “The reality is those reassessment rates and value changes have been significantly different across the state.”
The median home value in districts varies wildly, ranging from $44,500 to $613,300, according to a 2019 review Monsees presented.
The formula assumes a local levy of $3.43 per $100 of assessed value, dubbed the “performance levy.” But districts’ levies vary from $2.75 to almost $6.50 per $100.
He shared examples of districts in the 90th and 10th percentiles, showing some districts have double the operating funds on a per-pupil basis.
Worsening the gaps between districts is a “hold-harmless provision” in the foundation formula, which keeps funding levels stable for districts that would’ve seen a dip in revenue when the formula was established. There are 200 hold-harmless districts, with districts under 350 students keeping total state aid flat and those over 350 getting the same amount per student.
Missouri has had hold-harmless provisions through multiple iterations of the school funding formula, and Monsees said there’s a reason for that. The formula has to be approved by the state legislature, and lawmakers whose districts are losing funds are likely to vote against any changes.
A study of the formula commissioned by education nonprofit Aligned estimates that hold-harmless provisions cost the state $150 million annually. The study recommends that any new formula institute a “temporary hold-harmless provision with a five-year phase out.”
The study is one of three being reviewed by task force members. All three recommended changes in multiple areas to the formula, such as increasing multipliers used to increase funding for special education and measuring student count by enrollment rather than attendance.
The work group is anticipated to meet over the next year and deliver plans to the governor by December 2026.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1621-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

(Getty Images)New legislation from the state Senate president would allow public entities to stop publishing legal notices in news outlets, a move that would end a practice critics say makes little sense in the 21st-century media environment.
Senate President Nick Scutari’s bill would permit governments to post legal notices on their own websites starting March 1, 2026, and require the secretary of state to help set up a website that would include legal notices from all of New Jersey’s public entities.
The state’s public notice requirements came under renewed scrutiny with the February demise of the Star-Ledger, formerly the state’s largest newspaper (the paper’s owners still produce an online edition). The paper’s end left many public entities without a local newspaper to publish their notices in.
Newspaper publishers have long fought to retain the state’s requirement that legal notices get printed in news outlets, saying published legal notices allow the public to keep tabs on their leaders’ actions.
Brett Ainsworth, president of the New Jersey Press Association, said proposals like Scutari’s take away information from the very places people seek it out — independent news media. 
“Doing so diminishes transparency and erodes trust in government,” Ainsworth said in a statement.
Scutari’s bill has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the Senate’s budget committee. Bills that are not voted on by June 30 typically don’t face a hearing until the Legislature returns from its summer hiatus. During election years like this one — the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot in November — lawmakers often don’t return to Trenton until after Election Day. 
Ainsworth said he supports a separate proposal from Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) that would amend the definition of newspaper in state law to include online news outlets. That bill would require the New Jersey Press Association to maintain a free website with links to public notices. 
Zwicker’s bill would “bolster the civic function of public notices by diversifying news media that can cover notices, thus increasing the online audience that will encounter these notices,” Ainsworth said. 
“Maintaining the public notice function exclusively with independent, third-party news media ensures that proper notice was given by both governmental and private parties. Allowing public notices, even if only partially, to be fulfilled by government on government websites erodes trust of government,” he said.

Ned Lamont made an unplanned endorsement of Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York on Monday, saying he'd rank Cuomo first on a ballot.","Gov. Ned Lamont made an unplanned endorsement of Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York on Monday, ignoring the wishes of a top aide who tried to keep him focused on less contentious things — say, the veto of two bills backed by his own party.
At the end of a press conference on his veto of an omnibus housing bill and another that would have provided jobless benefits to strikers, the subject of the former New York governor’s comeback came up.
“If you lived in New York City, would you rank Andrew Cuomo on your ballot tomorrow?” asked Mike Cerulli of WTNH News 8. “He’s your former colleague.”
“I worked with him pretty constructively. I’ll just leave it at that,” Lamont replied.
Lamont worked with Cuomo throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, navigating how to deal with President Donald Trump during his first term when the president both downplayed the health threat — and threatened to quarantine Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
The pair once fished together in New York, and Cuomo visited Lamont in Hartford.
But endorsing Cuomo, who resigned in August 2021 over a barrage of sexual harassment complaints, would have little upside for Lamont if he runs for another term. And Lamont clearly had no plan to endorse him, even as some prominent Democrats have slowly glided back to Cuomo’s orbit.
Bill Clinton endorsed Cuomo, his former housing secretary, on Sunday, an effort to hold off Zohran Mamdani, a young state lawmaker and Democratic Socialist who has risen in the polls in the Democratic mayoral primary.
But message discipline never has been a strong suit for Lamont.
On Monday, the questioning in Lamont’s office turned from Cuomo and back to the topic of affordable housing. But the governor was pressed again about answering the Cuomo question.

Rob Blanchard, the governor’s communications director, already had announced an end to the press conference, an admonition ignored by the press — and governor.
Blanchard tried again to nudge the press to the door.
“All right, thanks everyone,” Blanchard said.
“Assert yourself, Rob,” Lamont said, laughing.
No one moved.
“You don’t want to say you’re endorsing Andrew Cuomo?” asked Chris Keating of The Hartford Courant.
“That’s not a story,” Blanchard said.
“It’s the biggest election in the country,” Cerulli said. “Many view it as a referendum on the future of the party. You’ve weighed in on that.”
“If you ask me who I’d vote for, I’d vote for Andrew Cuomo,” Lamont replied.
“You’d rank him first?”
“Yeah.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday published a new permanent administrative rule to guide how election observers are allowed to conduct themselves at polling places. 
On Friday, the commission voted 5-1 to approve the rule after more than two years of work that involved the participation of a 24-person advisory committee made up of municipal clerks, poll workers, political parties and outside groups including advocates for people with disabilities and right-wing election conspiracy outfits. 
The final rule order specifies who is allowed to observe elections and defines the boundaries of what observers are allowed to do at a polling place. The rule also dictates when poll workers are allowed to call law enforcement to diffuse a situation and includes provisions to require that observers be allowed to use available chairs and restrooms and for how the news media is allowed to operate inside polling places. The rules are different for members of the media, who are allowed to take videos and photos inside polling places while observers are not.
WEC commissioners of both parties advocated for the passage of the rule, arguing that while not perfect, the compromise reached to create the rule was better than the vague interpretation of state law that had previously governed observers. 
But even after their involvement on the advisory committee, election skeptics opposed the rule’s enactment. WEC commissioner Robert Spindell, a Republican who has often flirted with election conspiracy theories, was the lone vote against the rule going into effect. 
Republican lawmakers on the Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) had denied the passage of an emergency rule instituting similar provisions earlier this year. JCRAR deadlocked on a vote to deny the permanent rule’s enactment in April, allowing it to move out of the committee and back to WEC for final approval. 
“Today marks a significant milestone that will ensure election observers, election officials, and voters all have a clear and consistent understanding of the observer process,” WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe said in a statement. “After years of thorough public hearings, advisory committee input, and careful drafting, this rule enshrines standards for election observers that ensure participation in our electoral process.”
The commission will hold a meeting later this year to approve new guidance for election clerks administering the rule, according to a news release. The rule is set to go into effect Aug. 1.

Michelle Lujan Grisham joined leaders from other western states and U.S. territories Monday in publishing a report that proposes government solutions to make housing more affordable across the region.
A group of bipartisan governors joined Lujan Grisham for the opening news conference of the annual Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe.
As the organization’s chair, Lujan Grisham has for the past year led its push to expand lower-cost options for places to live.
The report offers fixes for what it says are zoning and land use laws that impede housing development, slow and complicated permitting systems, not enough financing tools for affordable housing, high home prices and too few construction workers.

During the news conference, Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called the report a roadmap for how western state governments can catch up on building workforce and affordable housing, including using public lands.
She pointed to state-owned land at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque, where New Mexico is “moments away” from announcing the results of a competitive bidding process for hiring a master planner who will oversee multi-use development there.
“We are looking at moving the fair and redeveloping a brand new revitalized housing and community neighborhood initiative there,” Lujan Grisham said. In April, she signed legislation giving state officials authority to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds and take other steps to develop the land.
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican and the association’s immediate past chair, said issues like housing, water and fire resource management have come to the fore with many people moving to the West.
When the states and the federal government come together, Gordon said, “there really are no problems that we can’t successfully address.”

South Dakota’s Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he’s impressed with the reception governors have received from the second Trump administration, however, he believes the country’s problems will not be solved in Washington but rather by state governments.
“I’ve been encouraged that we’ve got cabinet secretaries in place, a number of them that are very willing to work with the governors to find solutions,” Rhoden said.
Several Trump-appointed leaders are scheduled to speak to Western Governors’ Association this week.
When asked about the proposal in Congress for some public lands to at least be nominated to be sold and used for housing, Lujan Grisham said the notion that we don’t need any public lands is likely to be a “non-starter” in New Mexico.
“The process that has been described so far is a problem for a state like New Mexico wherein our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness and they belong to all of us,” Lujan Grisham said. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he hopes the federal government includes states in a search for federal land that could be used for housing or other uses.
“Coloradans really treasure our access, and it would be a devastating blow to the quality of life, as well as to our economy, if areas were fenced off and the public was denied access,” said Polis, a Democrat.
One of the recommendations in the WGA’s housing report is for Congress to consider legislation to allow agencies beyond the U.S. Forest Service to lease some federal lands for affordable housing used by federal workers and local communities.
“With the concentration of federal lands in the West, leveraging certain parcels for responsible housing development is an additional strategy to address affordable housing shortages,” the report states.

In the months following her mother’s violent death, Pam Martin Harris has found herself questioning God. 
She told lawmakers as much in winter, asking them to make a change. She walked them through the story of her mother’s homicide — and the violent abuse of her corpse that followed. Police found evidence that the 82-year-old’s body had been sexually assaulted and set on fire after her death. 
“In my faith, I have concluded that this was the act of the devil,” Martin Harris said. 
She urged representatives in the House Committee on Judiciary to support a bill that would make it a felony charge to abuse a dead body, a penalty that has never existed in Vermont. Lawmakers in committee started working on the bill, and after the measure made its way through both chambers with near unanimous support, Gov. Phil Scott signed it into law May 22.

Before this year, Vermont law only covered grave robbing and unauthorized burials. It never criminalized the mutilation, incineration or assault of a corpse.
The state should not have waited until 2025 “to cover something of that magnitude,” said Rep. Penny Demar, R-Enosburgh, one of the bill’s lead sponsors. Martin Harris’s testimony made it clear the law was needed, he said. 
Roberta Martin was first reported missing by neighbors who went to check on her at her Enosburgh house one morning in July 2024. Police deemed her disappearance suspicious and were unable to locate her remains until days later. Then, Martin Harris learned her mother’s foot had been found — and her body burnt beyond recognition, she told lawmakers.

“I felt completely broken. The horror that she must have felt was haunting,” Martin Harris said. 
When a loved one goes missing and their family is left in limbo for days or months, holding out hope, “the additional trauma on top of the loss is really unconscionable,” said Jennifer Poehlmann, executive director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services.
Poehlmann, who supports Martin’s family, declined to comment on their case. Martin’s family declined an interview. 
When a loved one’s body is mutilated, assaulted or incinerated, the family is not able to have the peaceful goodbye they envisioned, Poehlmann said. 
“The closure you never get is unnerving,” Martin Harris told lawmakers. “It’s a void and an ache that’s constant.”
In the days, weeks and months that followed her mother’s death, neighbors were haunted too, said Demar, who represents the town in the Legislature. 
“They were sleeping with the lights on,” he said. 
Demar used to teach a hunter safety course. After Martin’s death, his phone kept ringing, with people in town asking him about gun ownership, he said. 
The new law validates the experiences of survivors by offering a stiffer punishment for the brutality inflicted after the victim’s death, Poehlmann said.
Under the law, set to take effect July 1, dismembering, burning or otherwise abusing a corpse carries up to 5 years in prison, up to a $5,000 fine or both. If the abuse is sexual or for the purpose of concealing a crime, the felony is enhanced to at least 15 years in prison, up to a $10,000 fine or both. 
Burial of a corpse without a proper permit is no longer a crime, but rather a civil penalty up to a $1,000 fine. 
The law also gives prosecutors an added legal tool, Poehlmann said. If a corpse is mutilated, police may lack sufficient evidence to charge the alleged assailant with murder, she said. Or, in a case where one person committed a murder and another person mutilated the body, this law would allow both people to be charged. 
Poehlmann said she is alarmed that there are a number of cases, either recently resolved or still in court, in which someone accused of murder also mutilated the victim’s corpse. Because those cases predate the new law, those people will not face additional charges for any abuses after the victim’s death. 
If anything, Demar worries the law might not go far enough. 
“It’s a savage crime,” he said. “I think these people should be put away for a long, long time.”

What do changes to federal law mean for the bird?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “What could Trump’s changes mean for CT endangered species?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act, which was passed during the Nixon administration in 1973. Could you explain what the law does and how President Trump wants to change it? You’ve used the situation of the piping plover in Connecticut, for example.
JES: Broadly, it set up a structure for protecting species that were at risk for some sort of difficulty, whether it’s a threat to their habitat, or just an overall threat or endangerment that might be visited upon them by development or drilling or, you know, fill in the blank. Over time, they’ve proven to be one of the biggest factors in terms of threats to wildlife. And I should say parenthetically, we’re talking mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, fish, marine mammals, marine fish, and we are talking plants. So we’re talking about a lot of things here.
WSHU: So, pretty much what the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does, and the National Marine Fisheries Service does, right?
JES: Yes, the National Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries do. They kind of jointly run this, although the National Wildlife Service has most of it. What the Trump administration is endeavoring to do is something that they actually signaled in Project 2025, they were going to do. And as we’ve seen now, you know, they followed Project 2025 pretty closely. They want to eliminate habitat as part of the definition of what it means to harm a species of any sort. And what has raised all kinds of ire over is, as I indicated, this is what most folks see as the key factor in causing species harm, threatening endangerment, you name it. An example here in Connecticut might be something like the piping plover, which we’ve all heard about, the small shorebirds that need a certain amount of shoreline that is above the tide line that provides them with the kind of food they need, and people to stay away from them.
WSHU: And what we’ve been doing is fencing off those areas, right?
JES: Yes, a lot of those areas where they breed have been fenced off. On the coastline, it’s been fenced off. But here’s the thing: the habitat is still at risk. And the habitat in this particular case is at risk, really, from climate change, which has brought in sea level rise, stronger storms, and it shrunk and shrunk and shrunk that habitat. So, where will these guys go? There isn’t enough room. One of the things I could see when I was in an area where they had some of these nests fenced off was that you could see where the high tide line had come through the fencing. Well, sooner or later, as sea levels continue to rise, assuming the world, the U.S., doesn’t take any, you know, really definitive action here. It’s just going to overrun the habitat. Well, where will these birds go? And that’s just, I mean, that’s just a single issue of why habitat is important. I mean, going back years and years and years, if you think out west, with the spotted owl fight over logging, and that was going to take away their habitat for nesting and everything else. Almost any species you can think of, habitat really plays a critical role. There are a few exceptions, but habitat is the big one.
WSHU: The Trump administration is drilling down on the word take. It says to take means to capture, kill, or trap. It doesn’t mean protecting the habitat. How are they arguing this?
JES: Well, in that list, you listed a few of the words in that list, but the key word is harm, and harm has been not just interpreted, but it’s been litigated in the Supreme Court in the past not just to mean kill, but to harm them in other ways, one of which is loss of habitat or degradation of habitat, and that’s what they’re going after. It’s the word harm in particular in that set of items related to the word take.
WSHU: Okay, so if there are environmental changes because of the Trump administration policies. Is there anything the state can do? What do we have as state protections for endangered species in Connecticut?
JES: Connecticut, along with other states, but by no means lots of states, has its own Endangered Species Act in place. Whatever the Trump administration does, it’ll have a tangential impact on what Connecticut decides to do, but it’ll have some impact, and the state will not have to change its own laws. Our Endangered Species Act lists gobs and gobs of species that it considers endangered, and a rung down threatened, or another rung down species of concern, and there are state regulations in place. Some shoreline towns, in particular, have some local zoning rules and other kinds of rules in place. But where you run into trouble is when you have species that sort of run in interstate ways. An example I was given is something called a Bog Turtle, which New York also has. Well, it’s on the federal list. It’s also on the state list. But if New York does something that would impact what happens in Connecticut, we as Connecticut would not really have the ability to say, ‘Hey, New York, stop doing that.’ But the Feds would.
WSHU: The environment doesn’t respect state boundaries, the ecosystem and the larger ecosystem?
JES: Yeah, no. I mean, we’re all in ecosystems, and they interact in many different ways, and the habitat is one. Suppose the habitat is degraded to a point that whatever species is there can’t live there. Well, if you’re a freshwater fish or in a muscle that is in Connecticut, well, how do you move? It’s fresh water. Now, if you’re a marine mammal, you can move to cooler waters. If you’re a bird, you can move. But you know, the vegetation that you eat, or the species in the water that you may eat, or the insects that it may eat, will they move in time? These things have to sync up. I should also say we have an example here in Connecticut and throughout a lot of the northeast, you know, one type of animal that is definitely endangered that doesn’t have to do with habitat. Those are bats, any number of types of bats. The State of Connecticut, on its list, has a whole mess of them. The feds for our area have two. They suffer from a disease, something called White Nose Syndrome. They got plenty of habitat, but we have this disease that we haven’t figured out a way to get rid of yet.
WSHU: The state of Connecticut wants some more species added to the federal list. What’s happening with that?
JES: The big one here is something called a salt marsh Sparrow. Again, this is habitat-related, not unlike the piping plover, which nests way down in the salt marsh. The piping plover nests are slightly higher, but the Marsh sparrows nest way down in the salt marsh. And if we’re having even a full moon, high tide or increased sea levels or a bad storm, those nests can wash out very easily and the Center for Biological Diversity actually petitioned the federal government some time ago to add that to the federal list. They were told by a different administration that fish and wildlife was going to add it. It never happened. The Center for Biological Diversity said to me that they really don’t think the Trump administration will do anything about it unless the center takes the administration to court.
WSHU: Bottom line is that Connecticut officials are trying to get local communities more involved. Could you just tell us a little bit about that? And is that an anecdote to what could possibly change on the federal level?
JES: It can certainly help. What the Audubon Connecticut has done, using its its own foundation money the past couple of summers, is coordinate with Stratford and West Haven to help train local officials on how to understand what’s going on with the shorebirds and be cognizant of that if you know they notice something untoward at the beach, it builds on a lot of regulations that shoreline towns already have, really to protect people and the beaches themselves. Don’t bring dogs on the beach, don’t make fires on the beach, no ATVs on the beach, but Audubon Connecticut points out that these regulations, while they’re good for people, also happen to be good for some of the wildlife. But police officers, for instance, who monitor this stuff may be, you know, completely uninformed of the regulations that are on the books and the issue of endangered species on the beaches. So if they see a fire on the beach, they would now know, not only do I deal with the people who set the fire, but let me go check for the birds, because it’s nesting season.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Piping-Plover-fledgling-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

Commission members said in their emails to colleagues that the body was ”undercut” and ""never fully embraced"" by the Legislature and its role in new legislation did little to convince them otherwise.

Two members of the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont, including the commission’s chair, announced last week they would be resigning, saying they no longer believed their efforts would make any impact.
Meagan Roy, the chair of the commission, and Nicole Mace, the representative of the Vermont School Boards Association, both announced they would be leaving the commission in June 19 emails to fellow commissioners viewed by VTDigger.
Both members said the commission’s refined role, as laid out in the landmark education reform bill approved by the Legislature last week, H.454, does not give the commission the power to inform or influence the state’s efforts to reform public education policy.
“Even with the revised charge of the Commission, I cannot in good faith dedicate my professional time and energy to a body that I can’t be certain will be legitimately part of the work moving forward,” Roy wrote.

Likewise, Mace, who serves as the vice chair of the Winooski School District Board of Trustees, wrote in her email that the commission was “never fully embraced” by policymakers since its creation during the 2024 legislative session.
“I supported the basic framework for education reform that was built in the House-passed version of H.454,” she wrote. “But what has transpired since then has revealed this process of reform will go down the same path as many failed reform efforts of the past — carve-outs for powerful interests, last-minute deals based on political expediency and not what what’s best for the system, and a disregard for the educators who show up every day and do extraordinary work on behalf of the children of our state.”
Mace added that she “cannot continue to participate in a process that sacrifices equity and accountability in favor of power, privilege, and political games.”
Roy said in a phone interview that independent schools were the only group lawmakers prioritized and protected when they crafted the bill. 
“What we’ve witnessed is a process that’s become very political and driven in that way, not driven by good education policy,” she said. 
The resignations come as Gov. Phil Scott waits for legislative lawyers to finalize the language in the education reform bill, which he is expected to sign. The bill calls for a radical transformation of Vermont’s public education system over several years by consolidating the state’s 119 school districts and creating a new education funding formula.
The Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was first created as part of 2024’s Act 183, the law that set the double-digit average property tax increases needed that year to keep pace with ballooning public education costs.
The law established the 13-member body, composed of lawmakers and education officials, and tasked it with studying Vermont’s public education system and making recommendations to reduce costs while ensuring equal educational opportunities for all students. The commission must create a final report due in December.
But the commission, Roy wrote in her resignation letter, was “undercut” in January when Scott released his own sweeping proposal calling for the consolidation of Vermont’s 119 school districts down to as few as five regional administrative districts.
From then on, the commission lacked buy-in from all sides of the political spectrum, and members were uncertain of the point of the commission, according to commission members.

READ MORE

In H.454, lawmakers gave the commission room to “work closely” with the state’s School District Redistricting Task Force, which is expected to begin meeting in August to craft new school district configurations, according to the bill. 
The task force is expected to utilize the commission’s public engagement efforts “to maximize public input regarding the development of the proposed new school district boundaries,” the bill states.
The bill also tasked the commission with making recommendations to the Legislature about what roles and powers should remain at the local school district level versus what should move to the state level. The commission, the bill reads, should also recommend “a process for a community served by a school to have a voice in decisions regarding school closures and recommendations for what that process should entail.”
In an interview, Roy said these remain critical questions to answer, but “we don’t have evidence to suggest that the General Assembly actually wants our opinion.”
“There’s not a track record to demonstrate the commission will be listened to,” she said.
It was not immediately clear who would replace Roy and Mace, or serve as the chair. Their positions on the commission are listed as vacant on an agenda for a future meeting.
Roy in her resignation letter said she will be “focusing my professional energies on supporting school districts and school leaders as they navigate the uncertainty to come.”

For the first time since 2019, House and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement on joint rules to guide their work in the legislative session that began six months ago.
The post House, Senate say they have agreement on joint rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR THE FIRST time since 2019, House and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement on joint rules to guide their work in the legislative session that began six months ago.
House Speaker Ronald Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said late Monday morning that negotiators had come to terms on a new set of rules and that the final compromise language would be made available later Monday.
“At the beginning of this session, we committed our respective chambers to deliver a transparent and efficient legislative process that meets the moment,” Mariano and Spilka said in a statement. “This agreement draws on key provisions from each chamber’s original proposals, and represents our shared commitment to creating an accessible and productive Legislature that responds to the concerns of our constituents and delivers for Massachusetts.”
Democrat negotiators have failed to agree on a final package of joint rules in each of the prior two sessions, leaving the House and Senate operating under 2019-era policies extended on what was supposed to be a temporary basis.
This year, Democrats in both branches moved to enact significant changes to the way they work together, saying they want to increase legislative transparency and efficiency after a particularly chaotic summer last year. Lawmakers failed to finish significant work by the usual July 31 deadline, but eventually got many priorities across the finish line during a time of year that had been off-limits for major lawmaking for decades.
Almost two hours after Mariano and Spilka announced the agreement, lead negotiators Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem and House Majority Leader Michael Moran provided greater details of their accord.
“This bipartisan effort reflects a shared commitment to enhancing transparency, improving legislative efficiency, and ensuring accessible and accountable lawmaking for the people of the Commonwealth,” a fact sheet provided by Creem’s office said. “Among the reforms are longer public notice periods for hearings, mandatory committee hearing livestreaming and archiving, an earlier reporting deadline for joint committees, the recording and posting of committee votes, new requirements for bill summaries, and rules ensuring more timely public access to conference committee reports.”
Public hearings of joint legislative committees must be announced 10 days in advance, up from the current three days, and those committees will be required to produce a complete schedule of hearings within three weeks of committee appointments. All committee votes are to be publicly posted online.
Once bills are in committee and get a hearing, Senate and House committee members will vote only on bills filed in their respective branch. That has been the practice so far this session, and the change has given senators (who are outnumbered on joint committees) a greater ability to advance legislation without necessarily getting buy-in from representatives.
Bills filed by someone other than a member of the Legislature (the governor, for example), so-called money bills that get filed in the Senate, and amendments to the Constitution filed in the House will continue to be voted on by both House and Senate committee members.
Joint committees will be required under the proposed rules accord to act on legislation no later than the first Wednesday of December of the first year of the two-year session, moving the bill-reporting deadline about two months earlier than its current place on the calendar on the first Wednesday in February of the second year of the session. Under House rules, committees must act on bills filed in the House no later than 60 days after the bill’s hearing, with an additional 30-day extension available at the discretion of the chair.
The proposed joint rules agreement would also allow the Legislature to meet in formal sessions after its traditional end date of July 31 in the second year of the session, but only to take up reports from conference committees formed on or before July 31, appropriations bills filed after July 31, and gubernatorial vetoes or amendments.

Shri Thanedar – calling for the Trump administration to halt the use of the Guantanamo Bay prison facility for migrant detention.
In a letter sent Monday to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Tlaib (D-Detroit) and her colleagues also called for the permanent closure of the facility.
“We write to express our outrage at the ongoing and recently proposed expansion of detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay,” the letter said. “For over two decades, Guantánamo Bay has been synonymous with injustice, torture, and Islamophobia. President Trump’s decision to hold thousands of immigrants – many of whom are asylum seekers and refugees – in a facility notorious for human rights abuses is morally abhorrent and unlawful.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Aside from Thanedar (D-Detroit), the letter was also signed by notable Democrats in Tlaib’s orbit, like U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
“These detention facilities at Guantánamo should have been closed years ago,” the lawmakers wrote. “It is unacceptable that not only are they still operational, but they are being repurposed for yet another generation of unjust detention. As long as the United States maintains a detention facility at Guantánamo, future administrations will continue to use it to try and deprive non-citizens of meaningful access to the courts and the full protections of U.S. and international law.”

A wide swath of anti-torture, immigration and other social advocacy groups endorsed the letter, including Amnesty International USA, Human Rights Watch, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the National Immigrant Justice Center.
“We call on the administration to immediately halt the use of Guantánamo for migrant detention, close the detention facilities for good, and ensure that all detained individuals are treated with dignity, due process, and the protections guaranteed under both U.S. and international law.”
The other Democratic members of Michigan’s Congressional delegation – U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) – did not sign the letter, nor did any member of Michigan’s Republican delegation.
The letter is unlikely to have any tangible effect either within the Trump administration or the Republican controlled U.S. House and U.S. Senate.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/guantanamo-1024x511.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 18:05:13.665381

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Washington’s congressional delegation was divided along party lines in reacting to President Donald Trump’s decision to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend. 
Democrats largely criticized the president’s decision. They said he should’ve consulted Congress and suggested he’d put the U.S. at risk of getting drawn into another protracted conflict in the Middle East. 
Washington’s two Republicans in the House applauded the move, pointing to Iran’s ambitions to build nuclear weapons.
On Monday, Iran responded to the U.S. attack by firing missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Below is a roundup of lawmakers’ statements.
The Senators
(Murray and Cantwell are both Democrats)
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray:
We can all agree that Iran should never possess a nuclear weapon. But the American people do not want to begin a war with Iran, and Trump does not have the unilateral authority to start one. 
This strike was unconstitutional. I share the questions the American people have. What is the strategy here? Why are we putting American lives at risk? The administration must now do its utmost to ensure service members and civilians in the region are protected against retaliation. 
The United States of America is a democracy with constitutional separation of powers, and that requires a president — any president — to come to Congress to approve the use of military force.
Full statement
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell:
The United States should work to do everything it can to avoid a larger war with Iran or a larger Middle East conflict. It requires working with our allies and the international community to move towards diplomatic solutions that ensure that Iran is no longer a state sponsor of terrorism and national security threat. 
Congress should work to pass the Enhanced Iranian Sanctions Act. Congress must also reassert its constitutional authorities to head off future reckless or shortsighted Presidential actions on issues of war and trade. The United States must rebuild the international coalition of allies and partners forged under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and build on it by penalizing countries that break international sanctions and buy Iranian oil at discounted prices. 
Full statement
House Republicans
U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner:
There is no greater threat to the world than nuclear proliferation, let alone from a regime that has consistently used radical Islamic terrorists to attack and kill Americans for nearly 4 decades. I fully support President Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuke reactor. Trump gave Iran a choice. The Ayatollah chose poorly. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse:
The decisive actions taken by the United States come as Iran refused to end development of their nuclear program, and I stand with our ally Israel as we work together to end this dangerous regime’s efforts towards a nuclear weapon of mass destruction. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. 
Full statement
House Democrats
U.S. Rep. Adam Smith:
(Smith is the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee)
I condemn in the strongest terms the President’s decision to order the U.S. military to strike Iran’s nuclear sites. The President did not seek authorization from Congress or demonstrate that Iran posed an immediate threat to the security of the United States. Furthermore, the President failed to provide clear objectives for these actions and there are no guarantees that it will eliminate the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon or how long it might set their program back.
Engaging in direct conflict places U.S. service members and military sites in the Middle East squarely in the crosshairs of Iran and its many proxies. Tonight’s actions could further escalate tensions, destabilize the region, and drag the United States into an avoidable war.
The way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and to protect American service members is through diplomacy and negotiation, not entering into direct conflict. The path that the President has chosen risks unleashing a wider war in the region that is both incredibly unpredictable and treacherous and that threatens the safety and security of the United States, Israel, and ultimately the world.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene:
Trump’s strike against Iran was unconstitutional. Under the Constitution, Congress has the explicit power to declare war and authorize military force. 
These actions risk drawing the U.S. and our service members into another war in the Middle East, without explanation.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen:
The history of military conflict in the Middle East is that conflicts are difficult to contain and never seem to end. The Administration’s decision to unilaterally intervene in the Israel-Iran war by bombing Iran’s nuclear program sites will drag the United States deeper into the Middle East without a clear end game.
The United States must now focus on protecting U.S. forces in the region, coordinating with allies to share intelligence regarding Iranian or proxy retaliation, and seeking a return to diplomacy.
Diplomacy has always been the best way to impose long-term limits on the Iranian nuclear program, like the multilateral agreement President Obama achieved before Trump unwisely pulled out of it. It remains unclear how much damage the strike did to the Iranian nuclear program infrastructure.
Congress must reassert its authority and oversight over Trump’s military decisions and not be cowed into approving a bloated Pentagon budget using this attack as a pretext.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal: 
The authority to declare war belongs solely to Congress. Trump’s unconstitutional and escalatory strikes risk drawing US troops and the American people — who are overwhelmingly opposed — into another forever war. Congress must immediately exercise our duty to restrain this President. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier:
President Trump’s unilateral decision, made without proper consultation with Congress, will have widespread consequences that we cannot predict.
We know Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism around the world and must never possess a nuclear weapon. There is no guarantee that yesterday’s actions will permanently achieve that goal, and none of us want the U.S. pulled into another endless war in the Middle East that puts our country and brave servicemembers at extreme risk.
We must do everything possible to de-escalate and foster lasting diplomacy, peace, and stability in the Middle East. 
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Emily Randall: 
President Trump’s decision to circumvent Congress to attack Iran is as unconstitutional as it is terrifying. This decision has put our service members, the American people, and innocent civilians in the region at significant risk — with no clear objective and no plan for what comes next.
We can have political differences — that’s a core principle of our democracy. But what we cannot tolerate is the abuse of power — and our constitution mandates that no president can take military action without the approval of Congress.
While we can agree that Iran should not have nuclear power, we do not need another endless war or more families getting knocks on the door that their loved one is gone.
Full statement
U.S. Rep. Marilyn Strickland:
The Islamic Republic Guard (IRG) of Iran must be stopped in its quest for nuclear weapons. They are the most prolific state sponsor of terrorism — supporting and funding Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. For the 40+ years the IRG has ruled Iran, they have abused and terrorized their own people, and stated that they seek to destroy Israel and the United States.
Peace and stability in the region must now be the priority through multinational diplomacy and thoughtful negotiations. President Trump’s action on Iran has dangerously escalated tensions and put American lives at risk.

The private university, located in Sioux City, announced in a news release Friday that Mosley will leave the university on June 30 to take on the role of president at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Chad Benson, chair of the board of directors and a Morningside alum, will work as the interim president for the next two years.

“Serving as President of Morningside has been a tremendous honor,” Mosley said in the release. “This is a place full of blessings, promise, and heart. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together and deeply grateful for the support of the board, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and this incredible community. I know Morningside is in great hands and will continue to flourish into the future.”
Mosley started as Morningside’s president in 2022, the release stated, and during his time at the university he led efforts to modernize technology across campus and expand academic programming, such as initiating a fundraising campaign that would add a business school to the college’s offerings.
According to the release, the board will use the two-year period of Benson’s interim presidency to explore “long-range strategic opportunities and timing for the university’s next presidential search.” Former board chair and current trustee Curt White will step into the role once again during this period.
White said in the release Benson is the right choice to lead the university during this transitional period, with his longtime relationship to Morningside and his leadership and strategic skills.
“Dr. Mosley has served Morningside with energy, grace, and an unwavering belief in our mission,” Benson said in the release. “We thank him for his impact and wish him the very best as he begins a new chapter. Morningside is in motion—and we remain laser-focused on delivering an experience that equips students to thrive in a complex world through innovation, character, community, and purpose.”

(Getty Images)The Idaho Behavioral Health Council is asking for the public’s help in identifying priorities for spending the state’s share of funding from a settlement agreement with opioid manufactures.
The fund from the settlement agreement provides about $2 million per year for opioid abatement programs and activities in Idaho, according to a press release issued Monday by the Idaho Behavioral Health Council.
Under the agreement, 40% of the settlement money goes to the state, 40% goes to participating cities and counties and 20% goes to public health districts.
Millions of dollars to combat opioid abuse are coming to Idaho

The council’s job is to recommend spending priorities to Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Legislature, and the council is asking for public feedback and ideas before developing the spending priorities. 
The Idaho Behavioral Health Council published a list of potential opioid abatement strategies online that the public can provide feedback on.
Potential strategies include expanding availability of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanding telehealth to increase access to treatment for opioid and substance abuse disorder, providing additional supports like housing, child care, transportation, education and job placement to people in treatment, ensuring health care providers screen for opioid use disorder and more.
Anyone in Idaho may make recommendations, suggest priorities or offer feedback by sending an email to IdahoBehavioralHealthCouncil@idcourts.net by July 31. 
The Idaho Behavioral Health Council is scheduled to determine its spending priorities during its upcoming Aug. 22 meeting.
More information about the opioid settlement agreement is available on the Idaho Behavioral Health Council’s website.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)The 19-year-old counter-protester arrested at the Nashville “No Kings” Rally for brandishing a firearm now faces a federal charge for unlawful possession of a firearm.
Federal authorities say Elijah Millar of Murfreesboro violated a court-ordered conservatorship that restricted his access to firearms.
The Rutherford County Chancery Court appointed an emergency conservator for Millar in 2023, finding him “at risk of substantial harm to his health, safety and welfare,” according to court documents. Another Chancery Court judge found Millar to be a “disabled person needing care” in September 2024 and issued an “Agreed Order of Limited Conservatorship” that restricted his access to firearms, according to the federal criminal complaint.
If convicted on the federal charge, he faces up to 15 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
Nashville police arrested Millar at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park on June 14 after rally attendees notified police that he “was involved in heated arguments and spitting at people when he pulled out a gun that he pointed toward the ground, placing witnesses and others in the crowd in fear,” according to Metro Nashville police. 

Nashville police seized a 9 mm pistol from Millar, court documents state.
Millar was wearing a black hat and mask, sunglasses, fingerless gloves and a bright yellow tie, and carried a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag. He was charged with disorderly conduct and his bond was set at $1,500.
Davidson County General Sessions Court does not list an attorney of record for Millar.
Three days later, Murfreesboro Police Department Criminal Investigations Division detectives arrested Millar on three counts of carrying or possession of a weapon related to incidents on June 16 and in April 2025, according to a department news release. 
Police responded to a West Murfreesboro home after online reports alleged that Millar made suicidal statements, according to Murfreesboro police. Responding officers found a loaded 9mm handgun in Millar’s waistband and Millar was taken to the hospital for evaluation. 
Millar was charged on June 17 after being discharged from the hospital for violating the terms of his  conservatorship, according to Murfreesboro police.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation Joint Terrorism Task Force assisted Murfreesboro police in serving the warrant on the home. 
Millar is being held without bond at Rutherford County Adult Detention Center ahead of a July 21 hearing in General Sessions Court.
Millar is also scheduled to appear in Davidson County General Sessions Court on July 25.
“The right to peaceably protest government action is guaranteed by the First Amendment and cannot be infringed upon by armed individuals whose actions put people in danger,” Robert E. McGuire, acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, stated in a news release. “Our efforts to hold firearm offenders accountable are designed to keep all members of the public safe from potential violence.”

(Photo by No New Letcher Prison)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to claw back $500 million for a prison in Letcher County, a project that has been subject to stops and starts for nearly two decades. 
A Justice Department budget request dated June 13 proposes to rescind construction funding for a medium-security prison in Roxana for the upcoming fiscal year that starts in October. 
It’s not the first time a federal administration has tried to ax funding for the proposed prison that Republican U.S. Rep Hal Rogers has worked to bring to Letcher County since 2006. 
The first Trump administration killed a plan for a high-security prison on the site, calling the hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the project “wasteful spending” at a time when prisoner numbers were declining. A Biden administration budget also proposed canceling funding for the prison.
But in 2022, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) under the Biden administration switched the plan to a medium-security prison. The bureau moved forward with acquiring land for the project last year after a process to determine its environmental impacts.  It’s funding for the medium-security prison that the Trump Justice Department now is seeking to rescind. 
Rogers, a long-time advocate for the prison project, in a statement provided to the Lantern, said the Letcher project would address the prison bureau’s need for modernized facilities and that he secured the $500 million in federal funding as a key appropriator in Congress.
Rogers, in his 23rd term, sits on the powerful U.S. House Appropriations Committee and leads a subcommittee overseeing funding for the U.S. Department of Justice that includes funding for federal prisons. 
“The people of Letcher County have invested nearly 20 years of planning and preparation for a new federal prison to bring more than 300 much-needed jobs to our region,” Rogers said in his statement. “The proposed prison has surpassed multiple environmental studies and every ounce of red tape that has been doled out. Years of investments have been made in good faith to support this project at the federal, state and local levels, and I will continue working to see it to completion.” 
An email requesting comment from the Justice Department about the funding recission was not immediately returned Monday afternoon. The Lexington Herald-Leader had previously reported on the proposed funding rescission. 
The proposed prison project has also faced pushback from a coalition of local and national activists seeking to stop the project. The progressive think tank Kentucky Center for Economic Policy has also questioned economic development arguments made in favor of the prison, highlighting other Eastern Kentucky counties with prisons that have seen economic and population declines. 
In January, an Indigenous group backed by the coalition of activists announced it had purchased land within the boundaries of the proposed prison project and sought to use the land for other purposes. Rogers had said the move came as no surprise “from a group led by Kentucky outsiders and liberal extremists.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22a92b_a77a331b6b7b4a90ab4d3addb30b15a6mv2.jpeg-2048x1095-1-1024x548.webp,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, responds to the governor's State of the State Address during a press conference afterwards on Jan. 14, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Democratic state Sen. Fred Love said Monday that he is running for Arkansas governor.
In a statement, Love said his campaign will focus on “protecting public schools, empowering communities, and driving inclusive economic growth across the state — especially in rural and underserved areas.”
“We can either stay on the path that sidelines our kids, weakens our schools, and silences our towns — or we can choose a future that values every student, every community, and every small business owner,” the southwest Little Rock lawmaker said.
Love is the second Democrat to announce intent to run against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2026. Businessman Gary Huskey of Blytheville announced his plan to run last month.
Sanders is so far the only announced Republican candidate for governor, and the state party last week made challenging her harder than before by raising the candidate filing fee from $15,000 to $40,000, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The party’s executive committee also raised the fee to run for U.S. Senate from $20,000 to $40,000.
Love’s announcement of his gubernatorial plans follows his wife’s announcement in early June month that she will run for his District 15 Senate seat next year.  Love is term-limited and cannot run for reelection. He served in the House of Representatives from 2011 through 2022 and was elected to the Senate in 2022.
ShaRhonda Love is one of three women who have said they will run for the open Senate seat. State Rep. Tara Shephard, who represents southwest Little Rock’s District 79 in the House, announced last month, and Charity Smith-Allen, wife of state Rep. Fred Allen of Little Rock, announced her candidacy last week.
In Monday’s announcement, the senator unveiled an economic development plan for sustainable growth throughout the state. The plan includes:

Establishing regional economic development hubs tailored to local industries and workforce needs.
Expanding access to startup capital, infrastructure, and grants for small businesses.
Partnering with HBCUs, community colleges, and high schools to align education with job creation.
Investing in broadband, water, and utility infrastructure to make every community business-ready.

“We must stop measuring progress only by what happens in a few cities,” Love said. “Prosperity should be visible in our Delta towns, our Ozark communities, and our Main Streets—not just in spreadsheets.”
Primary elections next year will take place March 3, and the general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Love.Collins2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

(Courtesy of Virginia Railway Express)Virginia Railway Express CEO Rich Dalton will retire from the commuter rail service in the fall, the operations board announced on Friday.
Dalton’s retirement will go into effect on Oct. 3. Board members will be responsible for creating a search and selection committee for his replacement.
“It’s time. It may not ever be a good time, but it’s time,” said Dalton briefly on Friday.
  Virginia Railway Express CEO Rich Dalton (Courtesy of Virginia Railway Express)
Dalton led the system through its planning process for the 2050 System Plan and Vision. The plan aims to assist officials in responding to evolving travel patterns, particularly those of commuting office workers, which have changed significantly over the past decade.
According to VRE, the recently adopted plan aims to transform rail in Virginia by shifting VRE from a “commuter-focused rail service to a more regional operation with the eventual addition of bi-directional and weekend service, responding to shifting passenger needs and bolstering economic growth throughout Northern Virginia and surrounding jurisdictions.” 
VRE connects Central and Northern Virginia with the District of Columbia. The system’s two lines, Manassas and Fredericksburg, serve 19 stations, including two – L’Enfant and Union Station – in D.C.
Dalton’s long-standing involvement with VRE goes back to 1992, when he worked with local automotive manufacturer Morrison-Knudsen, now known as Wabtec, since the commuter rail service launched its first trains.
Dalton joined the system as chief operating officer in 2009 before stepping in as interim in 2019 and then permanent CEO in 2020. During his tenure, he managed multiple projects to develop the system and its resilience amid changes including ridership.
Under his tenure, the system also navigated through periods of instability, including the pandemic, which continues to impact ridership and budgets across the region. VRE said the system “maintained high rider satisfaction with no substantial impacts to operations during the pandemic.”
The projects he helped lead included implementing technology to automatically prevent train accidents caused by human error, extending VRE service to Spotsylvania County in 2015 and maintenance plans to minimize costs.
“If nothing else, Rich’s legacy would be a legacy of safety,” said board chair Sarah Bagley on Friday. “I think that’s a legacy we’re very proud of, is the role that you have placed in making sure everybody is as safe as they can be with your organization.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has signed onto a legal brief alongside 22 other attorneys general to support lawsuits brought by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio that are attempting to block federal funding cuts to their organizations.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS, stating in the order that “neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens”.
Since then, NPR and PBS filed two separate lawsuits arguing the funding cuts threaten the First Amendment and create public safety hazards for citizens served by their local affiliates who rely on public media for weather, health and safety alerts.
Forum highlights cost defunding public media has on emergency alerts, educational programming

The brief Nessel and other attorneys general filed last week backs the arguments made by public media and warns of the harm that could come from weakening public media programming and infrastructure.
“Public media is a vital source of independent information for countless Michiganders and Americans, especially in rural communities, where it is often the only option available,” Nessel said in a news release Monday.
Law enforcement depends on public media when issuing AMBER Alerts to find abducted children, as well as Silver Alerts for missing elderly individuals or individuals with developmental disabilities, the legal brief outlines. Public broadcasters provide critical coverage of emerging public safety threats like active shooters, especially in news deserts where public media may be the only resource to quickly disseminate information, the brief adds.
The public media stations in Michigan, many serving rural communities outside of many news outlets’ coverage areas, also provide emergency information that help residents navigate extreme weather of other crises, Nessel’s news release said. 
“Attempts to defund public journalism are a blatant attack on the press and the First Amendment, and a disservice to the people who rely on it every day,” Nessel said. “Public radio reaches nearly every corner of our state, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues and with public media in defense of this essential news source.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City is gearing up to host a historic parade Tuesday to celebrate the city’s first NBA championship. 
The roughly two-mile long parade, which is expected to draw thousands of fans, will begin at 10:30 a.m. at Northwest 10th Street and North Harvey Avenue will wind its way through downtown Oklahoma City before ending at Scissortail Park.
Officials say the parade, which commemorates the Oklahoma City Thunder’s first NBA championship, is expected to last one and a half hours. The Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games Sunday night to win the NBA Finals. 
“The day of the parade will forever live in the annals of our city’s history,” Mayor David Holt said in a statement. “It is a celebration of our team’s historic accomplishment and our city’s renaissance.”
Streets surrounding the parade route will be closed. Additionally, most city services will not be available Tuesday,  including city offices, trash collection, municipal court, the Household Hazardous Waste Collection Center and Animal Welfare. Oklahoma City streetcars will not operate until the parade ends.
“Conducting city business in person downtown will be almost impossible on parade day, so I decided to close,” said Craig Freeman, the city manager, in a statement. “Closing will also make more parking available for the thousands of people attending the parade.”
He said utilities, parks and public works crews are needed to support parade operations.
City parks outside the downtown area, summer camps, gymnasiums, pools as well as community, recreation and senior centers will operate as normal.
The Oklahoma City’s Office of Emergency Management is coordinating the public safety planning for the parade. 
Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Dillon Quirk said there are no credible threats, but urged attendees to stay as close to family as possible, especially if children are present. A multitude of officers will be present and on standby.
The parade will also be streamed on the Thunder mobile app and on YouTube at OKCThunder.

,DC,2025-06-23 20:23:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate mega-bill drops requirement states help pay for SNAP program,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-mega-bill-drops-requirement-states-help-pay-snap-program,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats have succeeded in eliminating more than a dozen policy changes from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” after successfully arguing before the chamber’s parliamentarian that the elements didn’t comply with the strict rules that go along with writing a budget reconciliation bill.Removed is language that would have transferred some of the cost of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments, potentially leaving states on the hook for billions in added spending on the food aid program for lower-income people.Democrats also fended off a proposal to eliminate funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which fields complaints on banking and other financial institutions, and another that sought to bar federal district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. Among the contested items that remained, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley announced in a social media post that his years-long effort to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, or RECA, passed what’s known on Capitol Hill as the “Byrd bath” test.“Terrific news for Missouri, radiation survivors, and MAHA: RECA has passed the ‘Byrd bath’ - Democrats did not strip it - and will be in the final bill,” Hawley wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again slogan. “Huge step forward #MAHA.”Democrats to continue challengesBudget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., has cheered many of the parliamentarian's rulings, though Republican committee chairs say they’ll look for ways to rewrite the various proposals.“Today, we were advised by the Senate Parliamentarian that several more provisions in this Big Beautiful Betrayal of a bill will be subject to the Byrd Rule — and Democrats plan to challenge every part of this bill that hurts working families and violates this process,” Merkley wrote in a statement released Saturday night. “Republicans’ relentless attack on middle class families in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires is a slap in the face to working families everywhere, and Democrats are fighting back.”  The changes could create several issues for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and eventually for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who need nearly every GOP lawmaker in Congress to vote for the sweeping tax and spending cuts package in order for it to become law.The House voted 215-214 to approve its version of the bill in May, but since the Senate is making substantial changes, the House will have to vote on the measure again before it can go to President Donald Trump for his signature. GOP leaders hope to complete all that before the Fourth of July.Republicans are using reconciliation, instead of moving the bill through the regular legislative process, to avoid needing Democratic votes to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.But the lower threshold for passing a reconciliation bill comes with several requirements, including that all of the proposals in the package have an impact on spending or revenues that’s not “merely incidental.”The Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official scorekeeper who holds a detailed understanding of the rules and procedures, examines each of those policies and hears from both Republicans and Democrats before issuing the rulings.The Byrd bath began last week behind closed doors and will continue for at least several more days. Once it concludes, Senate GOP leaders can move the bill to the floor, where members of both parties can call for votes on as many amendments as they want.SNAP programAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., released a written statement defending his committee’s bill after the parliamentarian ruled several provisions must go to comply with the rules.“To rein in federal spending and protect taxpayer dollars the committee is pursuing meaningful reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to improve efficiency, accountability and integrity,” Boozman wrote. “We are continuing to examine options that comply with Senate rules to achieve savings through budget reconciliation to ensure SNAP serves those who truly need it while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”The parliamentarian ruled the committee erred in including language that would have shifted some of the cost of the SNAP program to state governments if they didn’t meet an efficiency benchmark before 2028.A proposal to eliminate SNAP eligibility for “immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents, with certain exceptions,” was also determined not to comply with the rules, according to a press release from Merkley.Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, ranking member on the committee, wrote the parliamentarian’s ruling “made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts.“While Republicans’ proposed cuts to SNAP will still be devastating to families, farmers, and independent grocers across the country, we will keep fighting to protect families in need. Instead of a rushed partisan process, Republicans should work with us to lower costs for Americans and pass a bipartisan Farm Bill that works for all farmers and rural America.”Consumer financial agency victory for DemsThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee’s proposal to eliminate funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Congress established in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also doesn’t comply with the rules, under the parliamentarian’s ruling.Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ranking member on the panel, wrote in a statement that the GOP’s proposal for the CFPB represented “a reckless, dangerous attack on consumers and would lead to more Americans being tricked and trapped by giant financial institutions and put the stability of our entire financial system at risk–all to hand out tax breaks to billionaires.”But committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., wrote in a separate statement that he remains “committed to advancing legislation that cuts waste and duplication in our federal government and saves taxpayer dollars.”Scott listed provisions that he said will remain.“As it stands now, the Banking Committee’s reconciliation provisions will delay the implementation of Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank, which reduces CFPB spending and protects the privacy and data of small business owners; rescind unused funds earmarked for green initiatives to give HUD discretion in funding critical housing programs; and save taxpayer dollars by eliminating an unnecessary reserve fund at the SEC,” Scott wrote. “My colleagues and I remain committed to cutting wasteful spending at the CFPB and will continue working with the Senate parliamentarian on the Committee's provisions.”Judges and injunctionsThe parliamentarian told lawmakers that various elements of the Judiciary Committee’s bill don’t comply with the rules, including an attempt to block federal district court judges from issuing nationwide preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders.The issue has become a thorn in Trump’s side during the past few months as he’s watched the courts block several of his executive orders and other unilateral administration actions.The Judiciary Committee’s reconciliation bill cannot block the Department of Justice from awarding Byrne JAG and COPS grants to “sanctuary cities.” The bill also can’t send funding to local and state governments for the purpose of “apprehending aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States.”Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, did not respond to a request for comment, but a committee spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “Democrats are clinging to their radical open borders legacy by fighting to keep criminal migrants in the United States.“Republicans are committed to enforcing the rule of law, and will continue using all available avenues to secure our borders, clean up the mess left by the Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous policies and ensure courts operate according to lawful and constitutional standards.”Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking member on the committee, issued a statement calling the bill’s policies ""an attempted power grab by our Republican colleagues that we would not stand for.”""Here’s what Senate Republicans attempted to sneak into their so-called Big, Beautiful Bill: a provision intended to limit the ability of individuals and organizations to challenge lawless Trump Administration executive actions by putting those potential plaintiffs on the hook for millions of dollars; and a provision conditioning grant eligibility on a state or locality’s compliance with federal immigration policies,” Durbin wrote.Artificial intelligence and statesThe parliamentarian didn’t, however, remove all of the proposals contested by Democrats.Language that would prevent local and state governments from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade if those jurisdictions want to receive money from a $500 million fund does meet the reconciliation requirements and can remain in the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation’s bill.But that doesn’t mean the provision will stay in the bill moving forward, since several GOP lawmakers have expressed concern about potentially tying the hands of local and state governments when it comes to AI.Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote in a social media post after she voted for the House’s bill that she had no idea about the AI provision. That chamber’s package barred state and local AI regulation for a decade without tying it to any funding stream.“We have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,” Greene wrote. “This needs to be stripped out in the Senate.“When the OBBB comes back to the House for approval after Senate changes, I will not vote for it with this in it.”",,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

(Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)A new poll shows Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani gaining on Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday’s New York City Democratic mayoral primary, and Ron DeSantis is concerned.
“I’m not a political prognosticator, not knowing what will happen in that mayor’s race that’s going on right now,” he told reporters and onlookers at a press conference in Clearwater Beach on Monday.
“But I will tell you, if that leftist does win, you’re going to see Palm Beach real estate go up another 20%. That will happen very quickly. Because as bad as some of what they’ve had, this is like [Bill] De Blasio on steroids.”
“That leftist” DeSantis wouldn’t or couldn’t name is a Queens state assemblyman who has overtaken Cuomo in the final round of ranked-choice voting in the Democratic mayoral primary election, according to a Emerson College, PIX 11, and The Hill survey released Monday.
DeSantis’ comment about more New Yorkers retreating to Palm Beach if Mamdani does win echoed comments made last week by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. She told a television station that she opposed Mamdani’s proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy, saying, “I don’t want to lose more people to Palm Beach. We’ve lost enough.”
More than 151,00 New Yorkers fled to Florida between 2018 and 2022, according to data from the Citizens Budget Commission, a New York fiscal watchdog group. A net of 30,000 New Yorkers fled the city to either Palm Beach or Miami-Dade counties in that period, taking with them a combined $9 billion in income.
“I follow these things because it affects us,” DeSantis continued. “When the current Chicago Mayor [Brandon Johnson] got elected, Naples real estate went up because it’s like they had bad and they elected worse, and so some people would say, ‘We’re just going to get out of Dodge.’”
The general election for mayor of New York City takes place in November.

(Jack Yen Joy Photography | Getty Images)Proposed cuts to Medicaid in Congress’ budget reconciliation bill would have “detrimental” effects to communities in West Virginia, the head of a state rural health organization told reporters Monday.
Seven rural hospitals in West Virginia would be at risk of closure if the cuts to health care in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” become law, Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Care Association, said Monday.  
That number includes one independent, rural hospital in West Virginia, according to a report released Monday by Families USA, a national nonpartisan organization that advocates for health care consumers. 
Sutphin said the cuts would affect a rural, independent hospital in central West Virginia that is the sole provider of primary and emergency care for six or seven counties. The hospital, which he did not name, also operates an emergency medical service and a skilled nursing facility, he said.
“If this hospital were to close, those communities in those seven counties comprising thousands of West Virginians would lose access to all of those services,” Sutphin said. “So not only are they losing access to primary care, losing their Medicaid coverage, and probably delaying treatment for things like diabetes and heart disease, which are precursors for heart attacks and strokes, they’re going to lose access to emergency medical services to get them to tertiary care centers. 
“So these types of cuts are really going to be detrimental to communities within West Virginia with real impacts, and almost immediately,” Sutphin said.
Sutphin’s comments came during a press call Monday hosted by Families USA.
Nationally, about 400 rural, independent hospitals in 26 states are at risk of closing if the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” is signed into law, the report says. 
“Many rural independent hospitals are already facing tough times, many with negative net revenue, and this bill would push many more into the red,” Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, said in a statement Monday. “These proposed Medicaid cuts and coverage terminations could be the final blow for many independent rural hospitals across America. Medicaid is often the biggest line item in these rural hospitals’ budgets, and reducing those paying patients and increasing uncompensated care, on top of direct cuts, would be devastating.” 
The U.S. House of Representatives last month narrowly passed a version of the bill that would cut Medicaid by more than $700 billion — the largest in the program’s history. The bill would impose work reporting requirements and cause roughly 15 million people to lose their health care coverage over the next few years, analysts say.
The Senate version of the bill would cut Medicaid even more and expand the proposed work requirements for the program.
A report earlier this month from the Sheps Center for Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that more than 300 rural hospitals, including seven in West Virginia, are at risk of closure because of cuts in the bill. 
Rhonda Rogombé, health policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the additional paperwork requirements the bill contemplates would cause people to lose their health coverage, despite otherwise qualifying for the program. 
“This will impact entire communities… hospitals in West Virginia that rely on Medicaid are at risk of closure, and when a hospital closes, that impacts everybody, not just enrollees and Medicaid,” she said.
West Virginia Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, both Republicans, have said they support work requirements for the health care program. 
“Biblically, you’re supposed to work,” Justice reportedly said in an interview with The Independent. “We have taken the dignity and the hope and the belief away from a lot of people where they are hopeless, they think they can’t. “
In a recent interview with CNBC, Capito said those who need SNAP or Medicaid benefits should get them, but said there are people on the programs who don’t qualify.
“But what’s happened here is there are people on those benefits, both benefits programs that don’t deserve to be on there or don’t qualify and have stayed on for years and years for one reason or another,” Capito said. “We need to flush that out. Get rid of the waste, the fraud, the abuse of the system so that it is there for the basic folks who need it.”
Rogombe said the changes to the Affordable Care Act provisions in the bill will have a significant impact in West Virginia. The Senate bill would raise costs for people enrolled in plans through the state’s health insurance marketplace by failing to extend tax credits set to expire at the end of the year. 
“We will see the uninsured rate, which has been historically low for since the adoption of these flexibilities within the ACA plan, we will see historically high uninsured rates again, and that will have devastating impacts on quality of life in our state,” she said.

Ned Lamont sided with suburban towns and Republican legislators who had urged him to nix H.B. 5002 as an intrusion into local zoning.,"Gov. Ned Lamont ended nearly three weeks of public rumination and private negotiation about the fate of an omnibus housing bill Monday, siding with suburban opponents and Republican legislators who had urged a veto of the measure as an intrusion into local zoning.
Lamont, a Democrat whose overwhelming reelection in 2022 came on the strength of suburban support, praised the goals behind House Bill 5002 and decried much of the opposition as based on misrepresentations, yet he ultimately bowed to those concerns.
“I think we can make it better. I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities. And I think the vast majority of those communities want to do the right thing,” Lamont told reporters in a press conference in his office at the state Capitol.
Lamont also confirmed a veto of Senate Bill 8, legislation that would have provided jobless benefits to striking workers, consistent with statements he repeatedly made prior to passage. The deadline for acting on the two bills was Tuesday.
But his public skepticism about House Bill 5002, a measure his administration helped negotiate, was recent and unexpected. It blossomed since the legislature adjourned June 4, and opponents led by CT169Strong and the conservative Yankee Institute raised alarms and urged local officials to demand a veto.
“There are about 2,000 bills, and I focus on probably a half dozen,” Lamont said, responding to questions pressing him to explain his short path from support for a priority of the legislature’s Democratic majority to a veto demanded by its GOP minority. “I probably should have focused on this one sooner.”
HB 5002 was drawn to address a critical housing shortage by requiring municipalities to set “fair share” goals for affordable housing, prioritizing state aid to communities that build housing, and streamlining approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Lamont said the community-by-community “fair share” goals for affordable housing were “a planning document,” not a mandate as opponents claimed, yet those false claims contributed to his veto decision.
“I think this, you know, crossed the line for a lot of folks, in particular, when it comes to dictating or suggesting the number of units you ought to have,” Lamont said. He clarified the bill does not dictate the number of units a community should produce.
Housing advocates found his answers confounding. They noted his administration was privy to the bill’s development, and the governor acknowledged he was acting on opposition talking points that he largely discounted as based on misrepresenting the details of the 41-section bill.
“That’s absolutely astounding,” said Erin Boggs, the executive director of the Open Communities Alliance. “The governor’s office was directly involved in negotiating this bill. His specific complaints about target numbers for each community to plan around appear based more on complaints from municipalities and NIMBY advocates who do not understand what the bill says rather than legitimate issues with the proposal, and should not have been enough to trigger a veto.”
Equally confusing, Boggs and other advocates said, was that the principle for going forward appeared to be finding a consensus from officials in municipalities whose zoning either bars multifamily housing of three or more units or requires special permitting. That consensus, they said, has been elusive for decades.
“Thousands of working-class and middle-class people can’t afford to rent or own a home in Connecticut, making this veto disappointing and short-sighted,” said Melvin Medina of the Connecticut Project Action Fund. “Nixing this bill suggests a lack of urgency and a commitment to steady habits that aren’t delivering results.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, defended the “fair share” provision as a necessary prod to act on providing affordable housing.
“I have no regrets about fighting for these families. It was not dumb, and it was never wrong to be a champion for their cause,” Rojas said. “Housing reform is hard. It’s even harder in the world of social media outrage machines that exploit the currents of the moment, flooding feeds with disinformation and scare tactics. But we do not give up because it is hard. We press on because it is necessary.”
Lamont called his veto “reluctant” and called for stakeholders, including municipal officials, to craft a new version in the next 90 days. Without committing to any, he praised some of 5002’s provisions, such as one that would have required zoning regulations to allow small middle housing projects in commercial zones “as of right.”
“Commercial ‘as of right’ makes really good sense to me,” Lamont said. “Rather than have an empty, underused office building, people can convert that, do that, you know, more quickly and readily. But I think we have to do it the way that people buy in.”
Lamont tweaked Republican legislators, who voted as a bloc against the bill, as inconsistent when it comes to encouraging growth and bemoaning bureaucracy. Those attributes, he said, disappear when it comes to housing.
“It’s sort of interesting to me that Republicans are usually the ones that are pro-growth and want to get rid of the red tape and over-regulation,” Lamont said. “Instead, in this case, it’s the Republicans who are sort of slow growth and very happy with the local regulation.”
But Lamont retreated towards a posture of deferring to local control.
“I’m not happy with the local regulation. I’m not happy with the, you know, the local red tape, but I want the towns to take the lead,” Lamont said.
He drew a distinction between “the veto crowd” and the “people of goodwill” who oversee planning and zoning.
“The veto crowd, they don’t have any solutions. They don’t have any constructive  solutions. They’re saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to win them over,” Lamont said. “But I think when it comes to our towns and cities and first selectmen and planning and zoning people, people of goodwill who know how important it is for our towns and our state to continue growing, we’re going to get it done.”
Lamont had no detailed answers on what, if anything, the state should do regarding communities that do not, in his words, “buy in” to changes that encourage the construction of affordable housing or streamline processes that can stretch for months or even years.
He viewed those reluctant communities as a minority, and overall he saw Connecticut making progress — an assessment not shared by the housing advocates.
“The data is clear: decades of exclusionary zoning have severely limited the production of homes, particularly the more diverse types of homes our population needs in the places they need them,” said Desegregate Connecticut, an affiliate of the Regional Plan Association.
Connecticut ranks 49th in housing production and has the lowest vacancy rate in the U.S. About 50% of renters and 30% of homeowners are “cost burdened,” spending at least 30% of household income on housing.
Republicans praised the veto.
“Let’s now go back to the drawing board, work together across the aisle and find real bipartisan solutions that address housing affordability — without gutting local control,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “Our towns and cities deserve a seat at the table — not a mandate from Hartford.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, offered praise and criticism.
“The governor made the logical call by vetoing H.B. 5002, though he has offered little vision for a path forward,” he said. “Trying to make housing more affordable in Connecticut without confronting the broader policies that drive up the cost of living here is a flawed strategy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 17:04:39.271404

There were 4,155,487 Florida residents enrolled in the program as of May 30, the latest available data. That’s 68,110 fewer people since December 2024 and 643,662 fewer people than in January 2024.
Florida’s Medicaid caseload was at an all-time high in state fiscal year 2022-23, when total caseload for the safety net program was 5,575,548. The following year, the total caseload dropped by 13.3% to 4,836,670. Economists predicted there would be 4,226,199 enrolled in the program for state fiscal year 2025-26, which starts July 1 and ends June 30, 2026.
Legislators relied on those estimates when drafting the FY 25-26 Medicaid budget. That budget earmarks $36.53 billion to the state Agency for Health Care Administration, the agency that houses Florida’s Medicaid program.
Florida requires most of its Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans. As such, a breakout of Medicaid enrollment data shows that about 72% of the beneficiaries belong to a Medicaid managed care plan, or 3,006,980 as of May. Enrollment in managed care plans is down by 7,682 from January and 453,638 people from January 2024.

John Cavanaugh of Omaha speaks with reporters after the core legislative proposal seeking to help implement medical cannabis stalls in committee. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who in early June joined the race to replace U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., announced over 20 endorsements Monday of his bid in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
Cavanaugh, the son of a Democratic congressman in the Omaha area in the 1970s also named John, quickly secured the endorsements of two prominent Democrats who have served as Nebraska governors and U.S. senators, Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson. 
“I am supporting John Cavanaugh because I know that John will be able to hit the ground running and has a proven record of standing up for people in Nebraska,” Nelson said in a statement.
Cavanaugh also grabbed endorsements from seven current state senators, including as State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha. He also secured the backing of former state senators and some elected officials in Omaha and Douglas County, including Omaha City Councilman Danny Begley and Douglas County Commissioner Jim Cavanaugh.
Earlier this month, former Omaha State Sen. Tony Vargas — who narrowly lost twice to Bacon in the Omaha-based 2nd District race — endorsed political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell’s Democratic bid.
Powell had previously announced endorsements from some Cavanaugh colleagues in the Legislature, including from Omaha’s State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca, in addition to other elected officials in NE-02, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and parts of suburban Sarpy County.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey lawmaker wants to bar the disclosure of state legislators’ home addresses after a gunman killed Minnesota’s House speaker and left another lawmaker critically wounded earlier this month.
Assemblyman Chris DePhillips’ proposal would add legislators to the list of officials whose personal information is shielded under Daniel’s Law, which currently prohibits the publication of home addresses of judges and law enforcement personnel.
“We need to do something on our end to protect public officials who have made the step to serve the public,” DePhillips (R-Bergen) told the New Jersey Monitor. “The least we can do is not just protect them but to protect their loved ones, protect their children, protect their grandchildren who are not public officials and should not literally be caught in the crossfire.”
On June 14, a gunman fatally shot Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home. Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were critically wounded during a second attack by the same gunman.
Federal and state authorities have charged Vance Boelter with murder over the shootings. Officials have said Boelter, posing as a police officer, drove to the homes of two other lawmakers who were unharmed.
Daniel’s Law was enacted in New Jersey after the attempted assassination of U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas and named after her son, Daniel Anderl, who was killed during the attempt on her life.
Officials across the span of government — from judges to legislators to law enforcement personnel — have for years warned that violent threats against them were on the rise and have, at times, urged more protections for personal information that could be used to aid such targeted crimes.
 Assemblyman Christopher DePhillips said shielding the home addresses of state lawmakers would not only protect them but also their families from being “caught in the crossfire.” (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
“It’s certainly something I think that we should consider extending to legislators in light of the tragedy we saw unfold in Minneapolis,” said DePhillips, who was visiting family in Minneapolis just minutes away from the shootings last weekend.
The assemblyman’s effort to bar the disclosure of lawmakers’ addresses isn’t the first.
In 2022, Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) sponsored legislation that would have shielded the addresses of elected officials and candidates for public office from disclosure on documents obtained through the Open Public Records Act. Then in 2023, the Legislature amended its ethics code to allow lawmakers to leave primary and secondary residences belonging to them or their immediate family off the financial disclosure forms they are required to file annually.
Greenwald’s proposal, which did not use Daniel’s Law as a framework, won unanimous approval from an Assembly committee but did not advance further.
“I hate to say that we were prophetic on this, but I saw the trend two years ago, and that trend has only gotten worse,” said Greenwald, who knew Hortman through work at the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
At the time, the Municipal Clerks Association of New Jersey warned of logistical hurdles to implementation.
There was no statewide registry of current and former elected officials, Kim-Marie White, then the association’s president, told legislators in 2022. White said then that requiring candidates’ and officials’ addresses to be redacted on documents returned in answer to records requests would be “a freaking nightmare.”
“I’m sure we can put our heads together and address those issues,” DePhillips said.
Kim Macellaro, the clerks association’s second vice president, did not return a request for comment on the new legislation.
DePhillips’ proposal is narrower than Greenwald’s, applying only to legislators, though Greenwald on Monday said the two bills were substantially similar and could be merged into a single, bipartisan plan.
“I’m glad Chris is thinking this way. I’ve known Chris for 35 years, so it doesn’t surprise me. He’s a good person, and I’m excited to try to get something done,” Greenwald said.
State legislators account for an exceedingly small share of the state’s elected officials, and their identities are more easily tracked than local officials spread through New Jersey’s more than 500 municipalities. But there are still hurdles to shielding their addresses.
Candidates for the Legislature — including incumbents seeking reelection — are required to disclose their addresses on forms filed with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. Language in existing law would allow redactions of documents filed with the election commission — which span decades for some lawmakers — once Daniel’s Law protections are extended to legislators.
Joe Donohue, the commission’s deputy director, last year urged tweaks to Daniel’s Law, warning the statute requires the Election Law Enforcement Commission to violate its own enabling legislation by mandating it redact addresses of some donors whose information is shielded by the law.
“We can technically hide the addresses of donors, but then what are we here for?” Donohue said last May. “We’re a disclosure agency. It’s just directly counter to our purpose.”
Office-seekers do not always include their home addresses on Election Law Enforcement Commission forms. Sometimes, they use a post office box or the address of a campaign staffer, typically the treasurer.

Hundreds of seniors across Delaware received free dental care this spring thanks to a partnership between Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware and United Concordia Dental.
The mobile dental clinics, held between April 22 and May 1, traveled to several locations including Dover, Lewes, Millsboro, New Castle, and Rehoboth Beach.
The initiative focused on Highmark Medicare Advantage members, offering essential services such as dental exams, x-rays, cleanings, and fluoride treatments—all at no cost.

“We are incredibly pleased with the positive response to these free dental clinics,” said Tom Fitzpatrick, president of Commercial Business for Highmark Health plans. “These events allowed us to directly address the oral health needs of our Medicare Advantage members and connect them with valuable resources for ongoing care.”
For seniors who required further treatment, the clinics also offered referrals to in-network dental providers.
Dr. Roosevelt Allen, Chief Dental Officer at United Concordia Dental, emphasized the broader health benefits of oral care.
“Taking good care of your teeth and gums can lead to better oral and overall health at every life stage,” said Roosevelt Allen, DDS, MAGD, ABGD, chief dental officer, United Concordia Dental. “That’s why we were pleased to partner with Highmark to bring these essential dental services to seniors in Delaware at no cost and help them be their healthiest.”

The attack — which Connecticut officials said involved a sow with cubs — is the latest in a series of bear encounters in the state in recent years that have prompted lawmakers to weigh solutions to the problem, including through a potential hunt.
After a series of debates, however, lawmakers adjourned their legislative session earlier this month without passing any significant bills addressing bear population management.
“Legislation will not prevent human-bear conflicts,” said state Sen. Rick Lopes, D- New Britain, who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Environment Committee. “But at the same time, if the number of conflicts are escalating, we should be doing something to address that.”
The incident in North Canaan occurred early Monday morning when the victim stepped between his dog and the bear, which had cubs present nearby, according to Department of Energy and Environmental Protection spokesman James Fowler.
The victim, who was not named by DEEP, sustained scratches to his chest and declined medical treatment at the scene. His dog was unharmed.
Fowler said state environmental conservation officers have set a trap in the area in hopes of capturing the bear. However, he said that a lack distinctive markings on the bear in question would make it impossible for officials to confirm its identity. 
Any bear caught in the trap will be taken in by wildlife officials and conditioned to avoid humans — using negative stimuli such as loud noises — before being released back into the wild.
Connecticut is home to between 1,000 and 1,200 black bears, with the population concentrated in the hills of Litchfield County in the northwestern part of the state.
As bears have expanded their numbers and range, however, they’ve come into increasing contact with farmers, suburban homeowners and even city dwellers. Last year DEEP recorded 67 home entries by bears, tying an all-time record.
Several attacks similar to the one that took place Monday have also fueled calls for a hunt. In 2022, a bear attacked and injured a 10-year-old boy in Morris, which is also located in Litchfield County. 
Opponents, however, argue that bear conflicts can be effectively reduced through nonlethal means, and by raising public awareness about limiting their access to food sources.
“The bears are coming around because they’re looking for food,” said Annie Hornish of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears. “Hunting is not an effective remedy.”
In a statement describing the incident, Fowler also pointed to the agency’s tips for avoiding conflicts with bears, such as securing trash in bear-proof containers and removing bird feeders during the summer and fall. There were bird feeders at the property where Monday’s incident occurred, he noted.
“Residents with pets or walking dogs in areas with known bear activity should also maintain high awareness of their surroundings,” Fowler said. “Carrying a bear deterrent, such as a bear whistle or bear spray, is recommended and we advise owners to keep their pets leashed, at all times, while on walks.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers considered a bill supported by DEEP to authorize a limited bear hunt that became subject to debate between members of the House and Senate. 
After an early version of the bill was pared back to focus on circumstances in which a farmer can kill a bear that is damaging crops or livestock, members of the Senate voted to add the hunting provisions back in. That prompted members of the House to make their own changes by again removing the hunting language and instead ordering DEEP to come up with a “bear management plan.” 
By that point, however, there were just a few hours left before the deadline for lawmakers to conclude their work and the bear bill died without a getting to a final vote. 
Lopes said he expects to resurrect the proposal for a hunt next year, and that it is more likely to pass if conflicts continue to escalate. 
“It was kind of a long-shot,” this year, he said. “Every year is getting closer.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-21-at-8.51.01-AM.png,,,2025-06-23 16:06:00.306880

It presents an opportunity to instill essential life skills, like financial literacy. This season is an ideal time for parents to introduce their kids to the fundamentals of money management, including saving, budgeting, and responsible spending. 
To help prepare for the year ahead, Chase is hosting a Back-to-School Family Finance event that will feature fun activities, financial health workshops, and more for kids of all ages. 

When—Saturday, June 28 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Where—Mississippi Civil Rights Museum (222 North St., #2205, Jackson, MS 39201)
What—Attendees will enjoy free haircuts, interactive games, and financial health activities designed for all ages to learn the importance of budgeting, smart spending, and the valuable resources available to them. Plus, while supplies last, students will receive a free backpack filled with school supplies.

In addition to joining Chase at the June 28 event, here are a few important lessons parents and kids can learn to help on the first day of school and beyond.
Start With Saving
Whether it’s allowance, gifts, or earnings from a summer job, teaching kids to track and save their money is essential in developing good financial habits. Saving toward specific goals and understanding the time it takes to reach those can help children grasp the true value of money.
Chase provides families with the tools and resources to make saving easy, like Autosave, by setting up automatic monthly transfers from your Chase checking account to your savings account. All managed through the ﷟Chase Mobile® App, parents can help their child set a savings goal to ensure they build a strong financial foundation. 
Next, Begin Budgeting 
As you approach the tween and teen years, financial needs and desires for independence will evolve. They might take on part-time jobs, save up for larger goals (like a car), and begin managing more of their own finances. This is a great opportunity for them to learn the basics of budgeting. 
Chase’s Monthly Budgeting Worksheets help make this process simple. Start by entering monthly income and expenses to help your teen differentiate “needs” and “wants.” This helps them see where their money is going and is important as they begin cashing and spending their first paychecks.
Then, Grow Their Finances 
Transitioning from high school to college or stepping into the real-world post-graduation comes with a new set of responsibilities. Amidst managing studies, jobs, and future planning, young adults need both guidance and practical tools to help.
The Chase Mobile app tracks earnings, savings, and expenses, and makes it easy to send and receive money with Zelle®.  
Just as kids progress from one grade to the next, they can grow their understanding and management of money too. Opening their first bank account is a great complement to these financial lessons. Check out Chase First BankingSM, Chase High School CheckingSM, and Chase College CheckingSM, to see which account works best for your student or, learn more at chase.com/StudentBanking.

In a 1998 ruling in Pro Choice Mississippi v. Fordice, the state high court said the state constitution provides Mississippians a right to abortion.
Late last year, a Hinds County judge ruled members of AAPLOG did not have standing to pursue a lawsuit to overturn the 1998 decision because they have not been harmed by the court ruling. AAPLOG, represented by new public interest law firm American Dream Legal, is appealing that ruling, and asking the state Supreme Court to “clarify whether Mississippi considers elective abortion a crime or a constitutional right,” according to a press release.
Based on another Mississippi case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the decades old Roe v. Wade right to abortion via the U.S. Constitution. The Mississippi Legislature has passed laws that prohibit most all abortions in the state and there are no clinics in Mississippi offering abortions. 
But the 1998 state Supreme Court decision holding that the state constitution provides a right to abortion has never been overturned and remains on the books. 
American Dream Legal in a statement said Mississippi’s criminal ban on abortion conflicts with the Fordice decision, and  this has AAPLOG physicians “caught between conflicting legal duties: refer patients and risk prosecution under state law — or refuse to refer and risk professional ruin.”
 “The people of Mississippi enacted a law that protected unborn life and took down the U.S. Supreme Court’s abuse of judicial authority in Roe v. Wade,” said Aaron Rice, attorney for AAPLOG and CEO of American Dream Legal. “It is only fitting that we likewise put an end to efforts by the courts in our own state to impose abortion by judicial fiat.”
In the Hinds County case, both the state, through Attorney General Lynn Fitch, and pro-abortion rights supporters argued that the doctors did not have standing. It’s unclear whether the high court will hear the appeal. In recent years, the state Supreme Court has taken a limited view of who has standing in various cases.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/07092235/18eea-justice-scalescopy.jpg,,,2025-06-23 16:06:00.306880

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER BEACH – Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Monday designed to provide financial relief to condominium owners who have faced serious financial strains from a tightened regulations enacted following the 2021 Surfside condo collapse in South Florida.
That tragedy, in which a 12-story condominium in northeast Miami-Dade County collapsed without warning, killing 98 people, prompted the Legislature to pass a law in 2022 that mandated that all condo developments undergo certain inspections — with condominium associations ordered to maintain sufficient reserve funds to repair maintenance problems revealed in those inspections.
To pay for those repairs, condo associations began tapping unit owners with expensive special assessments and higher monthly fees, leading to complaints from condo owners that they were being forced out of their homes because of those increased costs.
The legislative response (HB 913) signed by the governor on Monday allows associations to secure credit lines and invest funds to pay for building repairs instead of immediately raising large amounts of cash from owners. It carves out condos with only three residential stories from those inspections. And it extends the deadline for certain associations to have a structural integrity reserve study completed by Dec. 31, 2025, rather than Dec. 31, 2024.
“People need to be able to afford to live in these units and, especially if they’re getting assessments on things that maybe they do need to be done but it isn’t like the integrity of the structure is at risk here, they need to be able to work those out, and you shouldn’t have this mandate applied in that way,” DeSantis said while hosting a press conference at Island Way Grill on Clearwater Beach.
Earlier calls for this legislation 
The governor began calling for the Legislature to deal with the emerging problems resulting from the 2022 condo legislation last summer, but lawmakers resisted his efforts. Then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo said last August that the issue could be addressed during the regular legislative session, and she and outgoing House Speaker Paul Renner resisted a second request DeSantis made while holding a roundtable discussion on the issue in Pinellas County last September.
Flash forward to this January, when DeSantis again called on lawmakers to address the issue as part of a special legislative session that would also deal with immigration, reforms to citizen-led constitutional amendments, and hurricane relief. And again, the Legislature rebuffed his request.
“I know a lot of people were really disappointed in the leadership, particularly in the House of Representatives, for not being willing to address it at that time and, quite frankly, it didn’t look that promising through a lot of the legislative session,” the governor said Monday, before adding that the condo-owning public motivated lawmakers to pass something of substance this year.
“I think that this will provide some relief, but it’s also a very complicated set of issues that you’re dealing with, and if this legislation takes hold on July 1, hopefully we’ll see a lot of good things, but to the extent that there needs to be some cleanup next year when the Legislature reconvenes, we’d got to be willing to do that,”  he said.
“We all attempted to make sure that there was never a collapse again, like what happened at Surfside” said Clearwater Republican Sen. Ed Hooper. “We overreacted, probably, and now it’s time to make the change. People were losing their homes. Elderly people were losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase and their monthly HOA [home owner association] fees. That’s just wrong.”
Revisions to My Safe Florida Condo Pilot
DeSantis signed a second bill (HB 393) Monday revising the My Safe Florida Condo Pilot Project. The new law prohibits a condo association from applying for a grant or an inspection under the program unless it has complied with milestone inspection and structural integrity reserve requirements.
It now says that only 75% of unit owners, rather than 100%, must approve applying for the grant. It revises the roof improvements eligible for funding and clarifies that all grants under the program must be matched on the basis of $1 provided by the condo associations for every $2 provided by the state towards the actual cost of the program.
Ronni Drimmer is president of a condominium association board at a 55-plus community in Clearwater. She thanked the governor for providing relief for condo owners, but went a bit off script to say that she wished the legislation could do something about the high cost of property insurance at her building.
“At the moment, we don’t have hurricane insurance because they raised the deductible so high at $600,000,” she said. “Then it doesn’t really pay for insurance when a roof is only $500,000. So we’re in a little bit of a precarious situation right now, so I’m hoping something will be done about that.”
Along with Hooper, other Pinellas Republicans in attendance included state Sen. Nick DiCeglie and state Reps. Kim Berfield and Linda Chaney.

Mark Gordon and Northern Mariana Islands Gov. Arnold Palacios listen. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham joined leaders from other western states and U.S. territories Monday in publishing a report that proposes government solutions to make housing more affordable across the region.
A group of bipartisan governors joined Lujan Grisham for the opening news conference of the annual Western Governors’ Association in Santa Fe.
As the organization’s chair, Lujan Grisham has for the past year led its push to expand lower-cost options for places to live. 
The report offers fixes for what it says are zoning and land use laws that impede housing development, slow and complicated permitting systems, not enough financing tools for affordable housing, high home prices and too few construction workers.
During the news conference, Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, called the report a roadmap for how western state governments can catch up on building workforce and affordable housing, including using public lands.
She pointed to state-owned land at the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque, where New Mexico is “moments away” from announcing the results of a competitive bidding process for hiring a master planner who will oversee multi-use development there.
“We are looking at moving the fair and redeveloping a brand new revitalized housing and community neighborhood initiative there,” Lujan Grisham said. In April, she signed legislation giving state officials authority to issue hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds and take other steps to develop the land.
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican and the association’s immediate past chair, said issues like housing, water and fire resource management have come to the fore with many people moving to the West.
When the states and the federal government come together, Gordon said, “there really are no problems that we can’t successfully address.”
South Dakota’s Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he’s impressed with the reception governors have received from the second Trump administration, however, he believes the country’s problems will not be solved in Washington but rather by state governments.
“I’ve been encouraged that we’ve got cabinet secretaries in place, a number of them that are very willing to work with the governors to find solutions,” Rhoden said. 
Several Trump-appointed leaders are scheduled to speak to Western Governors’ Association this week.
When asked about the proposal in Congress for some public lands to at least be nominated to be sold and used for housing, Lujan Grisham said the notion that we don’t need any public lands is likely to be a “non-starter” in New Mexico.
“The process that has been described so far is a problem for a state like New Mexico wherein our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness and they belong to all of us,” Lujan Grisham said. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he hopes the federal government includes states in a search for federal land that could be used for housing or other uses.
“Coloradans really treasure our access, and it would be a devastating blow to the quality of life, as well as to our economy, if areas were fenced off and the public was denied access,” said Polis, a Democrat.
One of the recommendations in the WGA’s housing report is for Congress to consider legislation to allow agencies beyond the U.S. Forest Service to lease some federal lands for affordable housing used by federal workers and local communities.
“With the concentration of federal lands in the West, leveraging certain parcels for responsible housing development is an additional strategy to address affordable housing shortages,” the report states.

Dan McKee’s administration, with some practices receiving over $200,000 for recruiting new doctors and accepting new patients.  
Providers who saw some of the biggest boosts from the grants, which were made public last week, included all three of Thundermist Health Center’s locations. Thundermist’s awards ranged from $193,500 to $262,125, the highest overall grant in the batch. Other big grants include $257,625 for Care New England Coventry; $251,625 for Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, $250,500 for Wood River Health in Hope Valley and $212,625 for Brown Health’s Cranston location. 
The grants, which are being managed by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), opened for applications shortly after an April 29 press conference outlining McKee’s initiatives to repair the state’s ailing primary care infrastructure. At that press conference, state health officials said there were about 520 primary care providers in the Ocean State. The state would need about 300 more doctors to adequately cover the population, according to recent analysis of the All Payer Claims Database by Brown University researchers. 
“Primary care is the foundation of preventive care and overall positive health outcomes,” Richard Charest, EOHHS secretary, said in a June 18 statement. “These grants will support 85 primary care practices in Rhode Island to expand their practices so they can see more patients, which, in turn, will ease the burden on Rhode Islanders seeking access to primary care.”  
The grants are divided into three tiers. Applications for grants closed on May 16. The first tier grants went up to $75,000 and were available to practices that accepted between 25 and 75 new patients, depending on the practice size. Providers have until Oct. 31 to reach target numbers for newly enrolled patients. 
Tier two provides up to $300,000 for practices that recruit new primary care doctors, or established physicians who worked at now-closed practices. Practices have to document the hires and use of funds by year’s end.
Grants for the third tier required that practices enroll as new Medicaid providers in Rhode Island by Sept. 1. Tier three grants have not yet been announced and will be approved on a rolling basis, because the state needs time to verify a provider’s enrollment. The state has allotted a maximum of $100,000 for grants in this tier.   
McKee said in a statement that the grants are “central” to his administration’s goal of “building a healthier state for all” by 2030, alongside efforts to accelerate a review of the Medicaid rates paid to providers, require insurers to spend more on primary care reimbursement, ease prior authorization rules, and expand student loan forgiveness for primary care doctors.
The grants arrived the same week the General Assembly passed the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, which begins July 1. The budget also includes a strong emphasis on primary care by allocating $45 million toward providers, with $26 million of that infusion meant to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates by Oct. 1.
Low reimbursement rates for primary care doctors and an aging workforce of physicians have been cited as major contributors to the state’s primary care crisis. The closure of Anchor Medical Associates’ three offices — announced in April and to be finalized by June 30 — was another blow to general practitioners, leaving about 25,000 patients without a primary doctor.

The fledgling policy was being considered by the Cromaine District Library in Hartland, located in Livingston County near Howell, which raised eyebrows and tensions because many of the books being challenged in the library contain LGBTQ+ characters or themes.
Attorneys and advocates who voiced opposition to the policy said the sequestration of challenged books based almost exclusively on the anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs of some board or community members was discriminatory and a book ban in all but name.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Much like the battles over prohibiting library books or criminalizing them for minors that have played out over the last few years, activists and attorneys across Michigan have said that similarly sequestering or restricting access to books runs afoul of the First Amendment.
The board discussed the policy in June at a special meeting that saw some community members removed from the library and ended with a visit from the Livingston County Sheriff’s Department to make sure the meeting remained orderly.

Members of the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees on Thursday, June 19, backed off from the sequestration policy being discussed by the board since January. The board instead voted to adopt a policy that would simply label books found to contain extreme violence or graphic sexual content.
Sarah Neidart, director of the Cromaine District Library, told Michigan Advance that the policy allows for non-prejudicial, viewpoint-neutral labels, specifically crafted to notify patterns “that materials may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material as defined ‘by law.’”
“This was the conclusion of an effort by the board to work together to craft a policy that retains the right of local parents or guardians to restrict what their children read, rather than rely on staff to censor what a child may access in the library,” Neidart said in a statement.
The amendment to the policy can be found in Article 9, Section E.
“If the director determines the material may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material (as defined in the Appendixes), the material may be: relocated within the collection, and/or labeled with, ‘this book may contain graphic violence or sexually explicit material – Cromaine District Library,’” the amended policy reads.
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan told the Cromaine Library Board of Trustees that it was monitoring the situation and urged members against sequestration of challenged books or using labels to deter patrons from reading or seeing LGBTQ+ materials.
In response to the new policy adopted late last week, Jay Kaplan, a long-time staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan specializing in LGBTQ+ rights, told the Advance that it was important to understand how the library would define graphic violence and sexually explicit material.
“It’s probably legal and constitutional for a library board to have that authority, but we just want to make sure that it’s not misused,” Kaplan said. “Certainly, there’s been some comments by members of that library board that would seem to indicate that one might be concerned that it would be misused.”
Kaplan said the ACLU of Michigan and other groups would be watching closely to see how the labeling process unfolds.
“There’s been a number of books that … one person has complained about and those books feature LGBTQ+ characters and content,” Kaplan said. “Hopefully, this new policy won’t be used as a way to label books – not because they are graphically violent or sexually explicit – but because they contain [LGBTQ+] subject matter.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_190559-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 15:24:09.705318

Mike Braun speaks to reporters on June 19, 2025 from the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Economic Development Corporation’s board makeup will look different at Wednesday’s meeting following Gov. Mike Braun’s decision to replace the eight-member panel with nine new appointees on Monday.
In a release, Braun touted the expertise of his chosen men and women, saying they brought “experience from across the spectrum of Indiana’s economy” and aligned with the commerce secretary’s mission to grow wages and build new job opportunities across the state.
“I spent my life building a business here in Indiana, and I know that having an entrepreneurial, high-energy team in your corner makes all the difference.

The governor first shared the decision with reporters on Friday, saying that more information would be forthcoming.
The new members include:

Gus Olympidis, of Valparaiso, who owns Family Express Convenience Stores.
John Gregg, of Sandborn, a former Democratic House Speaker of the Indiana General Assembly and attorney.

Gregg ran for governor in 2012 against former Gov. and Vice President Mike Pence. He, again, ran in 2016 against eventual winner former Gov. Eric Holcomb.

Braun concluded the release by thanking the previous board members, saying their terms ended with the new appointments.
A new IEDC
With Commerce Secretary David Adams, Braun has vowed to reform the quasi-public state agency to increase transparency, especially in the wake of a forensic investigation. Changing the administration of the IEDC was a major topic on the campaign trail, which featured a former commerce secretary who oversaw the Lebanon LEAP project.

Linde, an industrial chemical manufacturer, announced Monday it will build an air separation unit to supply oxygen and nitrogen for the production of low-carbon ammonia at a plant next door, according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development (LED). Its customer is the Blue Point Number One complex, a joint-venture owned by CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui & Co. That $4 billion project is under development at the RiverPlex MegaPark.
Linde’s new project is expected to create 15 direct new jobs with an average annual salary more than 45% above the parish average wage, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates is $1,442 per week. 
“This announcement is yet another win for the West Bank as we build out the industrial base and bring high-wage job opportunities to the area,” LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois said. “For more than half a century, Linde has helped make Louisiana a global energy leader. Their latest investment reflects our shared commitment to optimizing our legacy sectors while driving our entire business ecosystem toward growth, innovation and global impact.”
Linde currently operates facilities in Geismar, St. Charles Parish, Vidalia, Lake Charles and Sulphur, as well as an extensive pipeline network across south Louisiana.
The company is expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs, incentives that will provide Linde with breaks on local property and state payroll taxes, respectively.

The passenger terminal at Wilmington Airport will be renamed the Thomas R. Carper Passenger Terminal Facility later this year, following a recent vote by the Delaware River & Bay Authority (DRBA) commissioners to honor the retired U.S. senator.
Approved through Resolution 25-28, the designation recognizes Carper’s more than five decades of public service in Delaware and his long-standing support of the DRBA and its infrastructure initiatives.
“On behalf of the DRBA, we’d like to recognize Sen. Carper for his steadfast advocacy and support of our organization throughout his career,” said Thomas J. Cook, executive director. 
“Upon the news of his retirement, it made perfect sense to acknowledge Sen. Carper, a distinguished member of the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame, by naming our renovated and expanded terminal facility in his honor,” he said. “From championing the DRBA’s 1995 acquisition of ILG, to relentlessly vying for grants to enhance infrastructure improvements and promote economic growth, Sen. Carper will forever be fondly remembered here at the DRBA.”
RELATED STORY: Expanded Wilmington Airport among DRBA’s $132.7M capital plan
Ben Clendaniel, AAE, director of airport operations, highlighted Carper’s role in strengthening Delaware’s only commercial airport.
Sen. Thomas Richard Carper served from 2001- 2025 as a US senator for Delaware.
“Sen. Carper’s love of flight and commitment to supporting aviation in Delaware was crucial in keeping Wilmington Airport competitive,” Clendaniel said. “As [it is] Delaware’s only commercial service airport, he recognized the airport’s importance of putting Delaware on the map by enhancing access to air travel for Delawareans and attracting new economic opportunities including aviation jobs to our region. Because of his dedication, we’ve been able to continually strengthen our ability to improve the customer experience and expand connectivity in our community.”
Carper, a former U.S. Navy flight officer who served three tours during the Vietnam War, began his civilian public service as Delaware’s state treasurer in 1977. He later represented Delaware in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1992, served two terms as governor from 1993 to 2000, and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2001. He retired from public office in January 2025.
RELATED STORY: 3 Del. airports split $9 million for expansion, renovations
Over the years, Carper played a central role in securing major funding for infrastructure projects tied to DRBA operations. In 2024, he helped obtain a $5.6 million grant through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Airport Terminal Program, which is supporting the ongoing $9.8 million expansion of the Wilmington Airport terminal. That project is expected to be completed this fall.

The lawmakers cite a Markup and CalMatters investigation that first revealed Covered California’s data practices in April.


Citing an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, lawmakers in the House of Representatives are questioning why California’s state health insurance exchange shared sensitive health data with LinkedIn.
In a letter sent last week to Jessica Altman, executive director of the state’s exchange, the lawmakers write they are “deeply concerned about the privacy and security implications” raised by a Markup and CalMatters story published in April.
The story showed through forensic testing how the exchange, Covered California, used trackers that told LinkedIn when visitors entered health information like whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications into the website coveredca.com. 
The trackers, which operated for more than a year as part of a marketing campaign before being removed, also logged information like whether visitors were transgender or possible victims of domestic violence.
Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrite, who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, sent the letter alongside four other Republican lawmakers. “The Committee seeks to understand how such sensitive data could have been transmitted through advertising trackers, what oversight existed to detect or prevent it, and whether Covered California took appropriate steps to protect consumer information,” the lawmakers wrote.

The other signatories are Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter of Georgia, who chairs Energy and Commerce’s health subcommittee; Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the oversight and investigations subcommittee; Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis of Florida and California Rep. Jay Obernolte. 
The letter said “the extended period of data exposure raises serious questions about the adequacy of safeguards that Covered California had in place.” Those “circumstances warrant examination of Covered California’s actions under federal privacy standards,” including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the letter continued. 
As part of the Affordable Care Act, states must offer health insurance through exchanges that allow residents to shop for and purchase health care plans. States can either let the federal government operate those exchanges or maintain their own, as California and 18 other states do. 
In California, millions of people rely on the exchange to find their coverage. But unbeknownst to those signing up for care, the exchange’s website used a tool called the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” that sent answers to potentially sensitive questions to the tech company. The tag is widely used for advertising purposes but LinkedIn explicitly prohibits using it to share health data.
In response to The Markup and CalMatters’ reporting, Covered California said the exchange had inadvertently shared the data and that it had instituted a review of practices. As the review happens, the organization said that it has paused its use of trackers entirely. 
The investigation immediately triggered an outcry. One House lawmaker asked in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services whether the practice may have violated HIPAA. A proposed class-action lawsuit against LinkedIn and Google alleging privacy violations was also filed one day after the story was published.
Since then, a followup investigation by The Markup and CalMatters found four other state exchanges also sharing information with tech companies. The stories were produced as part of a series called Pixel Hunt, examining the unexpected ways websites share data.
A spokesperson for Covered California said they had received the letter and planned to respond by the committee’s deadline of July 1st. A spokesperson for LinkedIn declined to comment.
The lawmakers asked Covered California to provide answers and documents in response to several questions about the organization’s data privacy practices, as well as its use of web trackers generally. The questions included what data was sent to LinkedIn, how many people were affected, and how or whether those affected will be notified.
“Ensuring the confidentiality of health information is a foundational obligation for entities operating within the health insurance ecosystem,” the lawmakers wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/042924_Covered-CA_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 15:24:09.705318

(Photo Courtesy of UW-Madison)Wisconsin Public Radio announced last week that it was laying off at least 15 staff members and cancelling four radio programs as the station faces budget shortages and the looming prospect of cuts to its federal funding. 
The staff members were notified of the layoffs on Friday and the cancelled programs include the nationally syndicated “To the Best of Our Knowledge,” the arts and culture show “BETA,” the health show “Zorba Paster On Your Health” and the local “University of the Air.” 
Republicans in control of the U.S. Congress have been considering a proposal to rescind federal money previously allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes federal funds to local stations across the country. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to take $1.1 billion from CPB and the Senate has until mid-July to pass its own version of the provision. 
About four percent of WPR’s budget comes from federal CPB funds. 
But WPR’s financial troubles were looming prior to the Republican cuts, with the station facing a budget deficit in recent years. WPR itself reported that the prospect of layoffs was raised almost a year ago and there is a plan to merge WPR with the more financially stable PBS Wisconsin in the works. 
“We’re saddened to say goodbye to these valued colleagues and shows that have been an important part of our recent history,” Sarah Ashworth, WPR director, said in a letter announcing the changes. “This is a difficult decision and WPR must prioritize its capacity to provide what no other media outlet can: unique Wisconsin content from a decidedly Wisconsin point of view. A focus on creating Wisconsin content for Wisconsin audiences is our obligation to — and our richest opportunity for — public service.”

(Stock photo by SeventyFour/Getty Images)Federal, state, and local officials say 60 children ranging in age from 9-17 have been recovered in what an official called the “the largest in the history of the United States Marshal Service.”
During a Monday morning news conference in Tampa, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was joined by state, local, and federal law enforcement officials to announce the results of the operation that spanned two weeks. 
“Operation Dragon Eye” involved 20 agencies and more than 100 people, recovering 60 missing children in “critical danger.”
“This is what it’s all about. This is why we do the job,” Uthmeier said. 
According to Uthmeier’s office, the eight people arrested face various charges, including human trafficking, child endangerment, drug possession, and drug trafficking.
“Many of these kids have been through painful disastrous situations but, at least today, we’ve rescued them and we now can work towards recovery,” Uthmeier said.
Bill Berger, U.S. Marshal for the Central District of Florida, called the operation “the largest in the history of the United States Marshal Service, if not the history of the United States.”
The bonds range from no bond to $250 million, Berger said. “I’ve never heard of that before,” Berger said. 
The children were reported missing in Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Pasco counties.
Callahan Walsh, director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and co-host of America’s Most Wanted on Fox, encouraged the attorney general to continue prosecuting missing children crimes. 
“This is more than a number. It represents dozens of lives brought out of harm’s way, and a powerful testament to what can be accomplished through communication, collaboration, and data sharing,” Walsh said. 
Katherine Gomez, director of human trafficking intervention at the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice, said more than half of the 60 children rescued have had previous involvement with the juvenile justice system. 
“Every kid recovered by this operation is an opportunity. It’s a it’s a chance, it’s a touch point, it’s a connection for that young person and the larger community,” Gomez said. “And maybe today will be the day that that young person decides to make major changes in their life. Maybe today is not that day, but today at least that day of recovery.”
Natasha Nascimento, founder of Redefining Refuge, a nonprofit serving youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation, said several children recovered were pregnant.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order on Monday that directs the referendum aimed at overturning HB267 to be placed on the 2026 general election ballot, the latest update in months of controversy over lawmakers’ attempts to strip public unions of their ability to collectively bargain. 
Cox’s order comes after an announcement from Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office over the weekend confirming that a coalition of labor groups gathered enough signatures to qualify for a referendum, which is when voters choose to enact or repeal legislation during an election.

HB267 was already on hold after Henderson’s office announced in May that county clerks around the state had processed and certified enough signatures. On Saturday, Henderson signed a letter officially declaring the requirements to qualify for a referendum had been met. 
One of the most controversial bills passed during the 2025 legislative session, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. That means a teachers union would no longer be allowed to negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees.
Lawmakers said the bill would protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. If a teachers union only represents one third of the employees in a school district, it shouldn’t be able to negotiate employment contracts on behalf of everyone, said the bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy.
But the bill outraged the state’s unions, both public and private, arguing it made workplaces less safe and stripped public employees of their right to advocate. That opposition morphed into the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consisted of groups like the Utah Education Association, the Professional Firefighters of Utah and the Utah Fraternal Order of Police. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

After the legislative session ended in March, the coalition began collecting signatures for a referendum. 
Qualifying for a ballot referendum in Utah requires gathering signatures from at least 8% of the active voters in the state, meaning about 141,000 people. That 8% threshold must also be met in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
Those signatures must be gathered in 30 days, making Utah’s requirements some of the most stringent of any state that allows referendums.
On April 16, the coalition announced it had submitted 320,000 signatures to county clerks across the state, which they say is the most signatures ever gathered for a referendum in Utah. By April 28, data showed that the coalition would likely qualify to put a referendum on the ballot. 
According to data from the lieutenant governor’s office, 251,274 signatures have been confirmed as of May 9. The 8% threshold was also met in 23 of 29 Senate districts. 
Per Utah code, if enough signatures are confirmed, the referendum is then put on the ballot for the general election — but since it’s an off year, Cox had the choice to either declare a special election, or direct the referendum to be put on hold until the next general election. 
Cox chose the latter, meaning voters will decide during statewide midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026. 
The Utah Education Association, a statewide teachers union, called the step a major victory for public workers. 
“You stood in the rain, snow and heat. You gave up weekends, evenings and even spring break to gather signatures and educate voters,” said the association’s president, Renée Pinkney. “You showed up for your students, your colleagues and your communities, and you made history.”

Nippon Steel completed its purchase of U.S. Steel last week, placing two Iron Range mines under new ownership with some oversight from the federal government under a national security pact.
The deal includes a “golden share” that gives President Donald Trump and future administrations an ability to block certain actions and some leverage to enforce promises made by the Japanese steelmaker.
In practice, the arrangement is a permanent single share of preferred stock in U.S. Steel that allows the president or a designee to effectively serve on the company’s board.
As part of the pact, a number of potential activities by the company are disallowed without approval of the president, ranging from moving its headquarters to following through on investments.
For the Iron Range, the deal intends to send about $800 million in investments to U.S. Steel mines between 2025 and 2028 as part of a larger promise to spend $11 billion domestically. That total also calls for construction of a new $1 billion mini mill at an undetermined location.
Nippon is set to spend $200 million in 2025 and 2026, and $300 million in 2027 and 2028 at the company’s Minntac and Keetac facilities, subject to approvals and permits, according to SEC filings.
No details have been provided on the scope of those local investments, and a spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber told Iron Range Today recently that particulars were still unknown.
The United Steelworkers (USW) have been the biggest opponent of the merger since it was announced in December 2023, and supported U.S. Steel rival Cleveland-Cliffs to acquire the company.
Union officials were miffed that the company didn’t consult with them before agreeing to the Nippon Steel sale, and have sought written assurances from the new parent company that would protect contracts, jobs and retiree benefits.
Nippon has said it would honor current collective bargaining agreements with USW, which are set to expire next year, but little-to-no language concerning workers and jobs was present in the national security pact publicized Wednesday.
The deal calls for the company to maintain base salaries of current employees until 2030, and is meant to safeguard against plant closures, idles or sales up to June 18, 2035, including at Minntac and Keetac.
But it also carved out an exception for temporary plant idles, which typically include layoffs and a more open-ended timeline than the term implies.
That’s the current case at two Cliffs facilities on the Iron Range. The company announced temporary idles in March, impacting 630 miners at Hibbing Taconite and Minorca Mine.
Company officials anticipated a six-month down period, but union leaders have expressed concern over the winterizing process at Minorca — calling it instead an “indefinite idle” period, and whether the full workforce at HibTac will ever return.
USW President Dave McCall said Wednesday that union would work to hold Nippon responsible to its promises.
“Our current agreement expires in September 2026,” he said, “and rest assured, if our job security, pensions, retiree health care or other hard-earned benefits are threatened, we are ready to respond with the full strength and solidarity of our membership.”
More broadly, the Keetac and Minntac facilities would stand to benefit from a cash infusion.
Keetac recently finalized upgrades to produce of DR-grade pellets to feed electric-arc furnaces, and was reportedly a facility of interest for Nippon from the start. It also faces a large unknown with its water permits and state sulfate standards, which could present a significant cost hurdle.
Minntac also has permit renewals on the horizon, as well as general maintenance at the largest taconite mine in the United States.
Nippon will also have to navigate a 25% ownership stake in Minntac by Cliffs, stemming from a pandemic-era decision by U.S. Steel to sell part of the mine to Stelco in 2020. Terms of the deal appear to allow the company a clean out in 2027, but at a cost of $120 million. Stelco was purchased by Cliffs last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iron-ore-us-steel-1024x693.webp,,,2025-06-23 14:10:45.545230

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a new law Friday to make a series of changes to the Prisoner Review Board after it released a man who would go on to commit murder, leading to intense scrutiny in Springfield.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 19, which contains changes designed to include victims’ participation in Prisoner Review Board decisions and ensure more board members have relevant law enforcement or judicial experience.

The law gives victims the right to file impact statements ahead of hearings, provides them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allows them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

It also creates the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services within the PRB, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights. The measure also mandates the board provide victims with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline.

“The bulk of this bill is focused on … making sure that victims, survivors, are more engaged in the process at PRB because unfortunately, too often, we’ve heard from victims and family members that they simply haven’t been given a voice in this process,” bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said when the bill passed the House last month.

The bill was approved by the Senate in April on a 33-22 vote, with some Democrats opposing it. The House voted 74-37 along party lines to send the bill to Pritzker’s desk in May. Republicans, who had for months been calling for broader reforms, criticized the bill.

Pritzker’s signature comes just two weeks after a man released by the PRB was found guilty of murdering 11-year-old Jayden Perkins at his Chicago home in March 2024.

Crosetti Brand was released from prison in 2023 after serving a sentence for a domestic violence conviction. After his release, Brand began threatening a former partner, Laterria Smith, and showed up to her home in February 2024, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Brand was sent back to prison for violating the conditions of his release, and Smith filed for an order of protection. But a Cook County judge denied the order because Brand was behind bars.

On March 12, 2024, the PRB voted to release Brand citing a lack of evidence to keep him behind bars, the Sun-Times reported. The next day, Brand confronted Smith at her home and stabbed her and her son, Perkins, multiple times. Smith survived but Perkins did not. Brand was found guilty of first-degree murder and 16 other counts earlier this month.

Two board members, including the chair, resigned after Perkins’ death. Smith sued the board for negligence in March.

The case put even more scrutiny on the board, which was already in the spotlight over other controversial decisions to release people from prison.

In May 2024, the Senate unanimously passed a bill that would have made a series of reforms to the board, including requiring that certain meetings be livestreamed and board members receive additional training. The bill appeared ready to pass the House with 76 members signing on as cosponsors. But the bill was never called for a vote in the final hours of session after Pritzker had concerns about the feasibility of the livestreaming requirements and lack of funding for the board.

Instead, lawmakers moved forward with the legislation signed by Pritzker on Friday, which Republicans opposed saying it doesn’t go far enough to meaningfully reform the board.

“After the Governor ignored our consistent and clear warnings, a horrible murder was triggered by a terrible decision by the Prisoner Review Board,” Sens. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville, and Steve McClure, R-Springfield, said in a statement. “Now, instead of listening to a bipartisan coalition at the capitol, he and his far-left allies pushed through a bill that makes it more difficult for the PRB to keep violent criminals off the streets.”

The new law also attempts to make the board more professional, Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, the Senate sponsor of the bill, said in April. It gives board members eight-year terms instead of six so they can be more focused on their decisions rather than their reappointment, he said. It also changes qualifications for board members, requiring seven out of the 15 board members have at least five years of experience as a law enforcement officer, parole officer, prosecutor, criminal defense attorney or judge.

Republicans opposed creating longer terms for board members, saying it reduces Senate oversight of the board and fails to hold board members accountable for decisions. The Senate is responsible for confirming the governor’s appointments to the board.

HUNTSVILLE — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.

Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.

‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.

Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”

Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

Michigan’s U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) announced Monday that she plans to introduce the “Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act” within the next week. Stevens’ bill would make it illegal for Trump, or any other president in the future, to deploy active duty military forces to a state or a territory without a request from that state’s governor or that territory’s executive leadership.
Trump deployed U.S. Marines to the streets of Los Angeles this month in response to community uprisings and protests against federal ICE raids targeting immigrants in California. He also moved to control the California National Guard, which was at first blocked by a federal district court, but was allowed later by a federal appellate court panel.

Stevens said the Trump administration’s actions would only increase tensions between law enforcement and protesters.
“President Trump has shown a disturbing pattern of disregard for the Constitution and due process. This month, he made it harder for local law enforcement to do their jobs in California by unlawfully deploying our military on U.S. soil – further escalating tension and violence,” Stevens said in a statement. “We must stand up to Donald Trump’s chaos and destruction, which is why I am introducing this legislation to limit his powers and make sure he cannot deploy troops on U.S. soil for his political gain. We are a nation of laws and it’s about time the president begins to follow them.”
A news release noted that Stevens’ bill would add the language prohibiting unauthorized military deployments to rein in citizen uprisings to the Insurrection Act of 1807 and would only apply to peaceful protests and demonstrations.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A government watchdog says it’s unclear when — or even whether — we’ll know going forward how the end of national abortion protections impact Americans’ health outcomes, livelihoods and financial futures as the federal government turns away from abortion data collection indefinitely.
A report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office and first shared exclusively with The 19th analyzed the existing data on the economic impact of abortion bans and found that government tracking has been very limited — and could become more so due to changes made by the Trump administration.
The last federal data on the impact of abortion bans ends in 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned. That data is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been collecting data on the number of abortions and the demographics of those who obtain them in its Abortion Surveillance report for almost six decades. Since publishing the 2022 data in November (data is typically released on a two-year delay), it’s unclear whether the agency plans to continue the research. Though the CDC’s survey is voluntary and limited in scope — some states, including California, for example, don’t provide information — the report was one of the most reliable sources of government abortion data.
Without it, there is no detailed federal data on what has happened since Roe was overturned. Tuesday marks three years since the landmark Supreme Court case was reversed in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision.
“According to Department of Health and Human Services officials we spoke to in May 2025, the agency, which includes CDC, is undergoing a realignment,” the nonpartisan GAO, which provides independent research for Congress and executive agencies, wrote in its report. “Officials were uncertain whether the resulting changes at the agency would affect future data collection efforts, including data on abortions.”
For its analysis, GAO contacted seven federal agencies to ask what efforts they were undertaking to assess the economic effects of state abortion restrictions. Only the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary said it planned to consider the economic impact of abortion restrictions in some of its upcoming work. The agency uses CDC data to make predictions about birth rates and whether any impact from abortion bans could affect the broader economy and the size of the labor force.
But the agency told GAO it will require three years of abortion data since Roe v. Wade was overturned to be able to come to any conclusion and, even then, the data over that period is so limited it may be too insufficient to be reliable.
All of it hinges on whether the CDC continues to collect state abortion data at all. The CDC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Already, the Trump administration has moved to eliminate research on abortion. In January, Trump issued an executive order blocking data collection measuring the effect of access to reproductive care, including abortion care. The administration scrubbed several references to abortion on the Department of Health and Human Services’ website.
That data could potentially illuminate for lawmakers the myriad effects abortion restrictions can have. Beyond the health consequences, lack of abortion access can destabilize people economically, affecting everything from where they choose to live to whether they can stay employed.
“Not only does the new report show impacts of these harmful bans in stark terms, it also raises red flags about the government’s ability to collect important economic data due to the Trump Administration’s attacks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, in a statement to The 19th. The investigation into the data was requested by Scott and Sen. Richard Blumental, a New York Democrat.
For its report released Monday, GAO had to instead turn to 55 rigorously researched studies conducted over the past seven years, including from the Guttmacher Institute and research published in peer-reviewed medical journals such as JAMA and the American Journal of Public Health. GAO also spoke with four academic researchers and three national organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Blumental called the report “irrefutable” evidence of the impact the Dobbs ruling has on the financial stability of women.
“There’s a proven connection between slashed reproductive freedoms and devastating financial distress. Unsafe and unintended pregnancies have huge costs — in lives and dollars — impacting all of us,” Blumental said in a statement to The 19th. “This fact-based document is a searing indictment of Dobbs on its third anniversary.”
According to the research, getting an abortion has become more expensive since some states banned the procedure, requiring patients to often take time off work to travel to a state with abortion access, plus the cost of that travel, the care itself and any child care expenses. It amounts to a “significant expense for low-income families,” GAO found.
One 2021 study out of Tennessee showed that even the introduction of a mandatory, 48-hour waiting period in 2015 that required two visits to get an abortion caused the average cost to rise by several hundred dollars.
Abortion access also impacts other decisions people make around where to live and whether they get an education. One 2023 study that GAO highlighted found that working women with at least a bachelor’s degree were more than 7 percent more likely to move to a state without restrictions than one with it. Another post-Roe study found that Black women living in states with abortion restrictions as teenagers were less likely than Black women in other states to enter college and complete it.
People who are unable to get an abortion then face worse financial outcomes in the months and years that follow. GAO cites findings from the Turnaway Study, a massive abortion research project that followed 1,000 women over 10 years studying the ways that being denied an abortion reshaped their lives.
Historically, about half of people who seek abortions live in poverty, and economic stability is one of the top reasons they seek an abortion in the first place. Many cite concerns around caring for the children they already have.
The United States’ lacks a strong social safety net for parents — those on food assistance programs can’t use the funds they receive to buy diapers, for instance; mothers on the federal assistance program for low-income women and children are deeply restricted in what formula they can buy with government assistance; and child care across the country is now costlier than in-state tuition in 41 states. For a single parent, child care costs swallow a third of their income on average (and in some states as much as half).
The Turnaway Study found that women who were denied care fell deeper into poverty and took four years to catch up to the employment levels of the women in the study who did receive an abortion. GAO’s analysis of the existing data also found that women who were denied care were less likely to be working full-time six months after the denial.
Diana Greene Foster, the author of the Turnaway Study and a MacArthur “genius grant” recipient, was hoping to continue her work by following people who sought abortions after the overturn of Roe.
But Foster was only six months into a five-year federal grant to fund the study when federal funding was terminated in March.
In a letter from the National Institutes of Health that Foster shared with The 19th at the time, she was told her research no longer aligned with agency priorities: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OLIVEAUPHOTO-2048x1662-1-1024x831.jpg,,,2025-06-23 13:11:44.822008

The state Department of Health maintains a map of cooling centers open to the public — although there are caveats to keep in mind before you head to one. 
The National Weather Service has issued an extreme heat warning for parts of Franklin, Grand Isle, Chittenden and Addison counties through Tuesday at 8 p.m., and a heat advisory for the rest of the state. Burlington is forecast to hit 97 degrees Monday and 96 degrees Tuesday, with cooler temperatures expected for the rest of the week.
The health department lists more than 400 potential places for Vermonters to go inside for air conditioning or access water to help stay cool. Some locations are only occasional cooling facilities, so the department recommends calling ahead to check if they’re open to the public. Others might only be open during the daytime or only on certain days of the week. You can also call 211 to help find an open cooling location near you.

Other locations are recreation sites with bodies of water but charge an entry fee, like a pool or a state park. Housing advocates have said in previous years that it can be difficult for unhoused Vermonters to access these locations. 
Older adults, young children and people with chronic health conditions are more at risk of heat-related illnesses, according to the health department. It recommends Vermonters stay hydrated, avoid exertion and wear light, loose-fitting clothing if they go outside. 
If your home is not air conditioned, keeping the shades drawn, taking cool showers and using a fan can be helpful to keep the temperature down inside, the department said. It has more information on avoiding heat-related injuries on its website.

The bill’s lead sponsors include U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both Oregon Democrats, and U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both Idaho Republicans.
“This is a significant, encouraging and urgently needed step for Oregonians living and working in counties that have depended for decades on these federal investments for local schools, roads, law enforcement and more,” Wyden said in a press release. Wyden co-authored the initial bipartisan legislation in 2000.
The sponsors introduced the legislation in 2024, where it unanimously passed the Senate but did not receive a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives before the end of the congressional session.
This year, bill sponsors are urging the U.S. House to reauthorize the program. Without its passage in the House, rural counties in Oregon, Idaho and across the country will fall short of funds that support local services.
“Idaho counties rely on (Secure Rural Schools) funding for schools, road maintenance, and other essential services,” Risch said in the release. “Until we can bring historic timber revenue back to these areas, this program must be reauthorized. The federal government made a promise to rural communities, and I’m proud to see the Senate follow through.”

And when one digs deeper into the data Nordstrom analyzed, it’s clear that his assessment is on the mark. The numbers reveal that, in the current school year, only a tiny percentage of vouchers went to students who attended public school in the previous year – a fact that makes clear the voucher program disproportionately benefits wealthy families who had already enrolled their children in private schools. And recently, Newsline’s Rob Schofield sat down with Nordstrom to learn more about this finding and the destructive impact vouchers are having on public education.

A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 17, 2025.
Tegtmeyer has faced disciplinary charges from the board on at least three prior occasions. In 2005, Tegtmeyer, then known as Diane Teske, was charged by the board with falsifying records related to and committing some sort of an act that might have adversely affected a patient’s welfare.

The board alleged Tegtmeyer had been working at a long-term care facility from December 2004 until she was fired in October 2005 for allegedly charting that she had given medication to more than one resident but instead “put the medication in the garbage.” The board ordered Tegtmeyer to complete 30 hours of training on ethics.
In 2007, the board charged Tegtmeyer with practicing nursing without an active license and being convicted of crime related to the practice of nursing. The board alleged Tegtmeyer was fired by her employer, unnamed by the board, for taking the credit card of an associate and using it to make purchases at Walmart. She later pled guilty to a charge of credit card forgery, according to board records. The board fined Tegtmeyer $50 and ordered her to complete another 30 hours of training in ethics.
In 2012, Tegtmeyer was convicted of the criminal charge of tampering with records and later began working at Heritage Care Center in Iowa Falls.
In 2015, the Board of Nursing alleged Tegtmeyer failed to report the tampering-with-records conviction to the board and charged Tegtmeyer with knowingly making misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession, and knowingly made misleading or untrue representations related to her credentials or licensure status.
The board also alleged she falsified records related to her submission of a family member’s urine sample, which she sent to a lab for testing. In resolving the case, the board fined Tegtmeyer $500 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training on ethics.
Other nursing board actions
Other Iowa nurses facing sanctions from the board include:
— Ann Schwartz of Marion, a registered nurse who worked at an unspecified behavioral health hospital in the Des Moines area and allegedly knowingly made misleading or untrue representations in the practice of the profession, knowingly made misleading or untrue representations that may have involved falsified records, and failed to assess or report the status of a patient.

— Shana Moss of Danbury, a registered nurse who was charged by the board with misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient or agency. The board alleged that Moss was working at an unspecified nursing facility in September 2024 when she was suspected of stealing Ozempic from a resident. Cameras at the facility allegedly showed that about 9:25 p.m., on Sept. 8, 2024, Moss walked into the home’s medicine room and took the Ozempic out of the box, placed it in her pocket and kept it. The medication was not scheduled to be given to the patient at that time, the board alleged. To resolve the case, the board issued Moss a warning and ordered her to complete 30 hours of training in ethics.
— Amanda Hake of Davenport, an Iowa-licensed nurse who in 2022 pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of controlled substances — oxycodone and clonazepam — without a prescription. In response to that, in April 2024 the board suspended Hake’s license pending a substance abuse evaluation and enrollment in a chemical screening program.
In August 2024, she was pulled over by police and cited for an open container of alcohol in her car. In October 2024, she was charged with theft for allegedly operating a vehicle that had been reported as stolen. Around that time, the board alleges, she failed to make daily contact with the chemical screening program as required and also failed to submit to testing on multiple occasions.
In January 2025, the board issued an emergency order suspending Hake’s license. The board alleges that during a subsequent board hearing on the matter, Hake initially claimed she had not worked as a nurse in the fall of 2024 but later admitted she had done so, working up to four 12-hour shifts at an unspecified medical facility.
On April 25, 2025, the board revoked Hake’s license.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)As the summer heat moves in, thermostats are turning down. Cooling our homes is a natural reaction that we don’t tend to think much about –– until the electric bill shows up.
June not only kicked off summer, but with it came new electric rates for all utility customers as prices jumped on the heels of the PJM capacity auction price increase. This prompted the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to issue a press release advising energy users of tips to shop for their electricity.
Why? Because that’s where customers can find savings.
Aside from adjusting your thermostat to conserve electricity, the only control Pennsylvania consumers have over their electric bill is their electric supply –– the product that actually powers their home. What most people don’t realize is they have options to shop for different suppliers, just like they shop for other products and services. And the savings can be significant. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the early 1990s, when I was commissioner with the PUC, Pennsylvania was dealing with rolling blackouts and high electric rates. The Commission knew action had to be taken to improve the energy market for consumers. 
In 1996, after working with the legislature, the Electricity Generation Competition and Customer Choice Act was signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge. This solution broke up the utility monopolies in the state and welcomed competition to generate and supply electricity. This freed customers to choose the products they wanted and for the prices that worked best with their budget. It also meant all suppliers had to compete for business –– including utility companies. 
After nearly 30 years of energy competition, it was time to analyze electricity prices to see if competition is still working. What I found is pretty eye-opening and should serve as a positive reminder that Pennsylvania leaders took –– and have preserved –– the best course of action to protect energy customers. 
Here’s what I uncovered.
In three utility service territories, customers could have been paying less for their electricity supply in 2024 than what they paid in 1996, if they shopped for the lowest fixed-rate offer in those areas. This means the customers in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas could have, respectively, paid $9 and $14 less a month in 2024 compared to what they paid in 1996. 
That’s without even adjusting for inflation.
When inflation is factored in, statewide, customers who shopped for their electricity in 2024 were paying, on average, 26 percent to 67 percent less than they would have in 1996 for supply charges. In the Duquesne Light territory, that’s a $53 difference –– a $56 difference in the PECO territory. 
Moreover, actual utility supply rates in 2024, paid by customers who do not shop, are less than what the 1996 inflation-adjusted rates are.

All Pennsylvania electricity customers are benefiting from energy competition, whether they shop or not. And the benefits expand beyond price. 
Customers today have access to products and plans that have been driven by competition working to deliver new innovations in order to earn the business of customers. More importantly, Pennsylvania hasn’t seen a rolling blackout due to inadequate generation or supply since 1994 –– two years before the competition legislation was signed into law.
As consumers, we shop around for just about everything. But all too often, we default to an electric service without knowing there are options. The PUC is right in promoting tips and information for customers to find savings by shopping on PAPowerswitch. 
With energy choice the power is in the hands of consumers. 
Use it.

Mallory McMorrow pushed back hard on claims by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that the U.S. is facing a “northern border crisis,” saying the Trump administration should be looking harder at homegrown extremism with the recent killing of a Minnesota lawmaker. 
“I have not talked to a single person in this state who thinks we have an issue with Canada,” McMorrow told Michigan Advance in Ferndale, where she kicked off her McMorrow on Tap Brewery Tour on Friday night.
McMorrow, a Royal Oak Democrat vying to win the nomination of her party in August 2026 for U.S. Senate, took the weekend to visit several breweries across the state.

While data from the federal government indicates that illegal crossings at the US-Canada border make up less than 1% of the almost 3 million encounters reported nationwide, Noem still claimed there was a “northern border crisis” during an event Friday in Detroit. 
McMorrow said that assertion would likely only result in scaring immigrant and border communities, while at the same time essentially ignoring the rising threat of domestic extremism, referencing the recent assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Horton, who was shot dead in her home, along with her husband, by a gunman who authorities have said appears to have been politically motivated. 
“It’s been five days and it’s barely made the news,” McMorrow said. “There’s this growing sense that government is something happening at people, not with them. That disconnect is fueling the extremism we’re seeing.”
Despite that, McMorrow said she and her team have ramped up in-person events to try and restore public trust and lower the political temperature.
“If we can just meet people, grab a beer, and get to know each other, they’ll see I’m not some troll they saw in a viral video—I’m a mom. I live in your neighborhood,” McMorrow told the Advance just prior to addressing supporters at The Ferndale Project brewery.
McMorrow was the first Democrat to announce her intention to run for U.S. Senate after Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) said he would not seek reelection. 
She has since been joined by former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) is, so far, the lone GOP candidate.
McMorrow said that while the atmosphere of fear and misinformation has contributed to widespread frustration over that political divide, that’s not what she primarily hears about on the campaign trail.
“There are way too many people across the state who say, ‘I have done everything right and I’m still getting screwed. I still can’t afford to buy a house. I can’t afford to save for retirement. I would love to start a family, but I can’t afford it.’ And even for people who may have voted for Trump, they’re saying loudly now, this has done nothing to lower my costs,” McMorrow said. 
McMorrow also expressed frustration with House Republicans over the stalled state budget process. 
With a July 1 deadline looming to pass a new state budget, she accused House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) of making sweeping promises—including eliminating the state income tax and increasing per-pupil school funding to $12,000 —without proposing a viable budget.
“He’s painted himself into a corner,” McMorrow said. “You can promise the world, but at the end of the day, we have to pass a budget. People are counting on us.”
She added that Republican committee chairs have been hesitant to even begin negotiations with their Democratic counterparts. “That should’ve been happening months ago,” she said.
Still, McMorrow was cautiously optimistic that mounting pressure could push forward bipartisan cooperation. 
“It feels like there is some softening,” she said. “At the end of the day, we have a job to do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05040-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 12:16:28.481099

(Photo by Joe Cook/Georgia Rivers)An Alabama company that was close to receiving the final go-ahead from the state of Georgia to mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has decided to instead sell the land to a nonprofit focused on conserving at-risk sites.
Twin Pines Minerals, which first proposed the controversial mining project in 2019, is in the process of selling about 8,000 acres near the refuge to The Conservation Fund. Twin Pines’ president Steve Ingle confirmed the sale through his public relations firm but declined further comment Friday.
The nearly $60 million land deal will halt a mining project that became the poster child of the first Trump administration’s move to scale back federal protections for the nation’s waterways. That left the decision on whether to approve the project in the hands of state regulators, who issued draft permits early last year that were close to being finalized.
The sale presents a second time a mining proposal near the swamp was thwarted due to public outcry. A DuPont proposal in the 1990s near the refuge faced intense pressure, and the company eventually dropped the project and sold the land to The Conservation Fund.
Stacy Funderburke, who serves as vice president of The Conservation Fund’s central Southeast region, said efforts to buy the land around Trail Ridge — the mineral-rich target of mining companies that is seen as an important barrier for the swamp — had been in the works for roughly three years. The deal includes the mineral rights for the site.
“This is the most important conservation project that we’ve ever worked on because of how imminent the threat was, not only to this site, but to the entire Okefenokee Swamp,” Funderburke said.
The sale is set to be completed by the end of July, though The Conservation Fund hopes to continue raising money from private donors and foundations. Currently, there are between 10 and 15 major donors who are funding the project, and more expected to contribute down the road, Funderburke said.
Funderburke also credits environmental activists across Georgia for their work drawing awareness to the swamp, which he said was a key factor in acquiring the philanthropic backing needed to purchase the land.
“The public response since this threat started six years ago — all the work that’s been done, and all the voices of people across Georgia that have come out and said that it’s not worth the risk to a place like the Okefenokee to have mining immediately next door — that is why I think funders and others have been willing to step up to the table,” he said. “It’s really hearing the loud voice of everyone who wants to see this protected.”
The refuge has also been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which would cement its status as an international tourist destination on par with the Grand Canyon and Galápagos Islands. It spans 402,000 acres in southeastern Georgia and North Florida.
 ‘Settled in a good way’

The mining proposal sparked a public outcry and was at the center of a yearslong debate at the state Capitol, where lawmakers from both parties pushed for protections for Trail Ridge.
Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican who has become known as one of the swamp’s chief defenders at the statehouse, said Friday that she was delighted by the news.
“Protecting the swamp was what it was all about, and I just feel so much better knowing that it’s going to be secure,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the announced land deal is an ideal compromise.
“It was settled in a good way,” she said. “I think everybody in it can be pretty calm about it at this point. [The Okefenokee Swamp is] being protected, they’re being compensated for it, and we can move forward now.”
U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had opposed the project from Washington.
“This step toward protecting the Okefenokee Swamp is great news for all Georgians and our beloved natural treasure,” he said in a statement. “For years, I’ve been sounding the alarm that strip mining near the Okefenokee Swamp poses irreversible damage to an irreplaceable natural resource.”
 ‘A model for protecting Trail Ridge’

From the start, the mining project was met with concerns about the potential impact on the swamp’s water levels and an ecosystem that is home to thousands of species of animals and plants.
A broad coalition that included environmental groups, faith leaders, and others relentlessly warned of the project’s potential harm to the largest blackwater swamp in North America.
Those groups helped galvanize an army of Okefenokee Swamp fans who flooded state regulators any time public input was sought along the way.
“This is an incredibly special outcome and there is no place more deserving than the Okefenokee,” said Megan Huynh, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Georgians sent a clear message to Twin Pines Minerals that mining next to the Okefenokee is an unacceptable risk.
“This wouldn’t have been possible without a powerful coalition, and regular Georgians who were willing to stand up and defend a place as beloved as the Okefenokee,” Huynh said.
Rena Ann Peck, executive director of Georgia Rivers, said the deal will help pave the way to conserve more of Trail Ridge. There are still more than 25,000 acres left vulnerable to mining, Peck said.
“I think this is a model for protecting Trail Ridge, the outright land conservation through acquisition and conservation easements,” Peck said. “Retiring the mining rights is paramount to saving it in perpetuity.”
As an advocate, Peck was a vocal critic of the Twin Pines’ proposal. But she said her favorite part of the job is bringing potential land conservation buyers to the Okefenokee in hopes of helping them form a connection with the swamp.
“I show them the vastness,” she said. “I like to say that you can paddle these 120 miles of canoe trails and still only see 2% of the swamp.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)When University of Iowa researcher and assistant professor Boeun Kim worked as a nurse, some of the older adults she treated would have problems that no health care professional can solve — low income, a small or nonexistent support network and less access to healthy food.
Pair any of these issues with growing older and many patients were experiencing cognitive decline in some way, Kim said. A study from the researcher and colleagues at John Hopkins and Columbia universities found that people over the age of 65 living in urban areas lacking healthy food options saw a faster decline in cognitive abilities than their peers.
Kim said she hopes to expand her study to different living situations and geographical areas, and hopes the information will eventually lead to changes in policy and practice in places where healthy food is harder to find.
“I really want to support them, but I feel like … I could not provide the optimal care for them because of issues with communication and other symptoms, but at the same time I also felt frustrated, because there is no cure for dementia for now,” Kim said. “So I felt like I should intervene at the prevention level, like at the community (level,) before they come into the hospital.”

It was during her time as a nurse when Kim first became interested in cognitive functions, she said, as people would come in with a cognitive impairment and have difficulties communicating with staff, made worse by additional symptoms like anxiety and delirium.
Kim said she was unable to help patients with the factors leading to their decline, namely poverty and lack of resources where they lived. While specific medical needs could be addressed, Kim said she couldn’t solve their food insecurity or the chronic stress that can develop as a result.
Having an unhealthy diet can lead to greater risks of developing diabetes and other conditions that can contribute to cognitive decline, Kim said, including obesity and hypertension.
Using datasets from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Health and Aging Trends Study, the research team narrowed their search to people 65 or older, living in urban areas also designated as “unhealthy food environments.” These locations were described by Kim as areas without a grocery store or supermarket that also have a lower-income population.
“We found that individuals living in both high poverty level and then low food (options) in the area experience faster declines in cognitive function over time, among all those who live in the urban communities,” Kim said.
People with disabilities, who have a low income and who are marginalized are more likely to be living in these areas, Kim said, and are experiencing other structural barriers and hardships in addition to food insecurity. This problem worsens health disparities for these populations, she added, and she wants to make these environments more equitable.
In the future, Kim said she wants to look at the same age group but in rural areas, to see how food deserts in Iowa and their impact on older adults compares to what she found in urban areas across the U.S. She also wants to introduce other variables, like transportation capabilities and price of food, to further study the issue.
While the study itself does not identify solutions that would combat this problem best, Kim said the findings will hopefully prompt conversation among community leaders and lawmakers about how to solve urban healthy food insecurity. There won’t be any catch-all fix, she said, but expanding community food assistance and delivery programs and incentivizing people with healthy food businesses like grocery stores to settle in the area could be a good start.
Teaching people about better behaviors, like eating healthy and exercising, can only go so far when there are structural barriers to improving a lifestyle, she said.
“I really feel like we should make the environment better first, then emphasize that you should improve your behaviors,” Kim said.

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation praised U.S. military forces following the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, but disagreed as to whether President Donald Trump threatened to draw the United States in a lengthy conflict or exercised “peace through strength.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of the 3rd District in the Kansas City area said she awaited intelligence reports on whether Saturday’s attacks by the United States effectively addressed dangers posed by three Iranian nuclear facilities.
“But, let me be clear, President Trump’s unilateral decision to launch military action against Iran without constitutionally mandated congressional approval puts American troops and global stability at risk and threatens another endless war,” Davids said.
Other Democrats in Congress echoed Davids’ concern and complained the Trump administration should have notified top Democratic congressional lawmakers ahead of the bombing.
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican serving the 1st District, said he supported Trump’s military strategy of promoting “American peace through strength.” He said he was praying for safety of U.S. civilians and troops in the Middle East.
The mission authorized by Trump thrust the United States into military conflict between Israel and Iran that began in early June.
U.S. pilots flying B-2 stealth aircraft stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri successfully executed the precision bombing of Iranian facilities tied to nuclear programs, said U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, the 2nd District Republican.
“Years ago, President Reagan’s resolve freed American hostages from the Iranian regime. I am hopeful … President Trump’s resolve has freed America from that same regime’s ongoing threat of nuclear terrorism,” Schmidt said.
Iran should be viewed as an adversary of the United States and shouldn’t be allowed to control nuclear weapons, said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican. He said U.S. military forces ought to be “vigilant in protecting against any Iranian threats to Americans around the globe.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said “we stand tall with President Trump who is protecting the world from a nuclear-capable Iran.”
Marshall previously said he was certain Trump wouldn’t draw the United States into “another endless war.” The senator also said he would welcome “regime change” in the Iranian government.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, the 4th District congressman from the Wichita area, said Trump was committed to preventing Iran from emerging as a nuclear power.

At least 13 homes have been destroyed by the 5,660-acre fire and roughly 450 residents of Pine Valley, a small community north of St. George, remain under an evacuation order as of Monday morning. The fire is 0% contained and over the weekend the evacuation order was expanded to include the nearby Pinto and Grass Valley communities. 
“Sadly, we have two major fires burning right now,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Sunday, speaking from a smoky Pine Valley alongside firefighters. “These are just the first of likely many that are going to happen … there’s no rain in the forecast for the next two weeks, that means it’s going to be dicey everywhere.” 
The France Canyon Fire is the largest burning in Utah as of Monday, located in a remote area outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. The fire is roughly 15,700 acres and is 10% contained.

The Forsythe Fire was discovered on June 15 and was likely caused by lightning, according to Cox. In just 24 hours last week, during record-breaking heat, high winds and unusually dry conditions, the fire ballooned to over 1,000 acres and was spotted just a quarter-mile from Pine Valley, prompting the evacuation of residents and campers. 
By Friday evening, 12 structures were reported lost, including homes, and on Saturday the evacuation order was expanded. As of Sunday evening, the Great Basin Complex Incident Management Team said 14 structures were lost in the fire, most of them homes. 
Officials in the area say most of those structures were second homes, some belonging to volunteer firefighters who are working the blaze. No one has been displaced by the fire, and many Pine Valley residents have their primary residence in St. George. 
“It’s been a really rough few days,” said Cox. “This is a tragedy, obviously … but we can replace property but we can’t replace people. And the most important statistic today is that nobody has been injured or killed in this fire.” 
The Forsythe Fire is one of at least 349 fires reported around Utah so far this year, according to Utah Fire Info. Most of them — 257 — were human caused. At least 47 were natural, and the cause of the remaining 45 is unknown. 
Those fires have burned an estimated 27,313 acres throughout the state. And as Utahns gear up to celebrate the Fourth of July, Cox urged residents to be vigilant and not take unnecessary risks. 
“This is one of those years,” he said. “Hold off on your personal fireworks.”

Then the program blew up.,"Anita Lee, Sun Herald and Taylor Vance",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/23/private-business-ticketed-uninsured-mississippi-vehicle-owners-then-the-program-blew-up/,"The uninsured motorist program that Securix brought to Mississippi proved contentious from the start. In Ocean Springs, some vehicle owners were angry when they learned artificial intelligence had been used to ticket them for driving without insurance.","Politically connected members of a Mississippi company have fallen out with their Georgia partner in what promised to be a profitable business to snare uninsured motorists with cameras and artificial intelligence. 
A company that the three Mississippians formed, QJR LLC, is suing its partner in the uninsured motorist ticketing venture, Georgia-based Securix LLC. QJR represents the first initials of its members: Quinton Dickerson, Josh Gregory and Robert Wilkinson.
Dickerson and Gregory are Republican political operatives in Jackson who have run numerous state and local campaigns and advise many of the state’s top elected officials. Wilkinson, a Coast attorney, has represented local governments and government agencies.
But Judge Neil Harris has sealed the case, leaving the public in the dark about the specifics. Mississippi Today has filed a motion in the case, arguing that the file should be opened to the public.
An attorney representing the three Mississippians said in a document submitted in federal court, where the case was temporarily moved, “The case involves highly sensitive issues implicating local officials, reputational harm, and ongoing injunctive relief.”
The uninsured motorist program that Securix brought to Mississippi proved contentious from the start. In Ocean Springs, some vehicle owners were angry when they learned artificial intelligence had been used to ticket them for driving without insurance.
The Securix program has resulted in several lawsuits, including one in federal court that accuses Securix of deceiving vehicle owners by essentially posing as a law enforcement agency through its mailed citations in Ocean Springs. By April 2023, the city had canceled its contract with Securix LLC.
And there is the secret Chancery Court file. A January 2025 transcript in federal court hints that politics are involved in the chancery case and also describes what that lawsuit is about.
The transcript says the Mississippians, operating as QJR LLC, are suing Securix in Chancery Court for defamation.
“They (QJR) want to stop the defamation from ruining political careers,” an attorney for Securix said. “That’s their argument.”
The chancery lawsuit, the federal transcript says, also seeks to dissolve Securix Mississippi LLC,  a 50-50 partnership QJR and Securix formed to spread the program to other cities.
Securix attempted to move the Chancery Court case to federal court, but a federal judge ruled in January that he didn’t have jurisdiction and returned it to Chancery Court. 
The federal transcript says Securix Mississippi pulled in $1.3 million in a year through uninsured motorist citations but, at the time of the hearing, had less than $75,000 in assets. The judge also noted that “revenue has fallen off a cliff since August of 2024 for Securix Mississippi LLC.”
August 2024 also happens to be when the Department of Public Safety pulled the plug on the program, DPS records show.
DPS Commissioner Sean Tindell, whose agency oversees uninsured motorist enforcement, had reservations from the start about a private company ticketing motorists. Complaints about how the program was being operated, he said, prompted him to cut off Securix’s access to the data it needed to determine whether a vehicle was insured.
While QJR was successful in getting the chancery case sealed, the company had no such luck when it tried to have the federal transcript closed from public view.
A federal magistrate judge ruled on QJR’s motion to seal the transcript, citing federal court cases that said: “The public’s right of access to judicial proceedings is fundamental,” and, “Judicial records belong to the American people; they are public, not private, documents.”
Uninsured motorist program launches in MS
Securix LLC was incorporated in Delaware in 2018 and signed its first Mississippi contract in May 2021 with Shea Dobson, then the mayor of Ocean Springs, after approval by the Board of Aldermen.
Securix, based in Georgia, uses automatic license plate readers, usually mounted on traffic signals, to capture images of license plates. With the help of artificial intelligence, Securix can extract license plate numbers from the images. 
Jonathan Miller, an owner of Securix LLC, initially came to Mississippi and talked to Ocean Springs Police Chief Mark Dunston about the program, said Dunston, who has since retired. Dunston presented the program to the Board of Aldermen, he said, and was later paid by Securix to present the program in other cities during off hours and after his retirement.
It is unclear when Miller met Josh Gregory and Quinton Dickerson, who did not want to comment for the story because the Chancery Court case is sealed. Miller, the chairman of Securix LLC, is also a named defendant in QJR’s lawsuit. He also declined to comment about matters involving the litigation. 
Gregory and Dickerson both worked on former Gov. Haley Barbour’s 2003 political campaign, then formed Ridgeland-based Frontier Strategies. Gregory was a top political adviser to former Gov. Phil Bryant. 
Billed as a full-service advertising agency, Frontier landed a lucrative state contract shortly after Barbour took office in 2004, within six months of the company’s formation. The company has gone on to contract with other state agencies and work on state and local political campaigns.
The third member of QJR, Robert Wilkinson, was serving as city attorney for Ocean Springs when Dobson signed its Securix contract. Wilkinson said he met Miller at that time but they did not have a business relationship until six to 10 months after Ocean Springs signed on with Miller’s company.
Wilkinson said he was impressed with the Securix program because it added cameras in the city that could also alert law enforcement officers to crimes, such as kidnappings or wanted suspects on the loose.
“That’s why everyone was fired up,” he said.
Another reason some welcomed the program is because Mississippi has a high rate of uninsured drivers, according to the nonprofit Insurance Research Council. In 2023, the latest year for which statistics were available, the institute reported that Mississippi had the highest rate of uninsured drivers in the nation at 28.2%.
“Unisured motorists in Mississippi is a big problem and I think we need to do more to solve that issue,” DPS Commissioner Tindell said.
“It does create a situation where everybody has to pay more for insurance because there are so many people without it.”
Vehicle owners sue Securix
Securix used its program to identify and ticket the owners of uninsured vehicles, federal court records show. Data on insured motorists was essential to the program.
Under state law, Tindell’s office maintains the Mississippi Vehicle Insurance Verification System — bulk data on the state’s insured motorists that is regularly updated. DPS operates and maintains the system through third-party vendor HDI Solutions Inc.
Law enforcement officers use the system all the time. When they run a license plate, the system lets an officer know if the vehicle is insured. But agencies generally do not have access to HDI’s bulk data.
Initially, Commissioner Tindell was unwilling to commit his agency — and its HDI data — to the Securix program. 
“I don’t know that it’s necessarily the best policy to privatize our court system with diversion programs,” Tindell said. “I think those are government functions.”
Tindell also questioned whether a camera could be used to issue a ticket to an uninsured driver. State law says law enforcement agencies can access the system only during traffic stops and accident investigations. And state law forbids using the system’s insurance information as the only reason for a traffic stop.
He also was unsure whether a city could set up a diversion program through a private company.
For its initial foray into Mississippi with the city of Ocean Springs, Securix reached a data-sharing agreement directly with HDI, a letter from an HDI attorney shows.
“We basically said we’re not going to object to it,” Tindell said, “but that’s something y’all need to work out yourselves.”
With access to insured driver data, Securix began sending out citations from its Ocean Springs cameras.
If a vehicle was not listed as being insured, a ticket went to the owner. The system did not identify the person driving the vehicle.
On their face, the citations claimed to be uniform traffic tickets that, at first glance, appeared to be from the police department. 

Soon enough, Securix faced a federal lawsuit filed by three Mississippi residents ticketed as uninsured motorists. 
They are seeking class-action status to represent thousands of individuals who they believe received citations from Securix. In just a few months, the lawsuit says, 6,000 people were ticketed in Ocean Springs alone.
“Pretending to be law enforcement,” the lawsuit says,”defendant (Securix LLC) has made millions of dollars collecting fees from individuals who allegedly violated state uninsured vehicle laws.”
In a response filed in federal court, Securix denies any wrongdoing, saying the company “at all times acted in good faith” and followed state law.
The Ocean Springs citation offered three options: Call a toll-free number and provide proof of insurance, enter a diversion program that charges a $300 fee and includes a short online course and requires agreement that the vehicle will not be driven uninsured on public roadways, or contest the ticket in court and risk $510 in fines and fees, plus the potential of a one-year driver’s license suspension.
Court fight over uninsured motorist data
After signing the contract in Ocean Springs, Securix LLC began working with Josh Gregory and Robert Wilkinson to sign up other cities.
Company leaders convinced Pearl, Biloxi and Senatobia to join the program.  
Josh Gregory and Robert Wilkinson pitched the program in Senatobia, March 2022 minutes from the Board of Aldermen’s meeting show. Gregory told aldermen that 70% of the public response to the program was positive in Ocean Springs.
Senatobia even took the Department of Public Safety to Circuit Court, filing a lawsuit in Tate County that demanded access to the state agency’s insured driver data.
By the time the city and DPS reached a settlement agreement in August of 2023, HDI had cut off Securix’s access to insured driver data. 
An HDI attorney sent Securix LLC a default notice in December 2022. An HDI review showed Securix personnel issued citations in Ocean Springs without first having a police officer run the license plate information through the insurance verification system, a contract requirement, the notice said. 
The notice required Securix LLC to submit a corrective action plan and document the company’s future contract compliance. 
In March 2023, HDI terminated its agreement with Securix LLC. The termination letter said Securix had failed to respond to the notice of termination or submit a corrective action plan. Securix, through chairman Jonathan Miller, later maintained that an Ocean Springs police officer, not the company, authorized each citation.
Months later, the Securix settlement agreement with DPS stipulated that HDI would be authorized to once again provide Securix access to the insurance verification system.
Senatobia came to count on the revenue, board meeting minutes show. But the program would not last — in Senatobia or any other Mississippi city.
Securix program falls apart
In early August 2024, Tindell received a letter from Jonathan Miller of Securix LLC that raised questions about the way the program was operating, Tindell said.
“Based upon his letter, we had concerns that there wasn’t a proper law enforcement control system in place,” he said.
Tindell sent HDI a letter at the end of the same month that mentioned questions had been raised about the Securix program. Tindell asked HDI to “immediately discontinue sharing or providing data relating to any programs involving Securix or QJR.”
QJR filed its lawsuit to dissolve the company less than a month later. In the civil litigation, QJR is also alleging Miller has defamed the Mississippi business partners, which Miller has denied.
Although the chancery case is sealed, Securix and Securix Mississippi have been unable to avoid publicity.  E. Brian Rose, managing editor of the website GCWire and a former congressional candidate, has written numerous pieces about Securix’s business deals. 
But access to the Chancery Court file could give the public more information about the automatic license plate reading business.

In its motion to unseal the file, Mississippi Today attorney Henry Laird asks Harris to hold a hearing that gives the news outlet a chance to argue the file should be opened, as case law has established.
At the hearing, Harris would also need to consider alternatives to closing the file.
“Even if the on-the record-evidence would be so compelling so as to allow the court to redact specific documents or place them under seal,” Laird argues in his motion, quoting a pertinent case, that ‘does not warrant sealing the entire case  from public view’.”

Defense appeals with 2 days left,"Leonardo Bevilacqua, Lili Euzet and Mina Corpuz",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/23/federal-judge-okays-richard-jordans-execution-defense-appeals-with-2-days-left/,"With two days before the scheduled execution, Richard Jordan's attorneys appeal for clemency.","A federal judge is greenlighting the execution of Richard Jordan, limiting options to avoid execution by the death row inmate.
On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate denied a stay for the 79-year-old Jordan, who is one of the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the use of certain lethal injection drugs. Jordan’s execution is set for Wednesday at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. 
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County, and it took four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. He is the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate.
Jordan’s attorneys argued that Mississippi’s lethal injection protocol might constitute “cruel and unusual punishment,” under the 8th Amendment, arguing the sedative administered doesn’t prevent the inmate from feeling pain, suffocation and cardiac arrest.
“Mr. Jordan and all the other people on death row were sentenced to death to have their lives extinguished,” said Jim Craig of the MacArthur Justice Center at a June 14 hearing for a preliminary injunction to halt the execution. 
“They were not sentenced to be tortured before they die.”
But Wingate ruled that Jordan failed to prove the method of execution was “sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.”
He referred to a previous Supreme Court ruling which stated that “the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee the prisoner a painless death.”

A main point of contention in the hearing was the protocol the state would have to follow if the sedative failed to render Jordan unconscious.
Mississippi Department of Corrections lethal injection protocol requires execution staff to ensure inmates are completely unconscious before proceeding. The “proposed consciousness check” is a mandated wait time of three minutes between administering the sedative and the lethal drugs, according to court records. 
But the latest two executions in Mississippi – David Neal Cox on Nov. 17, 2021, and Thomas Loden on Dec. 14, 2022 – did not follow this protocol. Instead, execution staff waited one to two minutes before injecting the other drugs. 
At the June 14 hearing, citing a deposition from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain, the Attorney General’s Office assured Wingate that protocol would be followed with Jordan. It also promised to perform a “sternum rub” to check Jordan’s reaction to the painful stimuli.
“Ultimately, the record contains no evidence that either David Cox or Thomas Loden needlessly suffered prior to death by the same method of execution at issue here, and the Court finds that to be persuasive evidence against the issuance of a stay,” Wingate wrote on Friday. 
However, he issued a provision: the state has to stop Jordan’s execution if he shows signs of consciousness.
Although the clock is ticking, Jordan is not entirely out of options yet.

A petition for clemency was submitted to Gov. Tate Reeves’ counsel on Monday by Frank Rosenblatt, professor at Mississippi College school of Law. The petition highlights Jordan’s diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder from his two years of combat service in Vietnam. It cited a 2019 Missisisppi statute that asks courts to consider veterans’ PTSD during criminal sentencing.
“Prolonged exposure to machine gun fire is its own contributor to brain trauma in ways that alter brain behavior,” Rosenblatt explained. 
Reeves has never granted a petition for clemency before.
The U.S. Supreme Court also discussed on Wednesday whether to issue an emergency stay of execution, but has not released an opinion.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-06-23 11:11:26.497833

Janet Mills signed into law on Monday the budget passed by the Democratic majority of the Maine Legislature last week.  After initial conflicting votes, both chambers Wednesday night approved a roughly $320 million budget addition to the $11.3 billion biennial budget passed in March. “The budget bill enacted by the Legislature, like all lawmaking, […]","Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, Senate President Mattie Daughtry and Gov. Janet Mills listen to the State of the Judiciary address on Feb. 25, 2025. (Photo by James Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on Monday the budget passed by the Democratic majority of the Maine Legislature last week. 
After initial conflicting votes, both chambers Wednesday night approved a roughly $320 million budget addition to the $11.3 billion biennial budget passed in March.
“The budget bill enacted by the Legislature, like all lawmaking, is the product of various tradeoffs and compromises,” Mills said in a statement on Monday. “Although I might not agree with every single provision, I appreciate the diligence and hard work of the Appropriations Committee to produce this bill, which makes important investments in Maine families, children, and seniors, our higher education institutions, housing, and more.”
With Mills’ signature, the budget bill will take effect 90 days after the adjournment of the legislative session, a date that is not yet known as lawmakers are planning to return this week to finish work. 
The budget the Legislature passed defied several of the proposals Mills put forth earlier this year, including rejecting the governor’s proposed cuts to childcare programs and low-income food assistance, as well as proposed taxes on ambulances and pharmacies. The budget also effectively stops the state’s free community college program for future graduating classes, against the governor’s request to make it permanent. 
However, the plan includes Mills’ proposed tax additions on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes — the latter at an even higher amount than the governor requested. Read about more of the details of the plan here. 
Committee sets budget plan with party-line vote

“At a time when so much feels uncertain, this budget offers something solid: a commitment to the well-being of our communities and a hopeful vision for a stronger, more resilient Maine,” senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said in a statement Wednesday night. 
Her counterpart, Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), offered a different perspective. 
“We began the first regular session of the 132nd Legislature six months ago with news of a severe budget shortfall. It is truly concerning that legislative Democrats are continuing with this reckless path,” Stewart said in a statement Wednesday night. “The Democrat majority has seized every opportunity to spend more at the expense of Maine’s taxpayers. I have a very simple question for my Democrat counterparts: at what point will you wake up and realize enough is enough?”
While added appropriations total about $320 million, the bill has a lower fiscal note, $117 million, due to a range of cost cutting measures — taxes, some cuts, and transferring unexpected surpluses. The net cost is also lower than the roughly $127 million that remained after the initial budget passed in March, which had continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding to fill the MaineCare deficit and other urgent needs.
The Democratic majority also pushed through that two-year budget plan in March without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days, which was Friday. 
While the continued party-line divide in Augusta remains clear, the initial votes on the budget addition last week illuminated some divisions within the Democratic majority. 
Six progressive Democrats in the House initially voted against the budget, arguing for their colleagues to reject regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on people with lower incomes, and instead push for a model that taxes the wealthy more — even if the governor, who has opposed any income-based tax reform, ultimately vetoes it. But five of the six representatives later backed the budget, allowing it to pass. 
There is a bill currently in limbo that proposes such a change. Referred to as a “millionaire’s tax,” LD 1089 would place a tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers to be used to fund public K-12 education. After both chambers rejected the bill in initial votes, the Senate reversed its stance last week, sending the measure back to the House to reconsider. It remains tabled. 
There are several bills that similarly remain in a state of uncertainty between the chambers — including proposals for a comprehensive data privacy law — that lawmakers could consider when they return sometime this week to finish work.
About 300 bills that have passed both chambers are also in limbo on what’s called the appropriations table. The appropriations committee, which manages this table, will ultimately decide which proposals to fund with any remaining unappropriated money.
Some of those proposals are bills to establish a task force to suggest reform to the real estate property tax, ensure the already required teaching of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively taught in Maine schools, provide more funding for family planning services, fund proper disposal of syringe litter and expand testing for forever chemicals in private wells, among others.

Some remember that they also settled Greenland, misled by Erik the Red’s skillful marketing into colonizing one of the least green places on earth. 
But today, almost no Greenlanders are of Scandinavian extraction. Though still administered by Denmark, the island’s population is over 90% Inuit. So what happened to the Vikings?
Author Jared Diamond in his work Collapse argues they vanished due to two linked causes: climate change and cultural rigidity. The Norse arrived in Greenland during a global warm period, when their traditional methods of farming and cattle-raising could meet their subsistence needs, though tenuously. As the climate cooled, these methods became unviable. Instead of adapting to Inuit techniques like seal hunting, the Greenland Norse clung to what they knew. Slowly, their society withered. Most returned to Europe, a small number assimilated, and the remainder died; freezing in wooden homes they refused to abandon for the igloos that would have kept them alive.
Like the Vikings, we face a changing climate today, and like them, we risk refusing to adapt. One of the clearest symbols of our cultural rigidity is our attachment to cars and the sprawling infrastructure that must be built to accommodate them.
Connecticut’s HB 5002, a housing bill recently passed by the legislature, aimed to push back against this by lifting parking mandates for small-scale residential developments. But its implementation now hangs in the balance, as opponents on both the left and right cling to one question: “Where will we park?” 
This bipartisan resistance appears to be rooted in common sense, but is shortsighted. In an era of climate change, housing scarcity, and dysfunctional transportation systems, it’s exactly this kind of inflexible attachment to tradition that threatens our future.
We’re told that cars are convenient, even essential. But anyone who’s lived in Connecticut knows that that convenience is a myth. Visit any highway –I-95, 91, 84 –and you will most likely be at a dead-stop at least once. For 25 years, my father drove a commute that should have taken 30 minutes but almost always stretched past an hour. 
Five days a week, for decades, he sat idly in a metal box, losing precious hours in excruciating traffic. Multiply that by thousands of lives across the state and you begin to see the scale of the loss; of time, energy, and connection. Even putting aside the lack of convenience, cars are dangerous. America’s love of hulking vehicles kills tens of thousands every year, despite advances in safety features, and emits roughly 28% of America’s total carbon output. In the face of these drawbacks, we still cling to the myth of the personal automobile because we assume that the alternatives are too impractical.
HB 5002 includes a provision to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for small-scale residential development. Basically, it gives builders the freedom to build homes without being forced to design around cars. Its opponents insist that more housing will make traffic worse, but they misunderstand the issue. 
The only way to reduce traffic is to reduce the need for cars. Parking requirements that force developers to sprawl their buildings, separate land uses, and decrease density kills walkability, makes biking unappealing, and handicaps public transportation. If we want less traffic and fewer emissions, we have to stop designing everything around where the car will go. Let developers decide if parking is necessary, and let the rest of us step into the sunshine and stretch our legs for a change.
Connecticut needs more housing. Its lack of affordable housing options is pushing those who have the means to flee to other states, and those who don’t out onto the street. HB 5002 addresses this crisis by rationalizing the regulatory landscape, freeing us from outdated planning that elevates car travel. By easing parking mandates, it opens the door to a new kind of Connecticut, where people can walk to get groceries, bike to the movies, or take the train to the airport. Yet opposition to this bill reveals a deeper resistance: not just to the policy itself, but to change. Sometimes we cling to the past without considering whether that past is worth preserving.
Some defend America’s car-centric culture as a matter of tradition. But tradition is not automatically a virtue, nor does it only strengthen societies. The Qing emperors dismissed European traders as uncultured barbarians, until they were overrun by those same barbarians wielding cutting-edge industrial technology. Throughout history we see that great powers fall due to ritualized stagnation. When cultural habit replaces solutions-oriented curiosity, decline follows. Parking minimums are a ritual: an unquestioned norm that blocks progress. It may seem small, but it represents a stumbling block to our nation’s continued prosperity. 
Unless we embrace change over sentimental custom, America may very well go the way of the old Chinese Dynasties and the Greenland Vikings: dominated by younger, more ambitious states, or quietly disappearing into the pages of history.

Washington has sponsored a bill banning hair discrimination for years in the Missouri State Legislature (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri could soon join 27 states with laws protecting natural hair textures, though the anti-discrimination provisions only apply to educational settings.
The legislation, dubbed the CROWN Act, has been proposed in Missouri since 2020 and is part of a national movement to enshrine protections for curls and coils. The cities of St. Louis and Kansas City have local ordinances banning hair discrimination.
Missouri lawmakers passed a version of the CROWN Act in May as part of a larger bill, and it awaits Gov. Mike Kehoe’s decision on whether to sign it or issue a veto. 
California was the first state to enact a prohibition on hair discrimination in 2019. According to Google Trends, this was around when the public became aware of the CROWN Act. In the year prior, instances of hair discrimination circulated national media, like reports of a young wrestler who was forced to shave his locks to compete.
Democratic state Sen. Barbara Washington of Kansas City, who sponsored the Senate version of the CROWN Act, called out this story during the Senate’s debate of the bill in February. Children should not lose part of their educational and extracurricular experience, she said, “simply because they chose to wear their hair in braids or an afro or dreadlocks.”
The legislation applies to any preschool, K-12 and higher education institution that receives state funds.
The issue is personal to her, Washington said. As a reporter and lawyer earlier in her career, she was told to straighten her hair, and she was turned down from a job because of her curls.
The only opposition in the chamber came from state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, who thought it was unnecessary to enshrine the protections.
Other versions of the CROWN Act have faced larger criticism in the state legislature because they extend beyond education. State Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, a St. Louis Democrat, filed two bills this year seeking to expand the state’s definition of employment discrimination to include “traits historically associated with race including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles.”
Neither bill was even referred to a House committee until the final days of session, when there was no time left for a hearing. 
In prior years, state lawmakers worried that the employment provision would spur lawsuits for employers. They also discussed safety concerns, with some professions requiring hair nets or other measures.
The bill passed this year allows for classes to require protective headgear, like hairnets, for classes like home economics and woodworking.
The legislation did not pass as a standalone bill but was added as an amendment on a package with anti-discrimination and anti-hazing provisions.

Younger brothers, John and Andy, went to public schools  in Colchester,  moving to Porter’s Point in new home after Kathy married Ray Clavelle in 1976.

Kathy was a very enthusiastic participant in everything, but her passion was reading as a kid. Later, cooking, then gardening, raising a family w/ her one true love, Raymie (they had two sons)…later, two grandsons…
We as kids all loved sunshine* and warmth, so water and swimming was a must….

(Kansas Department of Commerce)TOPEKA — Community development financial institutions support “underserved” small businesses and entrepreneurs who may have challenges accessing capital through traditional means, a CDFI leader says.
Ruben Alonso, CEO of AltCap, a nonprofit CDFI based in Kansas City, Missouri, talked about the importance of access to capital in for people and communities that have been traditionally underserved by traditional financing options on the Kansas Reflector podcast.
“There are about 1,500 CDFIs in the country, but all of them are really charged with supporting communities, bringing capital to underserved, overlooked communities,” Alonso said. “Some of them focus on supporting small businesses. We very much are focused on bringing capital to entrepreneurs or businesses that fall outside the financial mainstream.”


Other CDFIs may focus on financing community centers, health centers or charter schools, he said. CDFIs were created by the U.S. Department of Treasury, and its CDFI Fund division oversees the financial institutions, Alonso said.
Alonso recently attended the launch of the Kansas Small Business Office, a new division in the Kansas Department of Commerce, to share information about CDFI financing available in Kansas. He said CDFIs have “flown a little bit under the radar” in Kansas.
The U.S. Treasury reports Kansas has received 19 CDFI awards, compared to 288 in Missouri, 247 in Colorado, 215 in Oklahoma and 87 in Nebraska.
“Kansas, I think, has been a little bit of a CDFI desert,” Alonso said. “Those CDFI resources come in the form of small business loans, micro loans, like we provide. But there’s also other resources, like tax credit financing, just other kinds of grant dollars, that the state of Kansas could be getting.”
Alonso said AltCap is working with the Kansas Small Business Office to market more consistently in the state to raise awareness of CDFI funding.
The mission-driven work of CDFIs breaks into two buckets, he said.
“It’s very people-based and place-based in terms of how we’re trying to bring capital or provide capital to communities and to individuals,” he said. “On the people side, just historically there have been some disparities in lending that exist with our traditional financial institutions or traditional banking system. For example, entrepreneurs of color or women entrepreneurs have had challenges accessing capital for a lot of different reasons.”
Alonso said statistics bear that out, with data showing that when a woman receives a bank loan, she is more likely to get less than what she requested and at a higher interest rate.
“Those are disparities that we’re trying to address,” he said. “We support all entrepreneurs, but we really want to focus on those entrepreneurs that have historically had challenges accessing traditional capital, or accessing capital from traditional financial institutions like banks.”
On the place-based side of CDFI lending, Alonso said the history of redlining has made it difficult for some communities to access capital. 
Redlining was the racist practice of grading neighborhoods in terms of viability for lending money, resulting in areas that received little to no investment. The practice created disparities in social, economic and environmental conditions that continue today, according to the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond.
“We don’t do it alone,” Alonso said. “We have great partnerships and relationships with banks to ensure that any entrepreneur or any community has the opportunity to access capital if they need to.”
Applying for a CDFI loan is similar to applying for a bank loan, but the rules may not be as defined, Alonso said. 
“We will look at a lot of the same things that banks look at, like your credit score. It’s not something that drives our lending decisions, like a lot of traditional financial institutions,” he said. “You could have a low credit score with us, and it’s not going to be an immediate disqualifier.”
A CDFI lender would dig into why the credit score was low and look at many other factors, Alonso said. 
It’s also important that businesses understand lending options so they avoid things like accessing capital through credit cards with high interest rates or through more risky options, Alonso said. 
“A lot of what AltCap does is refinance small businesses or entrepreneurs out of those online loans, because they quickly realize how expensive those loans are,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ruben-Alonso-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 10:08:50.247201

97, 99, 96 – those are the high temperatures expected for the state’s capital, Dover, for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
With a heat wave expected to blanket Delaware in the coming days, the state’s Division of Public Health (DPH) is warning residents to take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses, especially among the most vulnerable populations.
According to the National Weather Service, Delaware will face dangerously high temperatures and humidity levels, raising the risk of heat exhaustion and other serious conditions.
In response, health officials are offering tips and resources to help residents stay safe.
READ: Delaware officials urge caution as peak tick season begins
Extreme heat can pose a serious health threat to anyone, but certain groups—including infants, older adults, pregnant individuals, and pets—are at significantly higher risk.
Who’s most at risk?

Infants and children often can’t communicate their discomfort or regulate body temperature as efficiently as adults.
Older adults may have difficulty adjusting to temperature changes, especially those on certain medications or with chronic health issues.
Pregnant individuals face added strain as their bodies work to cool both themselves and their unborn children.
Pets, particularly those that are very young, old, or have darker coats or health conditions, are also at risk and should be kept cool and well-hydrated.

Outdoor workers, individuals with chronic medical conditions, and those without access to air conditioning or proper shelter are also urged to take extra precautions.
Heat safety tips
To reduce the risk of heat-related illness, DPH advises Delawareans to:

Stay cool by seeking out air-conditioned spaces such as malls, libraries, or designated cooling centers.
Dress appropriately in light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.
Limit outdoor activity, especially during the hottest parts of the day. If being outside is unavoidable, take frequent breaks and stay in the shade when possible.
Protect pets, avoiding walks during peak heat hours and checking pavement temperature with your hand before taking them out.
Hydrate frequently, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Avoid sugary or alcoholic drinks, which can contribute to dehydration.
Never leave children or pets in parked cars, where temperatures can become deadly in minutes—even with windows cracked.

DPH also pointed residents to resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including a Heat & Health Tracker for localized conditions, and the National Weather Service’s seven-day heat risk outlook.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-23-at-9.01.48-AM.png,,,2025-06-23 10:08:50.247201

(State of Alaska image)The federal Board of Geographic Names has rejected a proposal to name a summit in Denali National Park and Preserve after a longtime mining pioneer.
Michele Stevens, daughter of Carola June Young, proposed naming the peak “Mount Carola” to honor her mother, and the proposal had been supported by the Talkeetna Historical Society, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough Planning Commission, the Alaska Miners Association and the Alaska Historical Commission, which voted 6-1 to support the nomination.
But on June 12, the domestic names committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names rejected the nomination. The board, along with the secretary of the interior, is responsible for maintaining geographic names in the country.
Wendy Sailors, community engagement manager for Alaska State Parks, said that the federal board rejected the Mount Carola name because it violated the policy for names in wilderness areas. 
That policy states in part that the board “will not approve proposed names for unnamed features within wilderness areas, including unpublished names in local use, unless an overriding need can be demonstrated by the proponent.”
The unnamed mountain that was to be christened Mount Carola is located just inside the southern border of Denali National Park, inside an “eligible wilderness” area.
That area was added to the original McKinley National Park in 1980 as part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
Eligible wilderness is not designated wilderness but is managed to preserve its wilderness character, according to National Park Service policy.
Sailors said that the National Park Service did not support the Mount Carola name, and its opposition was shared with federal board members before the final vote.
It is somewhat unusual for an Alaska name nomination to be rejected at the federal level because names must be vetted by the Alaska Historical Commission beforehand.
In December, the federal board approved the names for Arkose Peak and Souvenir Peak in the Hatcher Pass Planning Area. Those names had been suggested by local skiers and mountaineers to clear up a discrepancy between local use and what was actually listed on the map.
On July 10, the board is expected to take up the renaming of “Nazi Creek” and “Nip Hill” in the Aleutians. Those landmarks, on the southeastern side of Little Kiska Island, were federally named in World War II and are expected to be renamed using local Unangax terminology.
Both are located within the Aleutian Islands Wilderness of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.

On Jan. 13, 1976, he said it felt like any other day when he left for his Catholic school in Gulfport and his younger brother Kevin stayed home with their mother Edwina. Then he remembers he and his brother staying with family friends and being told his parents had to go out of town. 
Days later, his father and a priest told them their mother was dead. 
When Marter was older, he learned details about his mother’s murder and some about the man responsible for her death: Richard Jordan. 
Jordan, 79, the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, has had multiple trials and execution dates set that have come and gone. He has continued to fight his death sentence through appeals and a lawsuit challenging the state’s use of lethal injection drugs. Each time, Edwina Marter’s family has testified in court and endured hearing about details of her death again. 
Marter said he hasn’t made Jordan’s legal process a major focus in his life. He doesn’t have interest in witnessing his execution set for June 25 at Parchman, and neither does his father or brother. Instead, Marter’s uncle is expected to attend with his family. 
But he still wants to see the sentence carried out and believes it should have happened sooner, not almost 50 years after the fact. He also believes Jordan’s execution would guarantee that he has no chance of leaving prison. 
“I don’t want him to get what he wants,” said Marter, who is 59 and lives in Lafayette, Louisiana. 
“If you want to spend the rest of your life in jail, then I would rather you not get that, and if that means you get executed, you get executed.”

Edwina Marter grew up in Metairie, Louisiana, with two sisters and a brother. She went to college at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where she met her husband Charles.
They started their family in Louisiana and later relocated to Gulfport, where Charles Marter worked as a banker. Their next son, Kevin, was born on the Coast. 
In 1976, Jordan, a Vietnam veteran whose attorneys say suffers from PTSD, was desperate for money and thought of kidnapping someone and demanding money. He called the bank where Charles Marter was the commercial loan agent, and found the man’s address in the phonebook. Jordan went to their home, impersonating an electric company worker to get 34-year-old Edwina Marter to open the door. 
Once she did, Jordan took her and left her younger son unarmed. He had her drive to the DeSoto National Forest where he shot her in the head when she tried to run away. Afterward, Jordan called Edwina’s husband to demand $25,000 in ransom money. He was not successful in getting it and was arrested. 
Marter said his family moved back to Louisiana after his mother’s death and did not live in Mississippi again. His father did not mention his mother’s death.
“He did the best he could and the way he knew how to raise two boys by himself was to make sure we didn’t get in trouble,” Marter said. 
Milestones like graduations, marriage and children came along. Marter became a banker like his father, and his brother joined the Army. Somewhere along the way, Marter said he wondered what it would be like if his mother were around for them. 
“I don’t really try to dwell on it too much,” he said. 
In 1976, Jordan went to trial and received a death sentence, only for it to be overturned multiple times due to questions about the legality of Mississippi’s death penalty law. It wasn’t until 1998 and four trials later that the sentence stuck. 
Charles Marter, who is now 88, testified in several of the trials. Neither of the Marter sons attended the early trials, and the adults didn’t share much details with them. Once Eric Marter was older, he said he asked for more information about his mother’s death from his aunts and uncle. 
With his own sons, Marter told them that their grandmother died when he was young. When they had questions as they were older, Marter shared some basics about what happened.  
Over the years, Mississippi and Louisiana reporters have spoken with Edwina’s family members about Jordan’s multiple trials and death sentences, appeals and executions that have not been carried out. 
In reflecting after Jordan’s 1998 conviction, Charles Marter told the Sun Herald that his family was elated about the first conviction, only to become less confident after multiple trials.
2001 story in The Sun Herald in Biloxi on the Edwina Marter murder case.
Mary deGruy, Edwina’s older sister, praised the work of then-special prosecutor Joe Sam Owen, who worked on Jordan’s case for over 25 years. 
“This is just something that stays on your mind forever,” she told the Sun Herald in 2001.  “We just hope and pray that one day (Jordan) will die in prison. They just need to follow through with the death penalty.”

As immigration raids continue to rattle California small businesses, farms and communities, CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Mikhail Zinshteyn take a look at how public sentiment towards immigration has changed dramatically in California over the past few decades — and what that could mean under a federal administration that pledges to conduct the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.
In 1994 Californians passed Proposition 187 with 58% of the vote. The measure, backed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, barred undocumented immigrants from using taxpayer-funded schools, social services and non-emergency medical care. 
A federal judge voided the measure shortly after it passed, but its legacy endures. Prop. 187 galvanized Latino voters and served as a watershed moment for some aspiring Latino political leaders.
Over the course of 31 years, public opinion on immigration policy shifted: When asked whether immigrants are a “benefit” or a “burden” to the state, more Californians each decade regarded immigrants as a benefit, according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California. In 2017 California passed sanctuary state laws, and lawmakers have steadily expanded Medi-Cal eligibility to immigrants without legal status.
But as California faces another multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, the call to roll back Medi-Cal’s expansion is growing. In addition to Republican legislators, 58% of Californians surveyed oppose health coverage for undocumented immigrants. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants in his latest budget plan as well.
The continued presence of California National Guard in Los Angeles also underscores the combatting views surrounding the role of immigrants in the state and the U.S. Last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt Newsom a setback after it determined that President Donald Trump legally deployed the troops in L.A., according to Mikhail. 
On Friday, the federal judge who initially ruled to pause Trump’s deployment requested a briefing from both sides by today that could give Newsom’s legal team an opportunity to propose an alternative argument of whether Trump’s troop mobilization violates federal law.

Who’s paying for PG&E CEO’s bodyguards?

Pacific Gas & Electric within the last three months has twice hired personnel to protect its CEO, amid the wake of the fatal December shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, reports CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
But the utility company declined to answer CalMatters’ questions about how much it spends on bodyguards, whether its leadership has received any specific threats and whether shareholders or customers are footing the security costs. 
Some advocacy groups and business experts say that PG&E’s hiring of protection staff raises concerns about its response to negative public sentiment. In addition to increasing rates several times in 2024, PG&E is associated with many wildfires, including pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter for victims of 2018’s Camp Fire.
Timothy Pollock, a business professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, says that if the public is upset at a company and beefing up security is its response to that anger, “that would tell me they don’t really understand what the issue is.”

Paying LA community college students to go to school

Though a handful of regions in California have experimented with guaranteed income programs, few programs target college students, and even fewer reach community college students.
But as Amy Elisabeth Moore of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network explains, Building Outstanding Opportunities for Students to Thrive, or BOOST, is unique because it provides $1,200 a month for one year to eligible community college students majoring in a health care field.
The program seeks to address the state’s nursing shortage, providing stipends for students in the Los Angeles Community College District as they complete their degrees and after when they transition into their careers. 
About half the students in the district report incomes at or below poverty level. For Brenda Olazava, who is transferring to Cal State Los Angeles to study psychology, the program helps with bills, giving her more time to study and spend time with her two teenage kids. 

Olazava: “Just being a single mom, it’s just overwhelming financial needs all the time.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)McCOOK LAKE — Morgan and Malcom Speichinger still live in a house that was damaged in a flood one year ago, because they have no better option.
“If we could afford to move, we would,” Morgan said. 
Three days of rain last June 20-22 in southeast South Dakota surpassed 17 inches in some locations. Local and state authorities implemented a half-century-old diversion plan to handle record-high water that was flowing down the Big Sioux River toward Sioux City. They built a temporary levee across Interstate 29 that tied in with permanent levees to divert water into McCook Lake.
The water was supposed to flow through the lake and drain toward the nearby Missouri River. Instead, on the night of June 23, it overwhelmed the lake and inundated many of the homes around it. Many residents said the flood surge came suddenly, after they’d received little to no warning.
The water carved deep ravines into the land, undercutting trees and power lines. The Speichingers’ home was one of more than 100 near the lake that were damaged. Twenty homes were destroyed.

While the family received the maximum $42,500 of assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they estimate they’ve spent about $100,000, and work on the home remains. 
“We got a Bobcat and did what we could,” Malcom said, referring to a  popular brand of skid-steer loader. “But our yard’s still a trench. It’s not that safe for the kids.”
Their mortgage lender granted a six-month forbearance after the flood, but they’ve had to make payments since then on a house that was barely habitable.
“There was a stretch where we met with a bankruptcy lawyer,” Morgan said. “We didn’t think we’d make it. If FEMA hadn’t come through, we would’ve walked away like our neighbors did.”
‘We have nothing’: Flood victims say government failures continue after botched flood warning

Three nearby homes were either abandoned or demolished.
In interviews with flood victims and volunteers, a picture emerges one year after the flood: a community still deeply wounded, still struggling with limited resources, and still lacking the kind of assistance that many assumed would follow such a large-scale disaster.
Renae Hansen of the local Izaak Walton League helped lead local recovery efforts. 
“When a flood like that happens, you expect some official to show up with a megaphone and a plan,” Hansen said. “Instead, it was us — neighbors helping neighbors. We did it because nobody else was.”
The sense of abandonment still runs deep. The feeling began the night of the flood, after then-Gov. Kristi Noem conducted a press conference that afternoon and did not advise McCook Lake residents to evacuate.  She said they should protect their personal property, “because we do anticipate that they will take in water.”
“That’s what we’re preparing for,” Noem said. “If we don’t, then that’s wonderful that they don’t have an impact, but they could see water flowing into McCook Lake.”

After the press conference, Noem flew to a political fundraiser in Tennessee, which is where she was when the flood surge hit McCook Lake and sent people fleeing. During the aftermath, Noem refused to deploy the National Guard to help clean up the area, after she’d sent Guard troops multiple times to help Texas secure its border with Mexico.
Noem later resigned to become secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security, which includes oversight of FEMA. New Gov. Larry Rhoden recently visited North Sioux City as part of his “Open for Opportunity Tour.”
“Our new governor went to a business in town and called it a success story,” Hansen said. “He didn’t come to see the disaster zone. It’s like we don’t exist. We were sacrificed to protect those businesses.”
Like the Speichingers, Hansen said the maximum $42,500 of help from FEMA is hardly enough to replace a foundation, much less an entire home.
“There are families paying mortgages on homes that no longer exist,” Hansen said. “One woman had moved in 11 months before the flood. Her last furniture delivery was two weeks before the water came. It’s all gone.”
Hansen said some neighbors are walking away from their mortgages, renting a new place, and choosing a damaged credit score over paying for a destroyed home. 
Multiple residents worked with a lawyer and sent the state a notice of a potential lawsuit, alleging an unconstitutional taking of private property for protection of other areas, but no lawsuit has been filed so far.
‘Every time it rains, you wonder’
Kathy Roberts, who owns a home on Penrose Drive, calls herself one of the “lucky ones.” With a partner who had construction experience and support from friends, she has nearly finished rebuilding.
“But I’m still having nightmares,” said Roberts, who works in mental health. “And I know my neighbors are, too. There’s PTSD all over this community. Every time it rains, you wonder.”

Malcom Speichinger can attest to that.
“I’ve had dreams where the house floods again. It’s hard not to go there.”
He’s certain the area will have severe flooding again.
“And we’re still not ready for it,” he said.
New government, new plan
In the wake of the disaster, residents petitioned to overhaul the North Sioux City government. Voters replaced the eight-member alderman system with a new mayor-commission format. That allowed voters to elect an entirely new commission and mayor in one election. And in April, a new mayor and commissioners were sworn in.
“There’s some hope there now,” Hansen said. “We’ve already seen more engagement from the new commission. But the fact that it took a total government reset to get basic attention should tell you how bad things got.”
At the heart of residents’ frustration lies the emergency flood plan last updated in 1976 — one that sent floodwaters into the McCook Lake neighborhood intentionally, in an effort to divert it from the more heavily populated areas of North Sioux City and Dakota Dunes. 
And so, two months into his term, North Sioux City Mayor Chris Bogenrief said implementing a new mitigation plan is at the top of his agenda.
Bogenrief said the county and the Army Corps of Engineers envision a diversion farther upstream on the Big Sioux River. But he said that effort is still in the early study stages and could take a decade or more to materialize.
“We don’t feel like we can wait that long,” he said. “People are trying to rebuild.”

So, the city commissioned Stockwell Engineers to explore three short-term plans. 
“We’re applying for hazard mitigation grants from FEMA to help cover the cost,” Bogenrief said. “But one way or another, we can’t sit around and wait.”
McCook Lake is an oxbow — a horseshoe-shaped former segment of the Missouri River that became a lake when the river cut a new, straighter path. The first two short-term concepts would use a new channel and culvert system to better route water into McCook Lake and out through one end or the other of the lake. The third would reroute floodwaters to the west prior to reaching McCook Lake, and into undeveloped Goodenough and Mud lakes before draining into the Missouri River. 
Bogenrief said the cost estimate for implementing a short-term plan is up to $20 million. The design cost of the projects is about $1.7 million, he said, with North Sioux City expected to cover about 10% and FEMA covering the rest. 
The state has drafted a $15.4 million plan to help communities recover from the 2024 flooding. The plan would utilize federal Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds to rebuild infrastructure in areas hardest hit.

The plan proposes spending more than $12 million on infrastructure projects like road repairs, stormwater systems, and improvements to McCook Lake. The rest is for future planning and administration.
The plan says the unmet recovery need in the state still totals more than $63 million. That includes $3.1 million categorized as owner-occupied damage, with the rest dealing with infrastructure.
Bogenrief hopes the city can free up local money to start a homeowner recovery fund as those infrastructure dollars come in. 
Many residents lacked flood insurance, Bogenrief said, because FEMA did not classify the area as a floodplain.
“The only way it floods is if the emergency flood plan is executed and the interstate is shut down, which is what happened,” he said.
A lake full of everything
The state Department of Game, Fish and Parks awarded a $1 million contract to Three Oaks Inc. to remove debris and sediment from the lake, said the department’s Kip Rounds. The department is tasked with managing the lake cleanup effort because it manages the waters of the state.
Using an excavator on a floating barge, the company is three weeks into a project scheduled to finish by Aug. 1. Rounds said the contractor is nearly halfway though removing an estimated 20,000 cubic yards of sediment.

McCook Lake Association President Dirk Lohry said there’s other work to do. He said local residents hope to raise $250,000 to extend Three Oaks’ work, but that campaign hasn’t launched. A funding request to extend the contract with state money failed during the recent legislative session.
Lake resident Kathy Roberts said the road to healing is a long one, but she sees one clear takeaway.
“This flood taught me how important your neighbors are,” she said. “When the worst happens, it’s not FEMA or the state that shows up — it’s the person living next door.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EM8A2910-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-06-23 09:03:46.681156

Act 44, signed by Gov. Jeff Landry earlier this month, expands the power of the state’s economic development agency to make changes to the incentive program — a program whose proponents say is crucial in bringing productions to the state.
“This bill will allow us to further develop our incentive toolkit so that we can increase our competitiveness with other states,” said Chris Stelly, director of legislative affairs for Louisiana Economic Development.
Economic factors have hurt the film industry nationwide in recent years, and Louisiana’s industry has experienced a significant decrease in activity. According to Louisiana Entertainment, only one production was active in the state as of May 20.
Officials with LED, the agency which oversees the film tax credit program, hopes the new law will give them flexibility with the program to attract more business to the state.
Verite News spoke with Louisiana’s film industry leaders and insiders to understand the implications of the law and what it could mean for the future of the film industry in “Hollywood South.”

What’s changed?
Louisiana’s motion picture production program uses tax credits to incentivize productions to film in the state. The credits reduce what production companies pay in taxes. Louisiana is one of 37 states that offer a film incentive, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Louisiana was the first state to adopt a film tax credit in 1992. The first iteration of the modern program was adopted in 2002 when LED began administering it.
Under the new law, qualified productions can receive a tax credit of up to 40% of total production expenditures. The program provides a base credit, previously capped at 25%, with additional smaller incentives for filming outside of New Orleans, employing Louisiana residents, performing visual effects services in-state. An incentive is also available for screenplays created by Louisiana residents. The program also gives production companies tax credits for employees on payroll.
A company can use the credit as payment for income tax liability or transfer the credit back to the state and receive a refund check.
The new law doesn’t change the total dollar value of credits the state can issue annually. Louisiana can issue up to $125 million in credits per fiscal year.
Prior to the new law, changing the program required changing state law. Now, LED has more power to adjust the program on its own terms using an administrative rulemaking process.
“LED is looking for more opportunities to make deals ,and they don’t want to have to have the whims of the fiscal session every two years to go in and do that,” said Jason Waggenspack, president of the industry group Film Louisiana.
Waggenspack said Film Louisiana worked with LED on the legislation.
Although the law doesn’t significantly change the current incentive program, it does remove the credit caps per project and payroll caps per person.
“We took both of those away to allow for the inclusion for bigger projects, which we had a wealth of large projects for several years here in Louisiana [and] we wanted to obviously see that opportunity coming back,” Waggenspack said.
Why did industry leaders want to improve the program?
With more power to amend the program rules, LED plans to adjust the program to be more responsive to evolving industry trends compared to when changes were enacted by the legislature.
LED is also looking to negotiate deals with production companies that the development agency believes bring long-term investments to the state. Such a deal could include raising a production’s base credit or adjusting the per person payroll credits.
Waggenspack pointed to rapper 50 Cent’s G-Unit Films and Television production company, which is building a studio in Shreveport. Waggenspack said 50 Cent is looking to negotiate a deal.
“[If] you want to come and bring long-term projects here … let’s talk to the state and find out a way that it makes it more financially available for you,” Waggenspack said.
Now, proposed changes to the program will go through the rulemaking process, which includes a public hearing and approval from legislative committees, among other steps.
The law also allows for an emergency rulemaking process. Waggenspack said Film Louisiana is currently working with LED on deciding which parts of the program may need to be amended using this process, and a decision will be made in the coming weeks.
Why is Louisiana’s film market struggling?
Josh Penn, founder and CEO of the New Orleans production company Department of Motion Pictures, said the film market is in upheaval right now. It’s not a problem unique to Louisiana, but the state has “been hit especially hard,” he said.
While production costs are rising, Penn said the revenue model is collapsing, largely due to the decline of theatrical and cable TV as reliable revenue and the takeover of streaming. More and more, productions are shooting overseas to minimize costs, which has contributed to a decline in film jobs in Louisiana over the past few years.
“The new law has the potential to bring significant business and jobs back to the state — if it can truly deliver the most competitive tax credit and bottom-line value for films and studios,” Penn said in an emailed statement.
But he’s worried about the implications of giving LED broad discretionary power on a project-by-project basis. Although it gives the agency flexibility to pursue high-value projects, the “intentional vagueness” of the law could create instability and confusion, he said.
“If filmmakers can’t clearly understand what they can 100% count on from Louisiana’s incentives, they may choose to shoot elsewhere,” he said.
He’s also worried about the implications of allowing a state agency to decide which projects are worth incentivizing and which ones aren’t.
“The most troubling interpretation is that it could be used as a political tool of the governor’s office or other political officials, with projects rewarded or punished based on their subject matter or the individuals involved,” Penn said.
Sen. Adam Bass, R-Bossier City, the sponsor of the legislation, did not respond to a request for comment.
Connor Sullivan is a freelance contractor who manages film crews working on episodic series. He said he has only worked a handful of days in 2025 and hasn’t had full-time work since 2024. Many of his peers in the industry struggled to find work even earlier than that, he said.
“I and everyone else that I know have been spending savings and really going into some pretty deep debt to try to keep afloat as we navigate what the future looks like,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan said he’s cautiously optimistic about the law and hopes that it will clear up the “mixed messaging” he said the state legislature has been sending about the sustainability of the program in Louisiana over the years.
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 478, which represents film and television crew workers in the region, supports the new law.
“[Act 44] strengthens our ability to attract consistent production, grow local businesses, and create stable, long-term jobs in one of the state’s most impactful creative industries,” union representative Simonette Berry said in a statement.
Waggenspack said that the film industry has been a significant driver of tourism in Louisiana. He referenced “Twilight: Breaking Dawn” and “True Detective” as productions that fostered interest among fans in visiting the state.
“When True Detective was filmed here and became a juggernaut of a [series], we had people calling the New Orleans film office asking, ‘Where can I see the tour for the True Detective movie?’ And it’s like, well, we don’t have a tour for that, but we would love the opportunity to take advantage of those things,” he said.
How has the program changed?
“In research for this bill, one of the things that really stuck out to me — this incentive and statute has changed 30 times in the last 33 years. So it continues to change, it continues to morph. And it is not incredibly agile,” said the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Adam Bass, R-Bossier City, during a May committee hearing.
The program has expanded and contracted over the years, including in 2015 when the program — which at the time had averaged $271 million in credits since 2011 — was capped at $180 million. The same 2015 law also suspended the program’s buyback provision for one year, meaning some productions couldn’t receive refunds on the credits they had earned.
Critics, including some fiscal conservative groups, have scrutinized the program and its purported benefits in past years. A 2017 report by an economist for LED found that Louisiana taxpayers got a return of 22 cents on the dollar for the program, which was thriving at the time.
When the state issues tax credits, it expects to recoup lost revenue in part through an increase in economic activity that a production brings to an area, such as hotel accommodations and restaurants. Individual taxpayers can also make up the difference.
Louisiana’s film tax credit program was at risk of elimination during November’s special session as part of a broader tax reform effort led by the governor.
The bill to end the program passed the House, but a Senate committee later saved the tax credits. The compromise to keep the program involved lowering the cap from $150 million to $125 million per year.
A move to eliminate the program would have been detrimental to the film industry in Louisiana, industry insiders say.

Ameer Habeeb
Ameer Habeeb is Environmental Services Director for PRIDE Industries at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville and an Air Force veteran.


I’m one of 60 people who clean the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. We are veterans, people with disabilities and people who have overcome addiction and trauma to build stable, self-sufficient lives for ourselves and our families.
Our jobs, which we got through PRIDE Industries, have given us purpose, dignity and steady paychecks that help us pay rent, buy groceries and care for our loved ones.
Now all of that is a risk. We’re facing the devastating possibility of losing everything within days.
A union grievance filed by the Service Employees International Union Local 1000 led to the state Personnel Board deciding that our custodial roles should be changed to state civil service positions, meaning the jobs would be held by state employees.
But since no one has stepped up to fill the jobs, the state now appears to be moving toward reassigning our duties to inmates in the prison industry program, replacing PRIDE Industries workers who have done these jobs reliably and effectively for years.  
We believe in rehabilitation programs, and many of us have our own second-chance stories. 
But it shouldn’t come at the expense of a dedicated workforce made up largely of people with disabilities and service-disabled veterans like me. There is enough work at the California Medical Facility for everyone.
This month, 80 PRIDE Industries workers rallied at the Capitol. We met with key legislators and hand-delivered a letter to SEIU Local 1000’s president, pleading for one thing — to sit down with us and the state to find a solution. 
We believe in SEIU’s mission, that every worker deserves dignity, respect and a fair voice. And we’ve said we’d join the union. 
We are not asking for charity. We have earned our place and have a stellar record of helping the California Medical Facility remain clean, safe and licensed for patient care, even during the toughest stretches of the COVID-19 crisis.
The workers who fill jobs like these tell the story best. Ronika Washington is a mother of five who is assistant operations manager at PRIDE Industries. She needs this job. “This job gives me peace of mind, knowing I can provide for my children without relying on the system.”

And Chris Fuqua, a disabled veteran who is assistant operations manager at PRIDE Industries, eis dismayed this is even happening.  “After 10 years … it’s shocking to me and everyone that the state wouldn’t come through as they have done in the past.”
I feel this deeply, too. After serving in the Air Force as a crew chief on C-5 aircraft, I remained in California and spent years battling anxiety and bipolar disorder. My diagnoses are still part of my life, but working for PRIDE Industries has made navigating the workplace far easier. I’m proud of the work we do at the California Medical Facility.
But our contract ends on June 30, and there is no safety net for most of us. Losing this job means losing our income, health insurance and the supportive workplace that makes it possible for us to succeed and stay healthy. 
We ask that SEIU Local 1000 meet with us, and that Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders extend our contract and support Assemblymember Lori Wilson’s bill, AB 912, which would build a civil service pathway for people with disabilities in the future.
But in the meantime, don’t allow us to lose everything on June 30, while we wait. This moment is a test of the state’s commitment to equity. It’s not enough to say inclusion matters; we need leaders to act like it does. And fast.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/062018-Justice-California-Corrections-Facility_2018_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C699&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 09:03:46.681156

Combat shooting experience required,Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/pge-hiring-executive-bodyguards/,"PG&E has twice hired executive protection staff in the last three months, raising questions about the threats it faces.","In summary
PG&E has twice hired executive protection staff in the last three months, raising questions about the threats it faces.


For the second time in three months, a little-known team within Pacific Gas & Electric has hired someone to watch the CEO’s back. Responsibilities include proactively monitoring for threats, helping executives map out business and personal travel, coordinating with law enforcement and around-the-clock availability for executives and their families. Must have a concealed carry permit or equivalent and combat shooting expertise. 
The job – called “executive protection officer” – is part of the company’s “executive protection department,” a subset of its internal security arm dedicated to protecting PG&E’s CEO and other prominent company leaders. The utility said it has always offered such security and declined to answer questions — such as how much it spends on bodyguards and whether ratepayers are on the hook for their cost. 
California’s next largest utility company, Southern California Edison, also acknowledged to CalMatters that it provides executive security. Experts say their use of executive bodyguards raises questions about what sorts of threats they are receiving, how they are addressing the underlying controversies and how they are handling the expenses.
PG&E’s job listings come on the heels of rising interest in security for executives after the CEO of insurance behemoth UnitedHealthcare was fatally shot in Manhattan in December. And there are signs public sentiment toward PG&E has turned more negative in recent years. The utility’s customers saw several rate increases last year alone, ratcheting up bills that are already among the highest in the nation. At public meetings for approving such rate hikes, unhappy ratepayers regularly rail against the company and admonish utility regulators. And PG&E’s equipment was associated with several fires in recent years, including the Camp Fire, in which the company pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the 84 victims of the fire.
PG&E appears to work with multi-national security firm Allied Universal for some of its security needs. Allied has said it protects 80% of Fortune 500 companies.
“I know that some in California have been blamed for some of the wildfires,” Allied Universal’s president of enhanced protection services Glen Kucera said in an interview. “We work with some of those companies now to identify [threats] and put together an executive protection platform to protect those key assets when they’re traveling anywhere.”
UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s death kicked off a wave of concern among corporate executives that they could be targeted as a result of their business. Kucera said Allied received as many inquiries in the first quarter of this year as it did in the past five years combined. 
The common thread among companies seeking protection for their leaders, he said, is that they do or produce something that could be controversial. That includes major utilities around the country.
Kucera said that non-disclosure agreements prevent him from naming specific clients. Allied Universal’s website, however, currently lists an available position for a security patrol driver for PG&E. 
“We have always provided security for our executives so this is nothing new, and is a common practice industry-wide,” Jason King, spokesperson for PG&E, said in an email.
Protecting executives isn’t just about their personal safety, Kucera said. It’s also about protecting the company’s value. UnitedHealthcare lost about $63 billion in value after its CEO was killed. PG&E’s recent listing notes that its executive protection department “plays a critical role” in not only securing its leadership but “maintaining business continuity.” 
Jeff Monford, spokesperson for Southern California Edison’s parent company Edison International, acknowledged that Southern California Edison provides executive security, paying for it through a “combination of both shareholders and customers.”
Who pays for it makes a difference, said Aneil Kovvali, law professor at Indiana University who studies corporate governance. Shareholders paying for the protection is less of an issue, he said, because they would be taking a cut on their returns to do so, while ratepayers would be footing the bill for an additional item.
Why companies have this protection in the first place also matters, further complicating politics around who pays.
“If there isn’t a specific threat against the CEO and it’s just that you like having people around you to make you feel important, that feels more like a perk,” Kovvali said. “If they’re getting specific death threats or law enforcement is telling you that there’s a problem, that puts you in a different category.”
“Ratepayers shouldn’t be paying one penny for any of it until we can audit.”Kellie Buster, president of advocacy group Stop PG&E
Five of California’s investor-owned utilities, including PG&E, declined to answer questions about whether they have received threats against leadership or about specifics of their executive protection operations. They cited policies about not commenting on security. Bear Valley Electric did not respond to requests for interviews.
Kellie Buster, president of advocacy group Stop PG&E, said that her organization is firmly against violence. Shareholders, she said, should be covering any executive protection.
“Ratepayers shouldn’t be paying one penny for any of it until we can audit and see where all this money is [going],” she said.
It’s also important for utilities to understand the root cause of what they’re protecting against, according to Timothy Pollock, business professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville whose research focuses on corporate governance and reputation. Without this component, utilities could be missing the forest for the trees.
“If they’re that angry with you, you need to look at why,” he said. If security is the main response to negative sentiment toward the company, “I would see it as a bad sign for their reputation. That would tell me they don’t really understand what the issue is.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061015-PGE-Antioch-AW-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 09:03:46.681156

A pilot program by the Los Angeles Community College District pays $1,200 a month to students pursuing health fields. By helping with living expenses, the district hopes the guaranteed income will help more students complete their health care workforce development programs.


In November last year, Los Angeles City College student Brenda Olazava got an email notifying her that she had been selected to participate in a guaranteed income pilot program. She would receive 12 monthly stipends of $1,000 to spend however she wanted.
 “We’ll see if this is true or not,” she thought. 
The pilot program for the Los Angeles Community College District, Building Outstanding Opportunities for Students to Thrive, or BOOST, provides monthly payments for one year to eligible community college students majoring in a health care field. Olazava’s skepticism disappeared when she received her first monthly stipend in time for Thanksgiving 2024.
Throughout California, dozens of guaranteed income programs provide participants with monthly stipends. But only a few reach college students. Even fewer reach community college students. 
In Santa Clara, a pilot program provides a $1,200 monthly stipend for two years to unhoused students between the ages of 16 and 20. In another pilot program, some former foster youth, formerly incarcerated people and CalWorks recipients at 10 California community colleges started receiving monthly guaranteed income in March 2024 through Hire UP. 
BOOST is unique because it specifically targets health care students as part of an effort to address California’s chronic nursing shortage. California community colleges offer academic pathways to jobs in health care, but many of the nursing programs in the Los Angeles Community College District have some of the highest attrition rates in the state. The program also provides students stipends during the critical period after they complete their degrees and transition into employment.
Guaranteed income helps student focus on psychology program
Though Olazava was skeptical when she heard about the program, she figured, “Why not apply?” 
The money has made a difference. Olazava now pays her bills on time, takes her kids out to eat and buys her son the clothes and shoes he needs. She has more time to study, has As in her courses and is on the honor roll.
Olazava found her passion taking care of elderly adults during the pandemic. She was fascinated by how the body and mind function following accidents or as individuals age. But after a work injury in 2021 sidelined her, she realized she needed to find a new career. Her therapist suggested going back to school.
Olazava signed up for a psychology class at Los Angeles City College, even though the semester had already started. She loved the class and decided to keep going. She signed up for a full course load and took classes in sociology, psychology and humanities. 
A decade earlier, Olazava had earned her associate degree in criminal justice as a single parent to an infant and a toddler. Now she returned to school full time as a single parent to two teenagers. 
She worked on campus as a student employee and drove for Uber Eats or Lyft at night. She was managing, but it was a struggle. 
“Just being a single mom, it’s just overwhelming financial needs all the time,” she said.
Since her first payment in November, Olazava has saved some money for when she transfers to Cal State Los Angeles in the fall. The extra $1,000 a month gives her more time to study and be with her kids. She has less financial stress and can splurge on ice cream for her kids or a late-night snack.

She graduated on June 10 with four associate degrees in psychology, sociology, social and behavioral science and liberal arts. She will transfer to Cal State Los Angeles to study psychology and plans to pursue a master’s degree in social work.
When Olazava started college for a second time at age 37, her kids were skeptical that she’d persevere. 
“But I always told my kids, it doesn’t matter how old you are, as long as you want to do something, go ahead and do it,” she said.
Guaranteed income recipients plan to enter health fields
The pilot includes 251 students at East Los Angeles College, Los Angeles Southwest College, Los Angeles City College, and Los Angeles Trade-Tech College in the Los Angeles Community College District, which serves about 250,000 students. 
About half the students in the community college district report incomes at or below poverty level, according to Kelly King, chief advancement officer for the Los Angeles Community College District and executive director of the district’s foundation, which manages the BOOST program. The monthly stipend is not tied to enrolled units or grades and students choose how they spend the money, whether on diapers, groceries, car repairs or to pay down debt. 
While few guaranteed income programs target community college students, the need is there. More than two-thirds of nearly 67,000 California community college students surveyed struggle to meet their basic needs, according to the 2023 RealCollege Survey. 
BOOST’s program is studying two groups: the 251 health care and psychology students who receive the monthly income, and a control group of 370 who don’t receive the stipend.

The monthly amount is not intended to fully cover the high living costs in L.A. County, but to help participants ease financial stressors. 
Participants in other community guaranteed income studies who received a $1,000 monthly stipend reported lower stress levels, fewer skipped meals, and the ability to plan ahead, lower their debt, or upgrade their housing, King said.
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania cite one other guaranteed income pilot program for community college students in Santa Fe. They found that giving students $400 a month for one year led to positive outcomes. At the end of the pilot program, more recipients were employed, felt they could weather a $400 emergency, spent more time with their children, and were able to save more. Most of the participants said the money went to running the household and buying food, according to the report. 
Higher education researchers and policy makers often assess the value of guaranteed income in terms of progress toward economic mobility. But the Santa Fe study revealed more intangible benefits. 
Participants described pursuing higher education for reasons distinct from job training, said Amy Castro, lead researcher on the BOOST study. “These students were saying, ‘I am pursuing higher education to be somebody who has a degree, and I want to learn because it has value for me and dignity to me, and it’s the way that I want to honor my family,’” she said.
Decoupling the guaranteed basic income from academic requirements allows researchers to continue to observe effects of guaranteed income on community college students through periods when they may not be enrolled due to life events, scheduling challenges or academic recesses. “[This] provides a really fascinating window into the actual lives and progression of our students,” King said.

The BOOST pilot provides researchers a first-of-its-kind, randomized, controlled trial in higher education at this scale, said King. Because the participants share a common goal – employment in a health field – researchers can study the impact of guaranteed income on progress toward a specific outcome. 
Costs of attendance for community college students can exceed costs for the University of California or California State University, especially in high cost of living regions like L.A. County, King said. California community college students receive less state aid than UC and Cal State students. And across the state, the costs of college have risen exponentially over the last three decades.
Private donors provided the nearly $4 million needed to run the pilot program. The Broad Foundation gave nearly $3.2 million and the L.A. Community College Foundation contributed nearly $870,000 from its Young Adults Forward Fund.
Initial BOOST success guides disaster relief grants in LA
Informed by the research on and success of guaranteed income pilot programs, the Los Angeles Community College Foundation will offer ongoing financial payments to a small group of students who lost housing for a long period of time or experienced significant hardship due to the January 2025 wildfires. 
The hope is to help students recover from the losses incurred by the wildfires and to continue on their educational path. The grants provide $1,000 a month for 12 months to 24 eligible students. The foundation raised more than $3 million in private donations for disaster relief, which will fund the monthly payments to Los Angeles students as well as go to disaster relief programs at Glendale and Pasadena community colleges, according to King. 
The BOOST pilot program brings together strategies to help students stay on track with their studies and a year of guaranteed monthly income. King said the foundation applied this formula to long-term disaster funding, to ask how disaster response grants could accomplish two types of goals: supporting students in their education through the disaster and making sure their future educational or career training goals weren’t disrupted. 
Next, King plans to create a guide for other colleges to start similar programs. She also aims to secure funds for future pilot guaranteed income programs for health care students, as well as for students raising children while attending community college.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052625_Guaranteed-Income-Pilot_SK_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-23 09:03:46.681156

Martin Heinrich (D-NM) speaks with health care providers, hospital advocates and patients on Friday, June 20, 2025 about the impact of potential Republican-backed Medicaid cuts in the current spending bill moving through U.S. Congress. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM) Six to eight hospitals in New Mexico may be at risk of closing within 18 months if Congressional Republicans follow through with pursuing Medicaid cuts in the “big, beautiful bill,” advocates and hospital executives said Friday.
Hospital closures in rural areas would further burden doctors in urban areas and force higher wait times and costs for patients, according to Troy Clark, the CEO for the New Mexico Hospital Association, which represents all 47 of the state’s hospitals.
MLG joins other Dem governors to decry proposed Medicaid cuts in nation’s most-reliant state

“If we lose providers in Las Cruces, Santa Fe will feel the effect. Just like a spider web, no matter where you touch it, the whole thing is going to shake,” Clark said.
Clark spoke as one of the guests at a roundtable hosted by the U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) with Medicaid users, practitioners and medical industry representatives from Albuquerque and surrounding areas about the potential impacts to Medicaid on New Mexico.
Per capita, New Mexicans rely on Medicaid, the joint federal and state program to help cover medical costs for some people with lower incomes, at the highest rate in the country. There are more than 830,000 New Mexicans enrolled, about 40% of the state, and just under half of those patients are children.
Medicaid reimburses school nurses for student care, said Cheri Brubaker, who oversees 135 nurses at Albuquerque Public Schools.
“We would lose over 50% of our nurses if the district was unable to pick up the cost,” Brubaker said. “If you’ve got children that have asthma and only occasionally need support, it’s still significant, because relying on people that are not trained to take care of these conditions, can create more emergencies.”
The current version of the spending bill would strip Medicaid coverage from nearly 11 million people by 2030, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, although some could find alternative coverage. That would mean losses of coverage for at least 96,000 New Mexicans and nearly $11 billion in lost federal funds. The loss of insurance would strain emergency rooms and raise the costs for care overall, Heinrich said.
“That is the heart of why I have been so opposed to this bill,” he said. “You couldn’t design a budget reconciliation package that would be worse for the state of New Mexico than what we’re going to vote on.”
Medicaid cuts would worsen both primary and emergency systems and require “tough decisions” for hospital services moving forward, said Dr. Vesta Sandoval, chief medical officer at Lovelace Health Systems.
“It is really a domino effect, statewide,” Sandoval said. “It is going to affect every aspect of care, whether it’s schools, whether it’s clinics, or the hospitals.”
Senate Republicans leadership promised a vote before July 4, even as members of the party worry cuts will shutter rural hospitals across the country.
Heinrich said he was in talks with Republican counterparts in Western states to convince them of the potential consequences.
“How about we don’t close them in the first place?” Heinrich said Friday about hospitals. “I think that’s the best solution; it’s always easier to improve on what you have than rebuild from scratch.”
Medicaid makes up nearly 30% of many hospitals’ income in New Mexico, according to a March memo from the New Mexico Health Care Authority. Without the federal portion, hospitals could cut further services or close completely.
Clark told Source NM after the roundtable that he would not name which hospitals face the biggest threat of closing or the areas in which they operate, in order to prevent “panic,” but said that all hospitals across NM face losses with Medicaid cuts.
“The reality is they’re all at risk, since we have so much Medicaid here,” he said. “Are they at risk of closure, I don’t think so. But they are at risk of restricting services that impact everyone.”
New Mexico state lawmakers will hear presentations in the coming week on further concerns over Medicaid cuts.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heinrich-2-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 09:03:46.681156

(Courtesy of the Utah Governor's Office)The Utah Senate has voted to confirm Gov. Spencer Cox’s appointment of Lonny Pehrson to be the first-ever director of the state’s newly created Government Records Office. 
The Senate on Wednesday, during an extraordinary session to consider several judicial and executive branch nominations, voted 18-8 to approve Pehrson’s appointment. Democrats, without debate, voted against. 
The vote came after Pehrson’s appointment was favorably recommended earlier this month by the Senate Government Operations Confirmation Committee after an hourlong hearing, with some airing concerns over whether Pehrson will be an unbiased and transparent records czar. 
Utah lawmakers look to dissolve, replace State Records Committee. Here’s why that matters

The new office he’ll be heading has also been a focus of controversy. The Utah Legislature earlier this year created it to replace the 30-year-old, seven-member State Records Committee, which previously decided disputes over public records. 
Lawmakers argued the new office would cut down on wait times for records decisions, be more efficient, and replace the State Records Committee with someone with more legal expertise. Critics, including media professionals, argued the move would consolidate too much power with one person and lead to less transparency. 
The Society of Professional Journalists awarded the Utah Legislature its annual Black Hole award for the passage SB277, which created the new office, along with another bill, HB69, which made it difficult for people who challenge the government over public records denials to recoup their attorney fees. 
Pehrson, who has worked as records counsel for the Utah Attorney General’s Office since 2016, told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing that in his new role, his focus will be on ensuring government entities are following Utah’s open records law when it comes to which records do or don’t get released to the public. 
His supporters applauded him as a professional with deep expertise in Utah’s open records laws. Critics, including Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Salt Lake City, opposed Pehrson’s appointment during the hearing. While Blouin acknowledged Pehrson is clearly qualified for the position, he said he has “frustrations and concerns” over the “optics” of selecting someone from the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which under former Attorney General Sean Reyes faced criticism for a lack of transparency. 
Pehrson, in his previous role as records counsel for Reyes, argued against releasing Reyes’ work calendar in response to requests from local news outlets KSL and The Salt Lake Tribune. 
In the dispute over those records, the State Records Committee ultimately sided with reporters, and in February a judge ruled that Reyes’ official calendar should be released. But the same day as the judge’s ruling, the Utah Legislature passed a bill to allow elected officials and government employees the ability to keep their calendars — including work meetings — private moving forward. 
Will new records director represent Utahns or the government? Cox’s nominee advances

Reyes didn’t seek reelection last year after concerns surfaced over his past relationship with  the embattled anti-trafficking nonprofit Operation Underground Railroad and its founder, Tim Ballard. Earlier this year, a legislative audit of Reyes’ administration concluded that “insufficient transparency” resulted in “a lack of accountability for the position of the attorney general.” 
Pehrson, in his comments in front of the committee, addressed those concerns. 
“I recognize and appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about my experience with the Attorney General’s Office and whether it might hamper my ability to faithfully carry out this new role,” Pehrson said. “While understandable, I believe these concerns to be unfounded.” 
As assistant attorney general, Pehrson said he had an “ethical obligation to selflessly represent my client to the best of my ability.” 
“I have always tried to do this, regardless of whether I agreed personally with the position taken or not,” Pehrson added. “However, having also worked extensively in a judicial setting, I understand very well the difference between representing a client and acting as a neutral arbiter of disputes.” 
Thus, Pehrson said he didn’t believe his time in the Attorney General’s Office “would in any way compromise my ability to lead the Government Records Office or to fairly and impartially decide records disputes that might come before me.”

Alabama ranks 43rd in overall child well-being, according to the data. That ranking is determined by four sub groups: economic well-being, education, health, and family and community. Alabama declined in all four indicators. 
Apriell Hartsfield, executive director of Voices for Alabama Children, said in an interview Wednesday that it is important to look at how the state has improved or regressed independently, rather than how the state ranks nationally.
“There’s two different stories there. One is looking at the ranking, how we compare to other states,” Hartsfield said. “The other story is the one that we try to focus on more. That’s how we compare against ourselves from year to year.”

The state-level KidsCount data was released in February and showed an improvement overall. The state data book has more indicators than the 16 in the national book.
Health
The state’s largest fall compared with last year was in the health category, from 39th to 44th. The indicators for the category are low birth-weight babies, children without health insurance, child and teen deaths, and children and teens who are overweight or obese. The data for the health category is from 2023. 
Dr. Wes Stubblefield, district health officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health, said in an interview Wednesday that data like KidsCount informs public health policy.
“This is something that we need to make sure that we’re keeping an eye on when it comes to children and their health, their ongoing health, their education, and getting the best start as possible,” Stubblefield said.
The state improved from 2019 to 2023 in one area of the health category. According to the KidsCount data, 10.4% of babies born in Alabama in 2023 were underweight, which is down 0.1% from 2019 and 2% higher than the national average. Stubblefield said there are many factors in low birth weight, including chronic health issues in mothers, which he said need to be managed before and during pregnancy.
“Sometimes these individuals may not be covered by Medicaid,” he said. “Programs to treat moms with chronic health conditions, either before they get pregnant or during pregnancy, is very important.”
Making sure people with chronic conditions get in to see their obstetricians and ensuring they’re not on medications that affect the health of the fetus are also key, he said.
Four percent of Alabama children did not have health insurance in 2023, according to the research, and that’s one point more than the year before. Stubblefield said that data point is historically low because of a program called All Kids funded through the state and federal government for children who are above the threshold for Medicaid but still can’t afford private health insurance.
“We’re better than the national average, although it did go up. I’m not exactly sure what contributed to that,” he said.
Hartsfield said the end of a pandemic-era policy that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid beneficiaries was one factor. That resulted in about 370,000 Alabamians losing Medicaid coverage. Although the number of children that lost Medicaid coverage in 2023 is not available, those who did likely qualified for All Kids coverage.
“There just weren’t the resources there to provide for children, or there was some kind of administrative barrier, as far as the unwinding process,” she said.
Education
The second largest decline in the rankings was in education, from 34th to 38th. The indicators for the category are young children not in school (data from 2019-2023), fourth graders not proficient in reading (2024), eighth graders not proficient in math (2024), and high school students not graduating on time (data from 2021-2022). 
The KidsCount data showed that 82% of eighth graders were not proficient in math, which is 3% more than the 2019 data. Hartsfield said the regression and general lack of proficiency is likely due to the cohort of eighth graders missing the classroom instruction of foundational math during the pandemic.
Hartsfield said the recent gains in education, like the improved National Assessment of Educational Progress and Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress scores, are directly related to the Numeracy and Literacy acts of 2022 and 2019, respectively. 
Still, according to the KidsCount data, 72% of fourth graders are not proficient in reading, which is consistent with data from the NAEP scores released in January. The state did not improve or regress in this category.
Those rankings may improve next year, Hartsfield said. Scores released by the Alabama State Department of Education last week showed that third-grade reading proficiency has improved, despite an increased cutoff score.
“I do anticipate that it will show some improvements in the kids count data next summer, hopefully,” Hartsfield said.
Preschool is not required in the United States, and the research shows 57% of young children in Alabama are not in school. Hartsfield said the state’s First Class Pre-K program has helped get 4-year-olds in school, and the federally funded Head Start program has helped prepare 3-year-olds.
She said that the pre-K program often has waiting lists. If a family is able to travel to a different location without a waiting list, she recommended they do it. 
“Don’t let your child miss the program if you are able to get them down the road a little bit, in the next community over,” she said.
Economy
The state lost one rank in economic well-being over the year from 35th to 36th. The state did not see a shift in the number of children in poverty, and Hartsfield said there is a much bigger picture to look at.
“More than 1 in 5 children in Alabama live in poverty,” she said. “As I’ve said before, poverty does not define a child. However, the challenges that children in poverty face can have lifelong, really harsh effects.”
Family and community
Although Alabama’s rank did not change in the family and community category, the state improved in all four indicators within the category.
“In the family and community domain, I really feel like the investments that we’ve made in the education domain, especially in pre-K through 12, there’s tangible evidence of those policies and those investments that we’ve made in those policies working,” Hartsfield said. 
Most of the improvements were minor, but the largest was the number of teen births per 1,000 teens, falling from 26 to 20, according to the data. Children living in high-poverty areas also fell, 15% to 11%.
“While progress is uneven, the direction is clear. We know what kids need to grow up healthy and connected: stable homes, strong schools, nutritious food, meaningful relationships and opportunities to learn, play and grow,” Lisa Lawson, KidsCount executive director and president, wrote in the data book’s foreword. “This moment calls for focus, creativity and commitment. It calls on leaders at every level to act boldly where improvement is needed and rely on what we know works.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2828-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

She had good reason. Her public education ended at age 14. At the time, public high schools did not exist in Ireland. The fifth child of a Irish farmer’s 10 children could only get a secondary education with a scholarship to a private school. And she did not get that.

She didn’t want that life. So she left. So did most of her sisters.
And decades later, she’s still angry.

“It wasn’t right,” she recently told me at our kitchen table. “Can you imagine doing that at age 17? It wasn’t right.”
I can’t imagine my oldest daughter, now 17, crossing an ocean by herself. My wife and I don’t feel comfortable letting her venture 50 miles from home.
When you make that kind of journey, it’s the only choice you have left.
The discussion of immigration on the federal and state level ignores that fact.
The Trump administration treats immigrants as commodities, pushing them around and locking them up. It sets arrest quotas for those without legal status. The president plans to use raids to punish political enemies.
Here in Alabama, we’ve made it difficult to drive people without status around. And we have a new statute requiring law enforcement to collect the DNA of immigrants without legal status in custody. They don’t have to face criminal charges. They just have to get caught in a system that makes it next-to-impossible for anyone without a major degree or a large wad of cash to come to this country legally.
And we have local sheriffs and police chiefs eagerly signing up to throw these men and women in jail.
You don’t pass those sorts of laws unless you assume that anyone from a foreign country is a threat. In this view, immigrants are opportunists, eager to leech off the greatness of the United States of America or the aspirational mediocrity of Alabama.
So we dehumanize people. And we look past the pain they carry. But you’ll never understand immigration without seeing those wounds.
It’s hard to leave everything behind, even when everything you leave is screwed up. Many people will stick with the misery of the familiar rather than set foot into the unknown.
When you do, it’s because you can’t do anything else. Building a new life in a new country — finding housing and work, or learning a new language — strains the body and taxes the mind. It can wring a person out.
Now imagine doing that in a country where the benefits of immigration are ignored; where a man who deals in paranoid caricatures dictates immigration policy and where people have to fear those charged with upholding the law. My mother dealt with a lot as an immigrant, but threats from law enforcement were not in the mix.
What does it say that people still come to the United States in the face of that harassment?
Many would say it shows our inherent greatness. All the people trudging through Ellis Island in those black-and-white newsreels, it’s thought, came out smiling; ate meat three times a day and found jobs that gave their children a springboard to a better life and their grandchildren the chance to find homes in the suburbs.
Even the most rabid nativist thinks the huddled masses at our borders validates American exceptionalism.
But let me suggest that immigration is less a reflection of our shining virtues than of the desperation of the immigrant.
It’s less about us than what awaits them at home. If you will endure the struggles of building a new life and risk the chance of legal harassment here, it’s because the alternative is worse.
This hardly factors in discussions of immigration, even from defenders. We tell or tolerate egregious lies about suffering human beings, casting them as criminals or sponges, blinded by a belief in some American charisma foreigners can’t resist.
But there is no divine light drawing immigrants to our shores. They are borne here by heartbreak. The heartbreak of a birthplace that cannot be a home. The agony of choosing between likely suffering in one place and guaranteed suffering in another.
A kinder country might re-center the discussion of immigration on that pain. It could even lead to a more humane and logical policy, one that understands that the poor and the desperate, not the wealthy and educated, are most likely to immigrate.

BESSEMER — When a representative for a hotly contested development began to speak inside City Hall here Tuesday evening, the lights went out.
A packed room of zoning commissioners and upset residents groaned, already on edge from the issue at hand: consideration of a proposal to construct a massive data center in a rural Birmingham suburb. Only a few moments passed before the power was restored and the meeting proceeded, but a day after the meeting’s conclusion, residents said they feel like they’re still sitting in the dark.
Despite universal opposition by the dozens of residents present at the meeting, commissioners voted to recommend changes to the city’s zoning laws to allow data centers in areas zoned for light industrial use and to rezone a 700-acre property from agricultural to light industrial to accommodate the construction of a hyperscale data center.
Now, one of the largest proposed data centers in the country is one step closer to construction.
“This was only a damn formality,” resident Ron Morgan yelled out after the measures passed. “Y’all have already made up your minds.”

At full buildout, the proposed data center would lead to clear-cutting of more than 100 acres of forested land and have 18 server-farm buildings that would each be larger than the average Walmart Supercenter. Projections suggest the site would consume 10 times the energy used by all residences in nearby Birmingham and more than five times the entire state’s residential consumption of water.
Scientists have also said that the project’s construction and operation could put a newly discovered fish species—the Birmingham darter—at risk of extinction because of its potential impact on waterways.
“This would nuke this creek,” Thomas Near, a Yale University biologist, has said of the project.
Resident after resident, each limited to three minutes, made their way to the podium in the packed chamber inside Bessemer City Hall on Tuesday evening to oppose both the zoning law change and the development plan itself. Only a representative of the developer, Logistic Land Investments LLC, and its law firm, Evans & Evans, spoke in favor of the plan, arguing that there would be virtually no impacts on residents or the environment.
After the meeting, the development representative, Brad Kaaber, initially refused to spell his name for a reporter.
“I’d really rather you not use my name at all,” Kaaber said, though he soon relented.
The planning and zoning commission’s recommended approval will now be sent to Bessemer City Council, which will ultimately decide the fate of the $14.5 billion project.
A Meeting Revisited
Tuesday’s meeting wasn’t the first time the planning and zoning commission had considered zoning changes related to the proposed data center.
In March, the body met to consider the same items and recommended approval to the City Council.
After that decision, however, a group of impacted residents filed suit over the process, arguing that Bessemer officials had not provided adequate public notice of the meeting. As a result, a Birmingham judge ordered a temporary restraining order preventing Bessemer City Council from considering the matter until a hearing was held.

Following a hearing in Bessemer, another judge, David Hobdy, said that he would allow the process to move forward if the city was willing to start again. Shan Paden, a lawyer for the city, said that while he believed the city had provided adequate public notice, officials would restart the process.
Tuesday’s meeting was the result, and residents showed up to express their concerns once again.
Commissioners first considered a request to change the city’s zoning ordinances to allow data centers to be located within sites zoned for light industrial use.
Under current law, light industrial uses include bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
The decision before commissioners, then, was whether to rewrite that zoning law to allow data centers.
Residents argued that commissioners should vote down the measure because data centers don’t fit the definition of light industrial development and aren’t comparable to facilities that are permitted under that classification.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan, an impacted resident, told commissioners. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.

Data centers present complicated zoning questions because of their unique mix of impacts and resource requirements, according to experts. Some municipalities across the country have addressed this by creating a separate zoning category for the facilities, allowing governments to incorporate regulations tailored to data centers’ needs and impacts.
Bessemer planning and zoning commissioner Alfedo Acoff expressed concern over changing the law to allow data centers in light industrial zones without adding specific guardrails for their construction and operation.
“We’re not voting just for this project,” Acoff said. “So shouldn’t there be something [in the law] that protects the community when another project comes in?”

One resident told commissioners that they should be wary of any developer who requests that a city change its zoning laws to accommodate it.
“Y’all got your own rules, and you want to let them come in and tell you to change your rules,” he said. “That’s a big problem.”
Ultimately, the commission recommended approval of the light industrial definition change by a vote of 7 to 1.
“This Is a Vampire”
The commission’s next item of business considered a request by Logistic Land Investments to rezone a 700-acre parcel of woodland—the proposed data center site—from agricultural use to light industrial use and to approve its development plan.
Again, residents spoke up to oppose the project, arguing that the developers have given them almost no information about the potential impacts of construction and operation. Public officials have confirmed they’ve signed non-disclosure agreements with the developer, preventing discussion about some aspects of the project and cutting residents off from key local sources of information.
A day prior to the meeting, Bessemer police confronted 80-year-old Marshall Killingsworth outside City Hall, forcing him to remove a sign asking Mayor Kenneth Gulley to meet with him about the data center project.

What the public does know about Logistic Land Investments’ proposed data center has come from limited information provided by the developer, permitting applications and other regulatory documents submitted to state and federal entities.
Documents show that the energy and water projected to be consumed by the data center campus are staggering. If built to full capacity, the Bessemer data center campus could consume around 10.5 million megawatt hours of energy per year, based on estimates provided to residents by representatives of the data center development.
That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer annually, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
A recent regulatory filing by county officials estimated that water usage by the facility could amount to 2 billion gallons per day. That’s more than five times the entire state’s daily residential usage, according to government figures.

Residents are also worried about the impacts to creeks, streams and wetlands, not only from the clear-cutting but also from the years of construction.
“This is a vampire that will drain all of our natural resources,” one resident told commissioners. “It is something that is unwanted.”
Near, the Yale biologist, has told Inside Climate News that he believes the newly identified Birmingham darter is “very likely” to be located on the site. The fish, first described in a paper by Near and his research team, has been found in nearby creeks for years, though it’s now been made locally extinct in nearby Five Mile Creek.


Protecting any Birmingham darters present in Little Blue Creek, which winds through the proposed data center site, will be critical to preventing the species’ ultimate extinction. Construction and operation of the proposed data center would leave the Birmingham darter on the brink, Near said. Because it’s only recently been identified as a distinct species, the darter hasn’t yet gone through the process of being listed as an endangered species under U.S. law—a cumbersome process that can last more than a decade.
Kaaber, the developer’s representative, said concerns over environmental impacts were the result of misinformation and appeared to reference an Inside Climate News story on the Birmingham darter.
“So there’s this, again, a lot of misinformation out there about what’s in the water,” Kaaber said. “There was an article, I think it was from yesterday, about a species that is in a stream, not on this site, but nearby. Again, we’re not impacting streams.”
If there were a concern about environmental impacts on the site, Kaaber said, his company would develop elsewhere.
“There are no recognized environmental concerns on the site,” he said.
Kaaber told commissioners that the company had completed various studies, including an environmental assessment, for the location—a detail that seemed to surprise members of the commission.
“Can I see it?” one commissioner asked.
Kaaber said he would provide the commission a copy of the report—a document that has not been made public.
Representatives of the developer have also not revealed who the end user of the data center would be. Kaaber did not disclose a name at Tuesday’s meeting but suggested it would be a Fortune 10 company—a list that includes both Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Among those in opposition to the project at Tuesday’s meeting was Jimmie Stephens, president of the Jefferson County Commission, who told zoning commissioners he was there at the request of his constituents.

Allowing data centers to be zoned in light industrial without protections for nearby residents would be foolish, Stephens said.
“It’s not right,” he told commissioners.
He also expressed concerns about fire protection for those living around the site—residents who already face low water pressure without a water-guzzling data center located nearby.
“If this is indeed coming,” he said, “let’s take time and do it right.”
In an interview after the meeting, Stephens said that he would be inclined to vote against the project were it to come before him as a county commissioner. So far, he said, the county hasn’t been approached about pitching in public money to support the project. That’s good, Stephens said, because the answer would be an easy one.
“No,” he said. “No hesitation there.”
The planning and zoning commission eventually voted to recommend approval of the zoning change for the proposed data site, from agricultural to light industrial, by a vote of 6 to 2. The measure will now head to the City Council for a final vote.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

Since 2022 the Home Feeds Nevada program has allowed food banks to buy millions of pounds in fresh produce, meats, and dairy from Nevada farms and ranches — all paid in full using state and federal funds.
The program has come a long way since its first order and delivery of 600 pounds of tomatoes from Blue Lizard Farm to Three Square food bank in Southern Nevada three years ago. But major cuts in federal funding by the Trump administration, including nearly $4 million for food banks in Nevada, threatened to end the program.
State Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Las Vegas Democrat, quickly amended Senate Bill 233 to include an additional $800,000 in funding for Home Feeds Nevada. The original bill only included a request for a study on how to sustain the program long term.
The bill received bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo this month.
“While it’s not nearly enough compared to what we have invested before, and there’s millions of dollars that have been lost thoroughly, the allocation that we have at least continues the program to some extent versus eliminating it completely,” Doñate said.
Home Feeds Nevada has fueled Nevada’s agricultural sector while feeding low-income families and children across the state, purchasing more than $8 million in agricultural goods from small local farms and ranches since 2022.
Rodney Mehring, the owner of Blue Lizard Farm, which fulfilled the first order under the program, said the program has been transformational for local farms. With a new injection of funding on the horizon he plans to grow tomatoes, beets, carrots, and summer squash for the program.
“We’re glad that the legislature supported our request for funding,” Mehring said. “We feel very lucky.”
He continued:m“Even though there’s a shortage in funding for the state, they felt that it was important to help farmers have more consistent sales and the best part of the program is that it goes to supporting people in need and helping food banks.”
Home Feeds Nevada has given small family-owned producers like Blue Lizard Farm the security to scale-up and expand, even as inflation and supply chain issues have increased overhead costs for producers.
The vast majority of Nevada farms are family-owned, according to the Department of Agriculture, making up about 93% of producers in the state. But that can put Nevada’s agricultural sector at a disadvantage, as small farms often lack access to the federal subsidies and resources that support larger farms.
Part of the limited help small local farms did receive ended when the U.S. Department of Agriculture axed two programs that funded local food purchasing assistance. Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit earlier this month against the agency to restore federal funding.
Mehring said he hopes Nevada gets involved in the Pennsylvania lawsuit to restore the $4 million in funding Nevada was set to receive for local food purchasing assistance before it was clawed back by the Trump administration.
“I just find it to be absolutely cruel that you would cut funds from food banks and food programs that assist needy Americans, it’s just ridiculous. I mean, of all programs to keep on the books, I think that would be at the top of the list,” Mehring said.
Food bank operators in Nevada said they were grateful to Lombardo for signing the bill. Home Feeds Nevada gives food banks the ability to tap into locally sourced agricultural goods they can’t get elsewhere, including fresh produce, high quality meats, and dairy. 
“No question that this was a session where budgets were tight. In a really difficult budget year, I’m just really happy that this was on the list of priorities, and that the legislature and the governor were able to find funding for it,” said Beth Martino, the CEO of Three Square. 
Since Home Feeds Nevada launched, Three Square has purchased nearly 2 million pounds of fresh produce and protein from Nevada farmers and producers, said Martino. 
Demand at food banks is only growing, she added. Food insecurity in Southern Nevada has surged nearly 40% since 2023, and recent federal funding cuts have made it incredibly difficult for Three Square to meet the growing need.
In Southern Nevada—1 in 6 people—are food insecure, according to findings from Feeding America’s 2025 Map the Meal Gap study.
“We are seeing a classic supply and demand problem. Between cuts at the federal level and increased demand we are starting to see some shortages in what we have available. We have less food on the shelves now than we need to meet the demand that is in our community,” Martino said.
“Every pound of food that comes in the door is important to us at this point,” she continued. 
Shane Piccinini, the director of government relations for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, said that same demand is reflected in northern Nevada. The Food Bank of Northern Nevada is currently serving about 160,000 people every single month, a 28% increase since 2022.
Piccinini said as other nutrition and welfare programs are cut by the Trump administration under the reconciliation bill Nevada will be an increase in food insecurity. Nevada will have to take on more of that burden, including funding Home Feeds Nevada, Piccinini said.
“As of right now, the money the legislature appropriated to Home Feeds Nevada is all there is,” Piccinini said. “We definitely want to see dedicated funding to this program, which the other half of this bill sets up a committee to do exactly that, to identify a funding source that would be dedicated to Home Feeds Nevada.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Produce-on-Wheels-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

Here's what to know.,"Connecticut lawmakers passed legislation this session that overhauls portions of the state’s consumer protection laws by adding additional safeguards for people purchasing a wide variety of goods and services.
The 33-page bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Ned Lamont earlier this month, was one of the top priorities for Senate Democrats this year, and it includes some far-reaching changes. 
It widens the state Attorney General Office’s ability to police price gouging, mandates that businesses disclose so-called junk fees, requires companies producing internet-connected devices to inform people if their technology captures and shares audio or video from homes and more.
Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, helped shepherd the bill, S.B. 3, through the legislature and said it would help to protect Connecticut residents in a changing consumer landscape.
“Connecticut is stepping up to protect families from predatory business practices, whether it’s microphones in household appliances, recording their conversations or surprise junk fees inflating their bills,” Maroney, co-chair of the legislature’s General Law Committee, said. 
Here is what the bill will and won’t do.
Price gouging
Connecticut already had a law on the books that allowed the state’s attorney general to police and prosecute cases of price gouging, or artificially jacking up the price on goods during emergencies, like natural disasters.
S.B. 3 expands the attorney general’s oversight beyond retailers, like supermarkets and gas stations. Now, the AG’s office can also investigate and charge distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and wholesalers for charging “unconscionably excessive” prices.
The law also expanded that oversight to rental and leasing agreements.
Automatic renewals
Have you ever signed up for a service and forgot that you were paying for it? Well, the Connecticut legislature wants to make sure you get a reminder.
Part of the new consumer protection law requires some companies that have “automatic renewals” or “continuous service provisions” to send consumers an annual notice that they will continue to be charged for the service. 
The law also mandates that the companies alert consumers how they can cancel that recurring contract via a website, phone or email. 
That segment of the bill does not apply to every company, however. Lawmakers specifically provided exemptions to that rule for gas, water and electric utilities and internet service providers. They also provided similar exemptions to banks and insurance companies. 
All of those are already regulated by separate state and federal entities.
But lawmakers also exempted what they referred to as “global or national services” that predominantly provide “audiovisual content,”  which would seem to include online streaming services.
Total price disclosure
Another section of the new law deals with hidden fees, or junk fees as they are sometimes called. 
Lawmakers crafted language that prohibits businesses from “advertising, displaying, or offering” a good or service at a price that does not incorporate all of the “fees, charges and costs” that consumers will be required to pay.
If such fees are not “advertised or displayed,” or if the charges are “intentionally obscured, unclear or misrepresented,” companies can be sued under Connecticut’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.
That type of requirement also applies to rental properties. The bill generally states that a landlord must include any periodic “fee, charge, or cost” that a tenant must pay when advertising a dwelling unit for rent.
Just like the automatic renewals, however, there are exceptions to the fee disclosures. 
Companies don’t need to list federal, state or local taxes that are added onto a purchase price. The law also does not apply in situations where a business “cannot feasibly” calculate what something, like shipping, will cost during the time of the purchase. 
Internet connected devices 
Connecticut lawmakers also waded into a relatively new consumer issue: devices that can record people in their own homes.  
The Democratic-controlled legislature is seeking to prevent companies that sell internet-connected appliances, televisions, or toys from recording unwitting consumers and then using that information for their own purposes.
The new law specifies that companies selling such products must inform people when their device can transmit audio or video back to the manufacturer or a third party. The devices must also give consumers the option of deactivating such features, unless that action would render the device useless.
Lawmakers also added a section to the bill that prohibits internet-connected devices from including built-in features that allow law enforcement agencies to monitor people’s communications. 
And it prohibits companies from using the devices to collect information that can help other businesses identify the user for targeted advertising. 
Maroney referred to those sections as the bill’s “eavesdropping provisions.” 
Right to repair 
One of the most ambitious sections of the law deals with what is known as right to repair, which seeks to ensure that consumers have access to all of the materials needed to repair their own products. 
More than half a dozen other states have already passed similar provisions into law.  
Connecticut’s version mandates that the manufacturers of electronics or appliances make resources available to allow consumers to “diagnose, maintain, or repair their products.”
The bill specifies that those resources should include “documentation, parts and tools,” and it will apply to products “manufactured, sold or used” in Connecticut after July 1, 2026. 
The manufacturers will be required to make that documentation and those parts and tools available for three or five years, depending on how much the product costs.
But companies don’t need to turn over anything that would be considered a trade secret or intellectual property and the bill doesn’t apply to products that are no longer being manufactured.
Still, there is a long list of items that won’t be covered, including boats, all-terrain vehicles, generators, power tools, electric vehicle charging stations, lawn equipment, construction equipment, farm equipment, forestry equipment, mining equipment and engines.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_8928.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

I spend my days out at our field site in the beautiful Sierra Nevada, following and recording chickadees as they communicate with each other. I have taken numerous focal recordings, where I stand in the forest with a directional microphone, identifying vocalizations and behaviors in real time.
I also have hundreds of hours of recordings taken by automated recording devices called AudioMoths. These allow me to record vocalizations in the absence of people.
The extensive vocal repertoire of mountain chickadees has yet to be fully documented. There are five basic categories of call types:

Contact calls: communicate identity, sort of like a name, and location.
“Chick-a-dee” calls: coordinate flock movement and communicate a variety of complex information about the environment, from food availability to predator presence and type.
Alarm calls: alert others of the presence of a predator.
Begging calls: used by chicks or females to elicit feeding behavior from males.
Gargle calls: advertise dominance over other individuals in a flock, primarily used by males.

“Chick-a-dee” calls contain several elements resembling the basic elements of human grammar. Essentially, the various sounds a chickadee utters mean different things, similar to words in human languages. And the way that a chickadee combines these sounds changes the meaning. Word order matters, just like grammar matters in human language. If a chickadee were to phrase its calls in the wrong note order, the call would no longer convey the same meaning, even if composed of the same elements.
The “chick-a-dee” call of the mountain chickadee contains six elements, known as notes or syllables, that can be combined in hundreds of unique combinations to say many different things. These elements are labeled A, A/B, B, C, D and Dh.
Although scientists don’t fully know the meaning of each note in different contexts, it is generally believed that A notes typically contain identifying information about how important the topic seems to the caller, while A/B and B notes tend to further inform the listener of the topic of conversation. C notes contain information about the subject of the call, often a food source, and D notes convey information about the excitement and urgency of the message, including level of threat of a spotted predator or size of a food source. The D notes basically function like exclamation points at the end of a sentence, while the other notes convey more specific information.
Mountain chickadees can use their “chick-a-dee” calls to convey hundreds of different phrases that are relevant to navigating their habitats and social environments. As a hypothetical example, a mountain chickadee call might have the following syntax: A-A-A/B-B-D-D, which could roughly translate to something like, “Listen to me carefully (A-A): there is a predator (A/B) close by (B) and a medium threat level (DD).”
If the note order switched to D-A-B-D-A/B-A, the sentence would look more like: “Noteworthy listen close by noteworthy predator listen to me.” Although all the same elements are there, this sentence is now much more difficult to comprehend. Notes that are out of order can confuse chickadees, preventing them from grasping the correct meaning of the call.
This “translation” is an example based on what we have learned from playback experiments, but the exact meaning will depend on the specific population and surrounding environment.
 Analyzing the ‘chick-a-dee’ calls

Back in the lab, I parse through the endless hours of recordings using a deep-learning algorithm that I have modified to identify the specific calls of our chickadee population.
A spectrogram visualizes a chickadee call, with frequency on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.
Sofia Haley
I then use Raven Pro software, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, to visually inspect and analyze these calls on a spectrogram: a visual representation of sound, with frequency on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal axis. This visualization allows me to study the structure of calls in great detail.
Studying spectrograms can get me only so far. The next step is to experimentally test different “chick-a-dee” calls out in the wild. Using audio editing software, I manipulate the syntax of calls to either follow grammatical rules or violate them. Then, I broadcast these manipulated recordings out in the forest and observe how our chickadees react to grammatically incorrect calls, which would sound like gibberish to them.
Audio editing software allows researchers to mix up the order of a chickadee’s call in order to see how birds react to the garbled message. Sofia Haley
My hope is that this combination of experimental testing of calls and careful visual analysis will provide a step toward understanding the subtle complexities of chickadee communication. I’m trying to home in on the meaning of different syllables and syntax, the grammatical rules.
Back in the forest with my directional microphone, watching the chickadees flit about, I hear different versions of the “chick-a-dee” calls. Some feature more D notes, which would indicate a higher level of excitement. Others feature more A, B or C notes, communicating more specific, identifying information. I am also surrounded by melodic gargle calls, harsh scolding calls and barely audible soft calls.
Next time you find yourself out in the forest, stop and listen to the chickadees as they talk to each other. Maybe you’ll be able to hear the variation in their calls and know that they are talking about different things − and that grammar matters.

The recent shootings of Minnesota lawmakers is another reminder that Maryland's citizen legislators need our respect, whether we agree with them or not, for the work they step up to do. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matterws)Americans may yet get to know Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota state representative who was slain last week alongside her husband in a barbarous attack from a man who apparently loathed her politics. That’s if the news media can pause long enough in these tumultuous times to offer retrospectives about her estimable life and career.
What Marylanders need to know is that there are 188 Melissa Hortmans in our state legislature – and countless more serving in local political offices.
By that I mean there are scores of policymakers throughout Maryland who are living in our neighborhoods, lifting up their constituents and doing their best, whether you agree all the time with their politics or not, to improve our communities.
Which is what makes Hortman’s murder, and the grave wounding of another Democratic legislator, John Hoffman, so tragic and scary.
By all accounts, Hortman was a well-respected – even a beloved – figure in the Minnesota statehouse and in her district. She’s been called a compassionate lawmaker and a brilliant legislative tactician. She was a multifaceted woman of action with a strong moral compass and a tremendous sense of humor, and she seemed to know everyone and everything going on in her community. These are admirable qualities that we can see in many of our state lawmakers and local officials as well.
What do they do now?
Statewide officeholders, the mayor of Baltimore, executives of the biggest counties, and certain key members of Congress get police protection – all of the time, most of the time, or some of the time, depending on the offices and the circumstances. But members of the Maryland General Assembly – with the exception of the presiding officers – do not.

State lawmakers are out there in our communities; you may run into them at a neighborhood picnic or parade, at the grocery store, at your kids’ school, or anywhere else “real people” congregate.
Which, as the tragic events of this weekend show, makes these elected officials very vulnerable.
Marylanders celebrate their citizen legislature. Except in extraordinary circumstances, lawmakers meet for three months in Annapolis and then return to their lives and their jobs and hometowns. The system is designed to keep legislators focused when they’re in session and grounded and in close touch with their communities the rest of the year.
I’d argue that the state is reaching the point where it might be better-served by a full-time legislature, with vastly bigger staffs. That would lessen the influence of powerful special interests and their savvy and plugged-in lobbyists, who hold great sway over policy debates in Annapolis and often blunt the priorities of regular Marylanders.
But that’s a conversation for another day. Only 10 states currently have full-time legislatures.
National pundits have described Hortman’s assassination as a blow to democracy, another reminder that some Americans have become hostile to the concept of civil discourse and disagreeing agreeably with political opponents. But it’s also a blow for democracy because it will inevitably mean less access for everyday citizens to their political leaders.
I remember the pre-9/11 days when security at the Maryland State House was so loose that you get could to within 20 feet of the governor’s office before a cop would even ask you who you were. Now, only two of the five entrances to the building are open to the public, and unless you have certain ID cards you have to go through magnetometers to get into the State House and every other building in the legislative complex.
It’s easy enough, after the violence in Minnesota, to imagine even greater restrictions on access to legislative buildings and official proceedings in the days ahead. And, understandably, how anxious will elected officials be to hold public events in their communities? How equipped are law enforcement agencies around our state to adequately secure all the public meetings that take place on a regular basis?
These are the times we live in: The U.S. Capitol Police, which monitors “concerning statements or direct threats” to members of Congress, logged almost 9,500 cases in 2024. That compares to 3,900 cases in 2017. It’s pretty safe to assume that the same trend holds at the state and local levels in Maryland and elsewhere.
Hours after Hortman’s death, all the Democrats and all the Republicans in Minnesota’s congressional delegation released a joint statement mourning her loss, decrying the violence and urging more civility in the body politic. The fact that something so decent and obvious seemed so unusual in our current era was really depressing.
I’m as cynical about politics and politicians as the next person. But there are times when our political leaders deserve some grace.
Whenever I moderate a candidate forum I try to remind the audience of how difficult it is to run for office and how many personal sacrifices an individual has to make to become a candidate. I ask audience members, regardless of who they’re supporting, to give a round of applause to the candidates just for putting themselves out there and being willing to enter the political fray.
We need more good people, not fewer, participating in the political process. If personal safety and the safety of one’s family now becomes part of the calculation for deciding whether to run for office, then surely we will have fewer good people stepping forward than we did before. And that is just another tragic result of this weekend’s shootings in Minnesota.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0502-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

I was proud to be part of the No Kings protest, and glad to see such a large turnout at the Burlington waterfront. But I was uncomfortable with all of the Palestinian flags.
The point of this demonstration was to protest what is happening here. By including all these flags, it made demonstrators feel like they were also endorsing a position in support of Palestine.
There are many bad things happening in the world including a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But if one polled the demonstrators, I doubt there is a broad consensus as to what the United States should do. And what about Ukraine? If we wanted to expand the demonstration to world events, why weren’t there any Ukrainian flags?

It is imperative that we continue to advocate and demonstrate for world peace. But, that is not why we showed up on June 14. We came to protest the unconscionable things happening in the United States, nicely captured in the slogan “No Kings”. For this protest, we should be waving American flags.

While educators say the changes are necessary to address disruptive post-pandemic classroom behavior, the policies are drawing criticism from some student and family advocates.
The Washington state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction adopted the updated discipline rules on June 10.
Last August, the agency enacted an emergency version of the rules, “in response to ongoing confusion and challenges surrounding the interpretation” of existing policies set in 2019.
Those emergency rules provide the foundation for the permanent update, which will take effect July 11.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said last week in an emailed statement to the Standard that the updated rules will keep limits in place on long-term suspensions and expulsions, maintain expectations for schools to communicate with families over student behavior issues and cut down on bureaucracy.
“Student behaviors have worsened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased prevalence of cell phones, anxiety over local and global crises, and more, and the former rules created a disincentive to address classroom behaviors in the moment,” Reykdal said.
However, some student advocates have said the new rules undermine student protections and that Reykdal’s office did not seek enough community feedback.
“Talking with community partners, family groups, et cetera, I think everyone’s pretty much in agreement that it’s a rollback of student discipline reforms that were made in 2019,” said League of Education Voters Foundation Chief Engagement Officer Eric Holzapfel.
A nonprofit that conducts policy and research around equity in education, the League of Education Voters Foundation has opposed the discipline policy changes since the emergency rules were enacted last year.
In a letter sent out to supporters in March, the League of Education Voters Foundation warned that the new rules “could lead to increased exclusion from classrooms, disproportionately affecting students of color, students with disabilities, students in foster care, students experiencing homelessness, and other vulnerable students.”
Specific concerns cited by the group included the possibility of students being removed from class without support, loosening rules around alternative discipline, weaker state guidance on when to exclude students from class and weaker parent notification requirements.
Derick Harris, executive director of the Black Education Strategy Roundtable, also voiced criticism in an article published last month by Public News Service.
“This appears to me to be some rollback to a bygone era of zero-tolerance policy … Which we know within the Black community is a streamlined pathway from the school to the prison,” Harris said.
Developing the rules
The emergency rules implemented last August changed the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction’s discipline policies by providing definitions for discipline, corrective action, classroom exclusion, and emergency removal of a student from school.
Under these rules, teachers can exclude students from the classroom for a maximum of two days at a time if their district’s local policy allows for it.
The emergency rules also removed a provision requiring educators to “identify other forms of discipline that school personnel should administer before or instead of administering classroom exclusion, suspension, or expulsion.”
This provision isn’t in the new permanent rules, either. But Katie Hannig, a spokesperson for the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, said Wednesday that “the updated rules do not remove the requirement for educators to consider alternative disciplinary actions prior to classroom exclusion.”
She pointed to a different part of the rules that says, “Except in emergency circumstances, the teacher first must attempt one or more alternative forms of corrective action.”
The primary difference between the emergency and permanent rules is that under the new permanent rules, schools must collect data on disciplinary actions taken at each school and submit it to a statewide database.

OSPI collaborated with the Association of Washington School Principals, the Washington Association of School Administrators, the Washington State School Directors’ Association and the Washington Education Association when crafting the 2024 emergency rules.
Washington Educators Association Soundview Council President Filma Fontanilla described the rules as “a step forward.”
“Educators need additional resources to support students in meeting behavioral expectations and to address their unmet needs. WEA members spoke out and OSPI heard us,” Fontanilla said in an emailed statement.
Concerns about public input
The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction began the permanent rulemaking process in October 2024 and filed proposed permanent rules based on the emergency rules in January.
There were opportunities for public comment on the proposed permanent rules between late February and early March of this year, including at four in-person meetings in the Tri-Cities area, Spokane, Federal Way, and Vancouver. The process to enact the emergency rules did not require the agency to seek public comment.
While League of Education Voters Foundation staff attended OSPI’s public hearings and participated in the public comment period earlier this year, Holzapfel said the nonprofit still found the state agency’s community engagement lacking.
“We’re really concerned about the lack of public hearings that there were, the lack of announcement around them,” Holzapfel said. “They weren’t really communicated to local schools or parent groups or student groups in the area.”
The four public hearings were each held from 4 to 6 p.m., which Holzaphel said limited in-person access to parents and students.
The League of Education Voters Foundation had a meeting with OSPI staff about their concerns on May 29.
Holzapfel said the group’s main ask was to “start this process over” and bring more voices into the process, including young people who’ve faced disciplinary action.
“Let’s bring in parent groups, let’s bring in student groups, and let’s have a holistic discussion on what our values are, what the intentions are of these rules,” he said.
While a second meeting has been scheduled, Holzaphel said that agency staff have indicated the permanent discipline policies will go into effect unchanged on July 11.
“We are committed to monitoring the implementation of the updated rules closely and making adjustments as needed,” Reykdal said.

After years of insisting it would soon move to an all-electric lineup of cars and light trucks, GM is tapping the brakes on EVs and accelerating investment in U.S.-built, fossil fuel-powered vehicles the automaker has admitted are a major contributor to global warming.
What gives? Three factors: less-than-anticipated consumer demand for EVs, President Donald Trump’s trade war and the president’s distaste for cars that don’t run on gasoline.
The Detroit automaker announced on June 10 that it will spend $4 billion over the next two years to shift some production to two U.S. factories from Mexican plants and convert a Michigan plant from planned EV production to build gas-powered vehicles.
And last month, GM nixed a plan to spend $300 million to build electric vehicle motors at its Tonawanda, New York engine plant. Instead, it will invest $888 million in the 87-year-old factory to make V-8 gas engines. The company said the investment is its largest ever in an engine plant.
Included in GM’s new investments is the idled Orion Assembly plant in Oakland County that was being retooled to build full-size electric pickups. GM recently abandoned that plan. The sprawling plant will now build gas-powered SUVs and pickups.

The announcement came as a huge relief to state and local officials who faced the prospect of potentially losing a massive assembly plant that once employed thousands of workers.
Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said GM’s Orion investment “is fantastic news and a powerful tribute to the enduring legacy of auto manufacturing in the state.”
GM’s news release did not cite any new jobs being created from its $4 billion plant investment. Spokesman Kevin Kelly said the company will announce more job details as it gets closer to product launches in the plants.
The automaker still plans to add the 2,350 new jobs it announced in 2022 for the Orion EV conversion, Kelly said.
GM isn’t completely walking away from electric vehicles, which are needed to address climate change.  It offers 13 EV models with more in the pipeline.
The automaker said it sold 62,000 EVs this year through May and surpassed Ford to become a distant second to Tesla in EV sales.
But EV sales have lagged far below what automakers and analysts had believed would occur by now.  GM has all but abandoned its goal of selling only electric vehicles by 2035.
Consumers will largely dictate how soon GM completes its total transition to EVs, GM CEO Mary Barra has been saying in recent months.
But the automaker’s big U-turn on EVs also reflects the enormous pressure the White House is exerting on the highly regulated auto industry.
Trump has been strong-arming automakers, foreign and domestic, to build all the vehicles they sell here on U.S. soil by slapping punishing tariffs on their imported vehicles.
He and the Republican-controlled Congress also have proposed measures that would likely cripple the nascent EV industry. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” moving through Congress would eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit on EVs and dump the Biden-era battery production tax credits.
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. recently said the loss of battery tax credits would imperil the automaker’s $3 billion investment in its under-construction Marshall battery plant, which is expected to employ 1,700 workers.
A new report by Bloomberg NEF has cut 14 million battery-powered vehicles from its sales forecast through 2030, citing Trump’s anti-EV policies.
Automakers are being whipsawed between Trump’s actions toward the industry and those of his predecessor, President Joe Biden.
Biden attempted to push the industry to rapidly switch to battery-powered vehicles by offering them billions of dollars in incentives to make the conversion.
He set a goal of having 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric by 2030 and enacted tough tailpipe emission standards that would have hastened EV production. The Trump administration is rolling back those measures.
GM was all-in on Biden’s EV plans and now publicly supports many of Trump’s moves to reshape the auto industry.
Barra recently told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s tariffs can “level the playing field” for domestic and foreign automakers. And she successfully lobbied the president to revoke California’s right to ban gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035 and set its own tailpipe emission rules.
GM, which once supported California’s emission standards, and other automakers opposed California’s EV ban, saying the deadline would be impossible to meet.
The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page has criticized Barra for shifting with the political winds on tariffs and EVs. One of its columnists said Barra’s backing of Trump’s economic agenda questions her commitment to EVs.
I think that’s a bit unfair. GM for decades has been working to phase out the internal combustion engine with new technologies, including EVs and future hydrogen-powered vehicles. Its EV sales are growing.
Captains of industry also know it’s bad for business to publicly tangle with a president, particularly one as vengeful as Trump.
But I hope Barra is privately trying to convince Trump that EVs can help save the planet and work toward his goal of having a fully made-in-the-USA auto industry.
An annual report on the most American-made vehicles has just been released by Cars.com. And guess what? Six of the top 10 are EVs.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-723504579-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Its supporters are trying to preserve some remnants.,"Bridgette Edwards poses with Karl Turk, the Jobs for America's Graduates specialist who has become a ""father figure,"" during a June 2025 visit to her chosen Indiana State University. (Courtesy photograph)Bridgette Edwards is going to college.
The 18-year-old graduated from Cloverdale High School last month despite a “rocky” start. After two years enrolled in career success classes with roots in dropout prevention, she’s gained a “family” of classmates, a “father figure” of a teacher and a vision for her future.
It’s “surreal,” she told the Capital Chronicle.
“Freshman-year me would have never thought that now I’d be going to Indiana State University and going to pursue my dreams,” Edwards said. “I just got an apartment for myself and all that. She definitely would have probably slapped me in the face, like, ‘You’re lying to me; what are you talking about?'”
Edwards is among thousands of Hoosier students participating in the Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG) program. After undergoing a massive expansion, Indiana now hosts 250 sites — the nation’s largest network, according to the Department of Workforce Development (DWD). The agency oversees JAG in Indiana.
But JAG is expected to shrink to 30 or fewer sites by the end of the year.
Within just six months of hitting the 250-site goal, the program’s dedicated state funding was eliminated. Federal dollars shared by other agencies were deemed “unavailable.”
That’s left administrators, parents, teachers and students in the lurch — and trying preserve some remnants.
“This is ending the JAG program as we have come to know it in the state of Indiana,” Indiana Workforce Alliance Chair Tony Waterson said. The organization represents the 12 local workforce development boards that administer JAG in Indiana.
“Now, can it be reinvented? Yes. Will it sustain in some fashion? Most likely, (but) on a much, much reduced scale,” said Waterson, who is also president and CEO of board Southern Indiana Works.
Joining JAG
The model dates back to 1979 in Delaware, but former Gov. Mitch Daniels brought it to Indiana in 2006 to address the state’s “growing dropout crisis,” according to a DWD timeline.
JAG participants often face challenges that make it more likely they won’t complete high school or successfully transition into what lies after graduation. They may be low-income, first-generation, struggling with transportation, lacking workforce experience or marketable skills, and so on, per the national organization’s annual report.
In its first year, the program served 217 students at 12 schools.
It’s educated 45,000 since then. And it was set to serve more.
The expansion, which was fully implemented this year and doubled program sites from 125 to 250, was expected to impact 10,000 students annually.
Participants take elective, for-credit classes taught by specialists who also provide advice and other support. They meet multiple times each week, building close relationships.
“When we first got into our class, … you had your friends, but you didn’t really know everybody. But once we got to the end of the year, everybody was like a family,” Edwards said.
She recalled career association days featuring healthy student debate alongside visits from working professionals and educational institutions.










People are nice about it, right? Like, 'Oh, here's some options.' But we're not really going to be able to go to a private foundation and ask for $30 million annually for the foreseeable future, right? ... That's just not something that's realistic.


– Indiana Workforce Alliance Chair Tony Waterson


She’d long harbored dreams of becoming a nurse, but a school resource officer’s presentation prompted a new dream. Now, Edwards will enter college studying criminology and criminal justice, with the goal of becoming a forensic scientist or police officer.
JAG, she said, “made me understand more of what I wanted to be for the rest of my life.” She’s also learned how to manage a credit card, present herself professionally to adults and more.
That’s thanks to specialist Karl Turk, whom she called “a father figure to me.” Edwards’ biological father died when she was 11.
But employees like him are in jeopardy.
There are “close to 300 JAG team members whose budget just went from $27 million to, you know, zero,” Waterson said. Some roles may be retained, but “there’s going to be a loss of jobs.”
“Every JAG specialist is touching, you know, 40 to 60 kids. And so now you’re impacting them and their lives as well,” he added. “… It’s a tough day, you know, tough week, tough month, tough budget cycle.”
Dedicated funding dropped
DWD previously received $8 million per year for JAG via a “dropout prevention” line item in the state’s biennial budget.
Gov. Mike Braun kept that in his version of House Enrolled Act 1001.
House Republicans scrapped DWD’s line item and instead included “dropout prevention” under the lengthy list of ways the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) could spend an $86 million “Freedom and Opportunity in Education” fund.
Republicans finalize $44 billion budget, while Democrats point to missed opportunities

“When JAG funding was eliminated in DWD’s budget, it did not get moved to IDOE,” spokeswoman Courtney Bearsch said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle.
The Senate GOP maintained this in later versions of the budget.
But, with just a week to finalize the legislation, fiscal leaders received a grim revenue forecast — and embarked on major cuts.
“You know, when you’re all of a sudden hit with a budget that says you’re going to have little over a billion less each year, a lot of stuff got caught in the crossfire,” Braun told reporters last week.
The fund was allotted $50 million in the final version. That’s the same amount of money IDOE got for literacy and a similar list of other efforts in the last budget. And, like most agencies, it was hit with a 5% budget cut and directed to withhold additional dollars.
“Due to significant budget constraints, the IDOE will also not be able to utilize state funding to sustain JAG,” DWD Chief Workforce Officer Katie Rounds wrote in a late May program update.
Indiana’s fiscal year – and JAG’s line item funding – ends June 30.
Funding flow set to a trickle
The line item isn’t even the largest source of funding cut from JAG.
A collaboration with the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) was set to direct an additional $23.1 million in federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars to fund the expansion, former Gov. Eric Holcomb announced in August 2023. That goal became reality in December 2024, per DWD.
The agency spent $13.3 million from TANF on JAG in the last program cycle, but FSSA is closing the spigot in August.
Rounds wrote that the TANF money is now “unavailable” for JAG.
That came as a shock to Waterson and his fellow workforce development board leaders.
“It was a question we asked repeatedly as we ramped up from 125 to 250: was the funding secure into the future? … And we were assured that that funding was secured,” he recounted.
To pull off the expansion, workforce development board members met with students, parents, teachers and administrators at middle schools, high schools and higher educational institutions.
“They signed and bought into the idea of it,” Waterson said. “They said, ‘Okay, we trust you.’ We hired staff.”
“We wouldn’t have done all that had we thought that this was even a possibility,” he added.
Students who’d joined in an initial round of the expansion would’ve been entering their second year of JAG come August, while those part of a later round would’ve gotten started at that point.
“We’ve told these these kids that, you know, you’re committing to us for two years when you do this — actually, three years, because there’s a follow-up period,” Waterson continued. “And now we’re saying, ‘Wait, no, we can’t.'”
Another slice of federal funding contributed by FSSA, typically worth $1.5 million annually, also won’t come JAG’s way. The Vocational Rehabilitation Pre-Employment Transition Services dollars supported disabled student participation for at least five years, according to DWD, including $2.2 million in the last program cycle.
“For that money to be available, you have to have … non-federal matching funds,” Waterson explained. “That gets dicey if there’s no state allocation.”
JAG’s only intact source of public funding may be federal legislation that expired five years ago. Initiatives under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) operate through annual appropriations, according to bipartisan group Center Forward.
But WIOA Youth money also comes with complex requirements — and deep uncertainty about how Congress will fund it going forward.
That leaves private and philanthropic dollars, which added more than $1.2 million to JAG in the last program cycle.
“People are nice about it, right? Like, ‘Oh, here’s some options.’ But we’re not really going to be able to go to a private foundation and ask for $30 million annually for the foreseeable future, right?” Waterson said. “That’s just not something that’s realistic.”
Looking forward
JAG and other efforts hit in last-minute cuts could “be reconstituted,” according to Braun.
“That is going to be part of — on every agency, every program, we’re going to make sure that it’s being run well, (and it) may end up needing more resources if it’s been starved of it,” he said.

But potential aid in the future won’t stave off closures now.
They’ll likely occur in two waves, according to Waterson: most programs that were supposed to begin in August won’t, and most of those that do will shut down after the first semester.
In the meantime, he and other workforce development board leaders are regrouping.
“We are trying to find ways to salvage programming and salvage service to young people, either through alternative partnerships or alternative funding mechanisms,” said Edmond C. O’Neal III, president and CEO of Northeast Indiana Works.
O’Neal’s board is also rethinking how it structures program delivery.
Instead of assuming that one JAG specialist equals one site, he said, “I’d prefer to try to leverage those … people to service as many kids as we can.”
Five specialists, for example, could travel to handle 15 sites, although that introduces logistical challenges.
“It sucks,” Edwards said of JAG’s dim prospects.
“I just don’t think a lot of people are really seeing the good things that come out of it; they just see the academic value,” she added. “Even the students that people may think are quote-unquote ‘a lost cause,’ even those kids, it helps them a lot, getting out of trouble, learning their value of life.”

DeSantis’ veto pen.
  Patt Maney via Florida House
  Ileana Garcia via Florida Senate
The $1 million proposal was included in the Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice budget chaired by Okaloosa County Republican state Rep. Patt Maney and Miami-Dade County Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia. Their insertion of the funding comes a year after Ron DeSantis vetoed a $2 million request to continue the program, and two years after an initial $1 million pilot program for free calls was enacted.
“Thank you to Chair Garcia, Chair Maney, and committee staff for restoring funding for the prison phone calls program,” said Graham Bernstein, who as a member of the Florida Student Policy Forum at the University of Florida researched the idea and brought it to local and state public officials a few years ago. 
“OPPAGA (the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability) reports and other evidence shows that this policy reduces recidivism by helping inmates who demonstrate good behavior stay connected with the outside world, saves the families of the incarcerated money, and lowers taxpayer spending on re-incarceration.”
In Florida’s correction system, inmates may only make collect calls, for which vendor ViaPath Technologies charges $13.5 cents a minute. As part of that contract with the Department of Corrections, they are allowed two free five-minute phone calls per month.
As Bernstein notes, independent studies have shown the benefits of allowing inmates to keep in contact with loved ones. A 2006 report from the Urban Institute found that within five years of release, incarcerated people with strong family connections were 25% more likely to cease criminal activity. A 2005 report on incarcerated mothers’ contact with children found that telephone calls, even more than physical visits, related to positive maternal perceptions of relationships with children.
“We should not punish the family for the sins of a single family member,” said Konstantin Nakov, who worked with Bernstein on researching the high costs of prison phone calls while at the Florida Student Policy Forum. “Children should not be punished for the crime their parent committed. This appropriation aims to reconnect a bond that may have been severed by incarceration by assuring that the families of those who are in prison are not drawn into poverty to make phone calls.”
Karen Stuckey is a prison reform advocate. She worked with then Broward County Democratic state Sen. Lauren Book on a proposal during the 2022 session requiring the Department of Corrections to provide inmates phone calls free of charge. Her bill didn’t acquire a House sponsor and died without being heard in any committee.
“Access to a parent in prison is difficult, high price of email, phone calls and travel, yet we know how important it is for children to have a bond with their parents,” said Stuckey, who had to deal at one point in her life with escalating phone bills as both her son and husband had been incarcerated in Florida prisons.
“We’ve had productive discussions with the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget on this matter and hope that the Governor will support the Legislature’s decision,” Bernstein said.
The budget sent to his desk is slated to begin July 1, the start of the 2025-2026 fiscal year, although he is expected to veto certain line items before then.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics this month, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson has found a new leader for the Health Care Authority, which administers Medicaid for nearly 2 million people and is the largest purchaser of health care in the state.
Ferguson announced Wednesday that he had selected Maryland Deputy Health Secretary Ryan Moran, who oversees Medicaid and health care financing in that state. Moran’s first day is Aug. 18 and he will earn an annual salary of $251,208.
“I look forward to advancing the work and mission of the agency in such a critical time for health care nationally and am committed to ensuring those we serve receive access to integrated, person-centered care,” Moran said in a statement.
Ferguson said in a statement that Moran’s passion and experience make him a great choice. 
“His expertise will help us provide equitable, high-quality health care to the people of Washington,” Ferguson added.
Moran joined the Maryland Department of Health in April 2023 and is deputy secretary for Health Care Financing and Medicaid director. He will continue in those positions until August, Maryland Matters reported.
In February, he stepped in as acting secretary when the former health secretary left amid several controversies. Moran held the post until April, when Meena Seshamani took over as secretary.
Moran previously served as chief executive officer for Whitman-Walker Health System in the District of Columbia and as an assistant vice president for MedStar Health, which has 10 hospitals in Maryland and Washington, D.C., according to Ferguson’s office.
He holds a doctorate in public health from Johns Hopkins University and is a board member of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.
Moran will arrive as Washington, like Maryland and other states, is preparing for the likelihood that the Trump Administration and Republican-controlled Congress will reduce federal funding for Medicaid. 
Washington officials have said as many as 194,000 residents could lose Medicaid coverage under legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that is pending in the Senate. Ferguson has said Washington would lose about $2 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next four years under the bill.
About two dozen Washington state Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, urged the 12-member congressional delegation to avoid cuts that would imperil the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health.
And Moran will begin work as the Health Care Authority ponders a response to the unauthorized sharing of protected health information for the state’s Apple Health enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security. That data could potentially be used to track down immigrants without legal status.
As of this spring, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children.
“This is an unethical use of protected health information,” authority officials said in a June 13 statement. “We would never support the use of data submitted for health care purposes being repurposed by federal agencies seeking to unjustly target specific groups of individuals.”
Moran will replace MaryAnne Lindeblad, a veteran authority leader who has served as interim director since director Sue Birch retired when Ferguson took office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ryan-moran-hca-director-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina colleges continue to hold tuition steady for in-state students.
The governing boards of both Clemson University and the University of South Carolina voted last week to freeze tuition rates for a sixth and seventh consecutive year, respectively. Other state schools, including the College of Charleston and Coastal Carolina University, are doing the same.
Tuition for in-state undergraduates at the four largest universities in the state ranges from $11,640 per year at Coastal to $15,120 at Clemson.
“Clemson University remains committed to providing an affordable, accessible and quality education,” board chairwoman Kim Wilkerson said in a statement.
While tuition won’t go up, housing and meal plans will.
For example, USC will charge about $660 more on average for housing and meals in the upcoming school year, similar to increases for the school year that ended in May.
The other schools did not provide exact figures for fee increases.
The holds on tuition for South Carolinians attending the state’s public universities follow $65 million allocated by legislators in the state budget in exchange for the continued freeze — a priority pushed by Gov. Henry McMaster. The Republican governor pledged to veto a proposal that would have allowed universities to raise costs for incoming freshmen.
The budget’s distribution specifically for “tuition mitigation” ranges from $412,000 for USC’s Salkehatchie campuses in rural Allendale and Walterboro to $14.4 million for USC’s main campus in Columbia. The Medical University of South Carolina’s share is $12.5 million, while Clemson’s is $12.2 million.
The budget that takes effect July 1 additionally provides public colleges more than $500 million for projects that renovate existing buildings, build new facilities and establish new programs.
“The General Assembly has demonstrated its robust support for higher education in this year’s state budget,” USC President Michael Amiridis said in a statement.
SC colleges have frozen tuition for several years. University presidents say that’s not sustainable.

Students coming to South Carolina from other states for college will continue to see costs go up — 3% at USC and Clemson.
At the College of Charleston, where President Andrew Hsu has expressed concerns about the college pricing itself out of the market for students from other states, out-of-state rates will rise 1.5%. Coastal, which has the highest concentration students from other state, will raise out-of-state tuition 1%.
Students coming from outside South Carolina face a sticker price about three times that of in-state students.
“At the College of Charleston, we are deeply committed to keeping education within reach,” board Chairwoman Renee Romberger said in a statement.
“With the continued support of the South Carolina General Assembly, we’ve been able to hold tuition steady for our in-state students and keep increases for out-of-state students modest – because we believe that every student deserves access to a high-quality, affordable education.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/usc.flags_.horseshoe.000006-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-06-23 08:07:10.633550

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana is in the midst of redesigning its public higher education ecosystem. In recent years, state leaders have pursued reforms aimed at making institutions more accountable, efficient, and closely aligned with workforce needs. These efforts respond to a growing and legitimate public concern: is higher education delivering what Indiana and its taxpayers need?
What’s often missing from the conversation, however, is the recognition that not all higher education institutions are built the same — or should be treated the same. Indiana’s two- and four-year institutions serve different missions and student populations. Policy that ignores these differences risks unintended consequences for institutions, the students they serve, and the state’s postsecondary attainment goals.
Ivy Tech taps Kentucky school superintendent as new leader

Consider Ivy Tech Community College, the state’s unified community college system. It fulfills two essential missions: preparing Hoosiers for high-wage, high-demand jobs in current and emerging industries, and offering an affordable, seamless pathway to four-year degrees. Nearly 70 percent of Ivy Tech’s 200,000 students attend part time. About 25 percent care for a dependent, and 40 percent are the first in their families to attend college. More than 90 percent live in Indiana and attend their local campus, and most stay in Indiana after graduation.
As the state’s open-access institution, Ivy Tech is built to meet learners where they are while helping employers address talent shortages. Its mission and student body require a different operating model than other public colleges and universities.
For example, Ivy Tech does not have a tenure system. Most faculty are part-time, on short-term contracts, and often still work in the fields they teach — keeping instruction highly relevant to industry needs. Ivy Tech is also non-residential, with facilities focused on classrooms, labs, and essential student services.
This model limits revenue streams that other institutions rely on. Ivy Tech doesn’t generate income from student housing, dining, or parking. It doesn’t have lucrative athletics programs or collect research royalties that support many public universities.
Keeping to the mission
And, in the face of statewide funding reductions, Ivy Tech has continued to prioritize affordability. In 2023, it introduced a simplified tuition model that eliminated mandatory fees—saving students money but reducing institutional revenue by $5.6 million annually.
When it became clear that textbook costs were a barrier to learning, Ivy Tech used its statewide scale to negotiate better prices. Now, students pay a flat, per-credit-hour fee for required textbooks — helping them plan financially and saving them more than $65 million since the program began. This shift cost Ivy Tech $4 million in annual commission revenue, but it put student success first.
These reforms are producing real results. Nearly half of all credentials awarded by Indiana’s public colleges last year came from Ivy Tech. Since 2016, completions have more than doubled. Over 80% of graduates leave without student loan debt, and more than half earn above the state median wage within three years. These outcomes are not only boosting individual prosperity — they are strengthening Indiana’s workforce and tax base.

Enrollment growth and expanding partnerships further underscore Ivy Tech’s value. Companies like Stellantis and Entek cite the College’s workforce pipeline as a factor in their investment decisions. Looking ahead, Ivy Tech is positioned to help Indiana grow talent in industries like semiconductors, biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, and clean energy.
As national organizations like the Lumina Foundation call for 70% of Americans to earn a degree or credential beyond high school, institutions like Ivy Tech will be critical to reaching that goal. Especially in a state where many learners are working adults or place-bound, Ivy Tech’s reach and design make it indispensable.
Indiana’s higher education system must evolve, but that evolution must be informed by mission. As state leaders push for results, they must also account for how institutions are structured to deliver them. Treating all colleges the same risks undermining the very progress reforms aim to achieve. Ivy Tech’s model — student-centered, cost-conscious, and workforce-aligned — is not an exception to the system. It is where higher education should be going if we’re to win the future.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A federal magistrate judge in Nashville has denied the government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to a Salvadoran prison by U.S. immigration officials.
Federal prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to appeal the decision. Both the decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and the notice of appeal were filed Sunday.
In denying the government’s motion to keep Abrego detained, Holmes acknowledged that if he is released he will likely be taken into custody immediately by  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
Nevertheless, Holmes wrote, “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed federal prosecutors’ arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager as lacking clear evidence.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny to Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on June 19.
The Vermont Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the developer looking to build on the 7-acre slice of land next to South Burlington’s Wheeler Nature Park.
The decision issued last month affirms the Vermont Environmental Court’s decision that also favored the development following a six-day trial last summer.
But appellants James Leas and two other neighboring residents, Alan Luzzatto and Jeanne Zagursky, have not given up the battle to protect the property from development. Earlier this month, they filed a motion that requests that the court restore the case to the calendar for resubmission of briefs and arguments, which they say the court misapprehended in its decision.
The project calls for 32 mixed-housing units directly adjacent to Wheeler Nature Park, an area in the city that has long been designated as an area of high public value. The parcel sits at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road in South Burlington, part of a larger area that itself was once the subject of a lengthy court case.
Although the project’s developers won development review board approval in 2021 and Act 250 approval in 2022, the project was quickly appealed by a group of 125 nearby neighbors from the Inverness, Glen Eagles and Villas at Water Tower Hill homeowners’ associations and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting. That decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court in September.
Key issues for the appellants include their contention that the scenic view of the Green Mountains over the nature park would be disturbed, as would the wildlife from the blasting of rock needed to build the homes. Overall aesthetics and undue traffic burdens were also mentioned as concerns.
They argue the development would “demolish” the nature park and ultimately “destroy” the “last traditional Vermont view of the Green Mountains from those recreation paths” adjacent to the property.
However, the environmental court sided with the developer last summer, finding that the project complies with Act 250 criteria for aesthetics, noise and traffic, adding that the project is consistent with the characteristics of the residential area where the development is planned to be.
But residents contend that city plans and reports have called for this land to be preserved in perpetuity, and they say it should be.
The 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park has had years of legal history since it was first acquired by the city in 1993. The parcel at the heart of this latest court battle was first created in 2015, the result of a settlement with landowner JAM Golf that included swapping these 7 acres for 22 acres that have been conserved forever as part of Wheeler Nature Park. A second amended agreement between the parties was reached in 2017.
The land swap was approved by city voters in 2011, although the vote, according to former city attorney Jim Barlow at a council meeting in 2015, was not legally binding and only considered a “good faith” gesture on the part of the city.
That agreement created specific zoning for the parcel and ultimately laid out specific development guidelines.
But neighbors throughout the court case have claimed that this 2015 agreement between the landowner and the city was “improper.”
Appellants in their most recent motion bring up nine points — or as they call them, “a stack of errors” — they hope to reargue in court.
“We believe review of the points of law that the court overlooked or misapprehended would affect the result,” they wrote.

In March, Smith took the helm herself. 
She hopes to provide more stability in leading the agency which has seen growing scrutiny over the last several years from nearly every direction — including lawmakers, judges, advocates and the media.  
Children’s Division is Missouri’s child welfare agency and is responsible for overseeing foster care, working on frontline child abuse and neglect investigations and managing calls to the child abuse and neglect hotline.

There are over 11,000 Missouri children in foster care, as of May, which is down from a peak of over 14,000 in 2021. The state continues to take kids into care at a rate higher than the national average, and is slower to reunite families than the national average. 
Children’s Division is acting under a performance improvement plan with the federal government over issues ranging from failure to provide timely permanent placements for kids to caseworkers failing to provide sufficient engagement with parents. 
Lawmakers over the years have also raised concern about missing foster kids, unlicensed boarding schools and severe understaffing.
In a brief sit-down with The Independent last week, Smith said she wants to bring Children’s Division back to the basics, which she defines as ensuring safety for children. She highlighted her long experience in the agency, beginning as a frontline child abuse and neglect investigator.
She took over from Darrell Missey, who was outspoken about what he felt was a needed course correction for the agency that was taking too many kids into foster care and keeping them there too long. Missey spent his career as a judge before leading Children’s Division, and his vision reflected a national trend toward family preservation efforts.
Smith, on the other hand, said she doesn’t see reducing the number of kids in foster care as an especially valuable metric. She highlighted several policies during the 30-minute interview, including: 

She supports increasing Temporary Alternative Placement Agreements, which provides removal of children from the home for no more than 90 days into relatives’ care. The parent or guardian voluntarily enters into a TAPA with the Children’s Division, and it can only be done when the child is not in imminent risk. The practice has been criticized nationally and in Missouri as a type of “hidden foster care,” but proponents argue it helps keep kids safe without the trauma of foster care.
She sees the juvenile office as an important check on Children’s Division’s power, ensuring kids are only being removed when there’s a legally-supported reason. The juvenile office is an agency whose role is unique to Missouri’s child welfare system.  Some legal experts have called it unconstitutional. The juvenile office, within the judiciary branch, prosecutes child abuse and neglect cases side-by-side with Children’s Division, and it is responsible for petitioning the court to remove kids, generally upon Children’s Division’s request.
She noted that there are currently no foster kids residing in offices, a practice that has drawn criticism, but there are several staying in hotels because they don’t have anywhere else to go.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
 What do you think you bring to the role having spent decades in the agency? 

Carrying a caseload as a frontline investigator really helped me understand. I remember the manila folders where I had files for each family, and I would carry those around and try to make sure — have I seen all the kids on this one? Have I seen all the kids on this one? And kind of triaging.
You could be down in Laclede County in Lebanon, and then get a report in Moniteau County and be in California, Missouri. That’s an hour and a half, two hours.
And so just knowing all of those factors, then you have to learn your partners, and every one of those circuits I needed to know law enforcement and courts and juvenile offices and city and county police officers, schools and so just the importance of having those relationships is one of the things that I learned that I think adds value to getting to see the full picture.
 Have the first three months on the job been what you expected?

I think it is more [than I expected], very honestly.
Having stepped away from Children’s Division for a couple of years and worked at Family Support Division, and then having an opportunity to work with some of our residential services, there are just different pieces.  We have more team members than we did two years ago. We have different-sized caseloads than we had a couple years ago. And so families, I think, coming out of COVID, have more unique sets of circumstances in some areas with the service array available. 
And so just being able to understand all that, to know how to help team members, has just been a little bit more challenging than I expected. It is definitely worth all of the time and effort though, that everybody’s putting into it.
 Do you think that Children’s Division deserves the scrutiny and reputation that it’s gotten over the last few years? 

I think there’s a lot to Children’s Division. Being in it for so long, it’s complicated, and it’s a space that, we respect families’ privacy, and we can only share certain things, and there’s a lot that we can’t share about the work that happens. And that’s really hard sometimes, because you want to be able to share all the complicating factors that are happening and the ins and outs of different pieces. But we can only talk about how the process should work in a best case scenario. 
And I don’t think we should necessarily talk about case specifics, because that is a family’s right to privacy. A child’s right to his or her information being kept close to the vest for Children’s Division, but then having the opportunity to be transparent with our stakeholders about what’s happening, what the pain points are and using those systemic things and trends to be able to work with them to create some change. 
Because I do think that lack of stability in the Children’s Division director role does play a part in the practice that people see and the partnerships. I think I’ve had nine (directors) since I started Children’s Division, and you know, I’ve heard this from Children’s Division team members like, ‘we’re just going to wait it out. There’ll be somebody else coming in with a different philosophical view.’ Or stakeholders that aren’t sure that you’re going to stay so they don’t take the time to really get to know you or what practice should look like.
Because we’re not adding anything new or different. It’s just following the policy and tools that we have already been provided by the legislators, and really helping support our team. And so I do think that in regard to the scrutiny, some of it is just building that trust factor. And that’s a really big part of our executive team, and I know the department as a whole, is being able to build trust with stakeholders.

 You mentioned philosophical differences. What do you see as the main differences between you and former director Darrell Missey? 

The director’s role is really hard as I mentioned. You know, being in this spot, everybody comes in with kind of their plan about how to fix the broken system, or how to help support kids and families better. 
And I don’t think that anybody would ever enter into this space and take on this role if they didn’t feel like they could make a difference. And so, for me, I think making sure that we are training really the basics, the back to basics. 
We have a workforce that really wants to know at the end of the day what their job is from day to day, and not as much of the philosophical, the ‘why’ behind certain practices. They’re not in it for the Social Work degree, in most cases, they are here trying to keep kids safe on a day-to-day basis.
And they want to know the practical tools and what they need to enter into the system, when they should notify the court, when they should reach out to law enforcement. 
So just having that expertise, coming from Children’s Division, I think that gives me just a little bit different lens, because I’ve worked in every single program area. And so being able to connect those pieces and know what the hand-off looks like, I think that gives me a little bit different flavor than some previous directors. 
 Where do staffing issues stand? 

The last time that I checked, we had around 52 vacancies statewide, which is really amazing, actually, for Children’s Division. We’re still at around 26% turnover statewide. And of that, 41% of that is our front line workers.
We really hear training is the biggest issue. And so that is one of our main priorities, is revamping the training to make it more practical. We are interested in shortening up the length of time as well that team members are in the initial training now, there’ll be some trainings that, once they get in and get comfortable and kind of know their role, some specialized trainings that we’ll be able to provide.
 Do you see training as potentially helping remedy some of the federal issues outlined in the Performance Improvement Plan, such as family engagement?

If you’re not meeting with families, how are you moving the needle towards permanence here, or identifying safety threats? I don’t think we can hang our hat there and not do any other work around things, but I do think solid training is going to set us up for a lot better success.
 I’ve heard you say in other interviews that reducing the number of kids in care is not a particularly valuable metric of progress. How should progress be measured?

To me, creating a culture that kids are safe whether they’re in the home, or if there’s a temporary alternative placement agreement in place, that they’re safe in that placement. Or if we have some intensive in-home services or if we may recommend to the juvenile office for removal and place them with a family member or another placement — that we’re really looking at safety no matter what placement the youth is in. 
And so, I think that a good metric for us would be: If we’ve had a touch with a family, are we thoroughly assessing safety and having them in the least restrictive setting possible, depending on what the allegations are, and then are we having another touch with that family later on? 
 Is the way I characterized your thoughts on lowering the number of foster kids accurate?

I think it’s an important metric, but I do think you’re accurate. I think that, it’s really looking at how many calls do we have to the hotline that year? Of those, how many were alerted to the field? Are we seeing kids? So what’s our response time to making sure that we’ve assessed the safety of kids? How fast or thoroughly are we giving families closure? So when are those reports closed? Are we meeting our monthly visits with families…how quickly are they going to permanency? 
And then how many kids do we have in care as a metric, but it’s more so, is it that they’re staying in care longer, or are we getting permanency in a timely manner? And so kind of that whole scorecard of our organizational health as an agency. So I wouldn’t drive that on just one metric unless I knew that my number of critical incidents and retouches with our system had gone down as well.
 Do you think that Missouri relies too heavily on foster care? That the portion of kids in care is higher here than in other states and people say neglect is often confused with poverty — do you think that’s an issue?

I think we’re lucky in Missouri to have what I would call kind of a bifurcated system. It’s something that a lot of other states don’t have. Children’s Division cannot remove a child. We would recommend removal to the juvenile office. So the juvenile office that’s receiving that referral, they’re making sure that it’s legally sufficient and that we should be recommending removal. 
And we have those [referrals] denied from Children’s Division where, Children’s Division might think that there’s a safety threat, the child can’t remain in the home. And the juvenile office might look at it and help us understand why that’s not a legally sufficient avenue. 
They’ve been really great partners to us in that space, but having that other look to make sure that you know whatever the concerns are, do meet legal standards, I think helps make me feel better, especially with our turnover rate, that the kids that are in care are actually there for a reason that is legally supported.
 So you see the juvenile office as an important check on Children’s Division’s power?

Yeah, and not a lot of other states have that. I mean, they would still go through a hearing in a lot of other states within certain timeframes depending on that state. 
But for Children’s Division to have that check on the front end, I think, is something that’s really valuable to us. And so we pull those numbers to look at different circuits. What does removal look like in our partnership with the juvenile office, and I think that’s really important.
  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
 You mentioned the temporary alternative placement agreements. In previous years, there’s been some concern — lawmakers have called them uncounted foster kids. Do you have any plans to make data surrounding TAPAs more transparent?

Definitely, that is something that we’ve been messaging, especially with our juvenile office partners, to make sure that they know that our circuit managers can provide them a listing of TAPAs. I mean, they should be notified, but we were hearing from some pockets that they weren’t receiving those notifications. And so we want to make sure that they know that they can continually get a list. 
We’re also working on how we could make kind of a public-facing dashboard with that, you know, that’s something that Director Bax, I think, is really big on — the transparency piece. 
So figuring out how we can get not just that data, but any of our data that we get a lot of requests for, or that there’s interest in, that we’re making sure to just try to make that as available as possible to, media partners, local counties — sometimes people are interested and they want to know what’s happening in their circuit — and so just trying to make that available.
 Why do you think those temporary placements are a tool that the state should rely on more?

Depending on what the concern is, it might be a safety threat that we would be able to mitigate within 30, 60, days, and be able to have supports wrapped around the family and, for the child to go home without entering Children’s Division custody. 
And so if that can safely be done, we should definitely be utilizing the TAPA. 
It just gives a little bit more formality to what in the old days, it was called a diversion. And I remember diverting a youth from a placement and kind of doing my investigation or assessment, and then there was no policy or procedure at that time, back in 2006, to close the case. And it’s like, okay, well, everything’s safe now, and you just closed it and so, but then that leaves everybody wondering, when can the child go back home? So this process of having a TAPA just really gives, I think, more support to the family.
 What about the federal Family First Prevention Services funding? Why do you think Missouri has lagged in spending it and what timeline is there now? 

I think that probably the stability in leadership plays a part in that, right? 
When you have multiple directors, just that transition, getting a spend plan, or getting that money out the door — I think that’s played a part of it. And just the ability for everyone to understand, since it was a little bit newer, how to do it, I think played a part.
 Is it true that a certain amount of money expires in October?

That’s correct. I think it was $10 million in transition funding that we got 2018, 2019, somewhere in there that will expire if it’s not expended by October. 
And so that is something that we’re trying to see what we’re able to get out the door by October in a meaningful way to help kids and families. That’s something that we’re definitely looking at, and was on our kind of first quarter plans to look at that and see what we can do.
I hate leaving money on the table. And so if we’re able to utilize that money here in Missouri, you know, let’s do it and let’s get it out the door.
 Are you hopeful about utilizing it in time?

I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to get it out the door. Coming in, in the eleventh hour, it kind of doesn’t set me up for the best success as a team for that, but I think we’re going to do our best. This exec team has a lot of support, and we’re going to try to do our best around that. 
 Regarding the problem with children staying in offices and hotels and residential treatment out of state, what kind of steps are you taking to alleviate those issues? And do you have a sense of how many kids are in those situations?

We definitely don’t have any kids in offices. 
We are utilizing hotels. Any time there’s a kiddo in a hotel, we are asking those to be sent up so we can try and help and support to make sure that that doesn’t happen proactively. 
That’s a priority. Is getting kids that are placed out of state and residential back into Missouri, and we’re excited about that, working with a lot of partners around what we need. 
So this is an issue around higher-acuity youth that people, legislators and stakeholders have been talking about for years.
And so I think we’ve admired the problem enough. I think we know what the problem is. And so how do we jump into some solutions to find them appropriate placement and supports here in Missouri, and to wrap services around them.
It was just Friday that I think at least three of us on the exec team were on a call for numerous hours with partners to try and strategize on how to help. The hospitals have been great partners to us, and so, trying to problem-solve and strategize on getting a youth some supports — and in some areas, there’s just not a lot of supports that are offered. And so how do we help make sure we can do that when there’s nothing in the area for that youth in that family. 
It’s something that takes more than just Children’s Division leaning in to help — hospitals, Department of Mental Health, Department of Health and Senior Services. Children’s Division doesn’t offer services. We work with others to get family services, and so we rely a lot on that provider network. Just working with our residential providers and acute and sub acuity settings to try to make sure that they feel that their programming is equipped enough to handle higher acuity youth, is something that almost everybody has come to the table wanting to help. 
And so we’re just really excited to see what action steps those individuals take to help Children’s Division and our contracted providers find spaces for these youth.
 It’s no secret that DSS has had trouble with its technology being old. I’ve encountered issues getting accurate data through Sunshine Requests, and I know others have had data issues, too. What do you think the roots of those problems are, and how do you plan to address them?

The department has made some efforts on bringing individuals on board that have a lot of IT knowledge. And so we’re excited that they’re in place and can help us in that space. 
And so we’re excited to have some IT team members on staff to be able to help us with this, because once we figure out the system and how that’s going to work, then the quality of data will help us be able to help kids and families better, and to be able to intelligently talk about the problems in a better way than we are able to today, to, media and partners.
I like the idea of sharing the data that we have now, whatever is available when we can that protects families’ privacy, because it’s at least a starting place. And that’s what we’re working with today. And so what we have today is what we’re going to use today, and then hope that it’s better as we go along. 
 Anything else?

Overall, I’m really excited to see over the next few months, and I would say, especially in a year — where Children’s Division is at in a year with our policy and practice and new training.
I think we’re going to be in a vastly different space than for people feeling comfortable in their work, and that’s what I’m most excited about, because when people feel comfortable and stakeholders trust us, then it’s only going to equal good things for kids and families.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061325_sarasmith4-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

The letter seeking the data of millions of food stamp recipients across the nation said the federal government intends to use the information to “ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.”  
SNAP recipient data has historically been kept by state governments and private vendors contracted to process payments.
USDA pauses request for personal data of SNAP recipients while lawsuit proceeds

More than 687,000 Tennesseans – or about one in every ten state residents – received the benefit as of April, according to data posted by the Department of Human Services. SNAP provides a monthly cash benefit loaded onto a debit card to be used for food purchases only. 
The federal government’s request, made in tandem with efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut spending across the federal government, stemmed from an executive order by President Donald Trump to stop waste, abuse and fraud in public spending. 
A lawsuit filed by advocacy groups on May 22 challenged the Trump administration’s authority to demand the data. That litigation remains ongoing. 
The Trump administration has since posted a message to states that its request has been temporarily halted until “requisite procedural safeguards have been met” but notes federal officials will be working with state agencies and their payment processors to “prepare for the eventual transfer of the data discussed in the (May 6) letter.”
Some states have outright refused to comply with the request, while others — such as Tennessee — have signaled they will provide recipients’ personal information. 
“Tennessee has received the request and is prepared to comply within the law,” Danielle Cotton, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Human Services, said via email.

Josh Hawley is presenting himself as the rare Republican willing to fight for low-income Americans who will lose their health care or food assistance if his party makes massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He has been rewarded with much credulous reporting suggesting he is sincere about that.     But as Missouri’s senior U.S. […],"U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15, 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is presenting himself as the rare Republican willing to fight for low-income Americans who will lose their health care or food assistance if his party makes massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He has been rewarded with much credulous reporting suggesting he is sincere about that.    
But as Missouri’s senior U.S. senator and former attorney general, it’s fair to expect Hawley to know what is happening on the ground here: an abject failure to administer federal benefits in compliance with current law. 
There is absolutely no possibility that Missouri can handle additional red tape like the “work requirements” in both the House and Senate versions of Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill,” yet Hawley has endorsed them.
Missouri just isn’t capable of enhanced eligibility requirements. A lawsuit brought by disabled Missourians who were denied SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, proves this. 
One plaintiff with cancer and COPD, lacking internet access, transportation — and, let’s not forget, food — used her prepaid cell phone minutes sitting on hold for days trying to get an application. When she gave up and paid for a ride to a benefits office, she got an application but couldn’t complete the required interview due to lack of staff. So she spent more days on hold before having her application denied for failure to complete the interview that she couldn’t get.
That lawsuit was filed when Hawley’s fellow senator from Missouri, Eric Schmitt, was our attorney general. Instead of fixing the problem, the state has defended the lawsuit for three years. 
When the court found that Missouri was not complying with the law, current Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed a non-appealable order that merely requires monthly progress reports on call wait times. In January of this year, the lowest daily average call wait time was 58 minutes and the highest average was 2 hours. The maximum wait time was 5 hours, roughly 21,000 calls were dropped and 14,134 callers gave up (or ran out of cell phone minutes, or had to pick up their kids, or had to go to work, etc). 
On the Medicaid front, Missouri was investigated and offered support by the Biden Administration to deal with our worst in the nation, legally non-compliant wait times for enrollment. 
Individuals submitting their renewal information — online, in person, by fax, or even certified mail — regularly lose their coverage automatically because the state fails to process their documents in time.
A woman who already had coverage through MO HealthNet, Missouri’s Medicaid program, went months without prenatal care because she was unable to reach anyone to tell them she was pregnant.
When the pandemic freeze on Medicaid disenrollments expired, Missouri made a mess of the eligibility review process so families learned at the pediatrician’s office that their children had lost their health insurance despite still being eligible. Children who went without medications for manageable conditions like asthma ended up at emergency rooms. 
Now imagine everyone has to navigate a dysfunctional system every six months to keep their health insurance as both versions of the bill would require. Or even once a month – as the bills would allow. 
You have to take time off work to prove you are working. Or you have to use up time and cell phone minutes to try to prove you can’t work and qualify for an exemption. In a system as broken as Missouri’s, many people can’t jump through those hoops even when they treat it like a full time job.
If Missouri can’t or won’t run it’s SNAP program properly under current law – where the federal government pays all of the benefits and 50% of the cost of administering those food aid dollars that go straight into our local economies – there is no way food insecurity here won’t get significantly worse and our economy won’t take a serious hit with Republicans’ planned cuts.  
Those proposed cuts include states losing at least 5% and up to 25% of their SNAP dollars depending on their “error rate” of under and over payments to households with SNAP.  Missouri’s most recent error rate is 10.2%, which means we would lose 25% of our funding for being over 10%, like the majority of states. And the bill would also cut funding for administrative costs which will inevitably make our error rate worse. SNAP is an optional program, and I wouldn’t put it past our legislature to end it all together and let people starve.
As to Medicaid, instead of allocating the funding needed to run MO HealthNet properly, our legislators blame leadership issues or technology problems. Our legislature has done nothing to prepare for what the proposed Trump cuts would do to us, nor what the DOGE impoundments are already doing. They just keep passing tax cut after tax cut. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Given we are not currently capable of running our Medicaid or SNAP programs, there is no possibility that we can manage added expensive red tape.
But that’s the goal. Republicans know, because it has been widely documented, that work requirements don’t work even in more functional states. They don’t increase employment because people with Medicaid who can work are already working. 
(I am setting aside the larger undiscussed issue of why working full time in the U.S. is not enough to afford health care, unlike in peer nations.)
The idea that there is $880 billion, or even a fraction of that, in “fraud, waste, and abuse,” in Medicaid is ridiculous. The savings Republicans are counting on would come from deliberately making it too burdensome for the struggling people these programs were intended to help to continue using them. 
Look at Arkansas. The state implemented a work requirement and 18,000 people lost their insurance in the few months before a court determined the requirement had been illegally implemented.  
Georgia enacted a program in lieu of Medicaid expansion that requires monthly eligibility paperwork. It has enrolled only 3% of Georgians with qualifying incomes, and the money spent on verifying eligibility has dwarfed that spent on providing actual medical care.  
Republicans are counting on this happening on a much larger scale to offset their tax cuts. It’s an incredibly wasteful and dangerous strategy.  
We burn money on processes to root out non-existent “fraud.” Then, when the people least equipped to navigate those processes can’t do so, they will lose their preventative health care and end up sicker and resorting to more expensive care at hospitals that are required by law to treat them regardless of ability to pay. Then all our premiums go up.
In Missouri, cuts will exacerbate our existing shortage of healthcare providers as more rural hospitals shutter due to lack of funds.

Hawley acknowledged that Missouri’s rural hospitals are in trouble when he opposed a different provision inthe House bill, which would curtail a Republican-created and very popular state tax used to get federal Medicaid dollars to hospitals. (He has since caved on the House’s curtailment, and now only opposes the Senate’s significantly more drastic one.) 
Rural Missourians will have particular difficulty navigating the work requirement due to lacking internet access, transportation, and job opportunities. And you know what makes it harder to keep a job? Losing your health insurance so you can’t manage your health conditions.
Despite there being no universe in which Missouri becomes capable of administering additional eligibility requirements anytime soon, Hawley doesn’t even object to Republicans moving the implementation deadline up from 2029 to next year. This is not a serious proposal for a functioning eligibility process. It’s a plan to take insurance from eligible people on purpose.
When Hawley was asked last week about people “inadvertently losing coverage,” he said: “We can sort that out.” How? If it’s so easy to sort, why didn’t Hawley or Schmitt sort it out when they were state officials or since?
Hawley is portraying himself as an advocate for the people by using the Trumpian tactic of telling us that up is down and a cut is not a cut.

As the executive director of Hyacinth Foundation, New Jersey’s oldest and largest HIV service provider, I am deeply alarmed by the Trump administration’s proposed federal budget for the next fiscal year.
The plan would slash more than $1.5 billion from core HIV prevention and treatment programs — an unprecedented rollback that threatens to unravel decades of bipartisan progress in the fight against HIV. These aren’t abstract numbers. They are direct hits to the infrastructure that helps people stay healthy, stay housed, and stay alive.
Among the most dangerous proposals are the complete elimination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of HIV Prevention (nearly $800 million in funding) and the zeroing out of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS, the only federal housing program specifically serving people living with HIV. These cuts would gut the very programs that keep HIV transmission rates low, provide outreach and education, and ensure that those living with HIV have access to stable housing. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is also under attack, particularly part F, which funds dental care, clinician training centers, and the Minority AIDS Initiative.
These proposals are not just cruel but shortsighted. HIV remains a serious public health issue, with approximately 32,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. In New Jersey alone, more than 39,000 people are living with HIV. At Hyacinth, we serve thousands of them every year across seven cities, including Newark, Trenton, Plainfield, and New Brunswick. The majority of our clients are Black and Latino, LGBTQ+, and low-income — communities that already face systemic barriers to health care and housing. For these New Jerseyans, federal programs are lifelines.
Our state has made real progress. Between 2018 and 2022, HIV incidence in New Jersey dropped by 12%. That progress was not automatic. It was the result of sustained investments in prevention, outreach, and support. It was the result of Medicaid expansion, which now covers nearly half of Americans living with HIV. It was the result of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative and the dedicated community-based organizations that make federal dollars go further through testing, education, case management, and advocacy.
But now, Medicaid has become a target marker and is actively being threatened by proposals to impose work requirements or limit eligibility. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent estimates show that 2.2 million Americans could benefit from PrEP, the daily pill that prevents HIV infection. Yet this budget does nothing to expand access. That’s not just bad health policy — it is fiscally irresponsible. Every prevented infection saves hundreds of thousands of dollars in future treatment costs.
This budget represents a broader pattern of federal disinvestment in public health, and in the HIV community in particular. It turns back the clock on decades of work — work that advocates, health care providers, and people living with HIV have done to demand dignity, equity, and care. Earlier this year, Hyacinth staff joined more than 600 advocates in Washington, D.C., for AIDSWatch 2025. We met with members of Congress to share stories from the frontlines and make clear that our communities cannot afford to go backward.
The Trump administration’s budget proposal sends a dangerous message: that the lives and health of people living with HIV — many of them Black, brown, queer, and poor — are expendable. We know better. We’ve seen what progress looks like when we invest in people’s futures, and we’ve seen the devastating consequences of doing the opposite.
We hope Congress will reaffirm our national commitment to ending the HIV epidemic in New Jersey and across the country.

Maryland's Department of Natural Resources is planning to cut patches of trees along the trail, stirring resistance from local conservationists. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Driving down Route 113 between Snow Hill and Pocomoke City, the trailhead for the Blue Bike Trail is easy to miss.
There aren’t any signs or hiking blazes, but nestled in the woods is a grassy parking area, and the beginning of a 0.7-mile walking trail in the Pocomoke State Forest.
The trail may be short in length and unassuming from the roadside, but a commercial logging plan proposed by Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources has brought the lesser-known trail into the limelight.
The department plans to cut patches of trees from a 45-acre tract beside the trail. But a group of naturalists, birders and other community members are fighting the plan, arguing that the tract represents a rare mature forest on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, with a host of benefits to people and wildlife.
As Joan Maloof, a Berlin-based conservationist who founded the nonprofit Old Growth Forest Network, studied the plan for 2025, the land in Pocomoke State Forest stood out.
“This particular one: It’s 97 years old, and it sounds like it has some big trees, mixed species,” she thought to herself. “I want to go check it out.”
The plot was established in 1927, though DNR says the trees are varying ages. Some were planted after clearing. Some grew naturally. But walking through the forest, Maloof saw something unique.
“I go check it out, and I realize: ‘Oh, my God, this is such a beautiful forest, and it’s right on a recreational trail,’” said Maloof, who is also an emeritus professor of environmental studies and biology at Salisbury University.
Maloof spearheaded an effort to send comments to DNR, pushing for two areas, totaling about 69 acres, to be removed from the logging plan, which designated some 1,700 acres for cutting and thinning.

The state issues logging plans each year for its state forest acreage. And with any cut, the department strives for balance, including between the needs of the ecosystem and the desire to support the local logging industry, said State Forester Anne Hairston-Strang. The department believes the cut in Pocomoke achieves that balance, she said.
“We want to save the bay. We keep a lot of our land rural,” Hairston-Strang said. “Want to keep our land rural? We need a viable rural economy, and so [there’s] this balance between our ecology, the social impacts for jobs and the economic impacts, where we’re using, what the land grows.”
The pushback about the Blue Bike Trail seems to have caught the state’s attention. The area is still on DNR’s list to be logged this year, but the state is slow-walking the cut.
“We’re not rushing into any harvest,” Hairston-Strang said. “We’re going to talk to people. If it needs to go through the work plan process again, it can. We’re not rolling any machines in.”
At the very beginning of the Blue Bike Trail, rows and rows of thin, and therefore relatively unremarkable, loblolly pines dominate the landscape on either side.
But then, the forest transforms into something altogether different. Thicker trees begin to crop up beside the trail: oaks, sassafras, beeches and more.
That’s about where hikers see the first strand of pink tape encircling a tree trunk, delineating the beginning of the proposed logging area.
“I immediately recognized that it was a special tract of forest,” said Bronwyn Betz, a Berlin resident who is also opposed to the cut. “And I know from hiking around here that sometimes that’s not the case. Sometimes you get a lot of pine, and it’s just not as ecologically valuable.”
DNR notes that the Pocomoke State Forest includes several designated “Old Growth Ecosystem Management Areas,” totaling 4,623 acres. In those places, DNR is aiming to nurture the forest and avoid cutting, with the goal of eventually bringing the tracts into “old growth” status. Five additional acres of the state forest are already considered old-growth.
The area proposed for cutting, which DNR calls the “Tarr tract,” is not in either of those designated areas, Hairston-Strang said.
“We don’t want to just provide mature habitat. We have a big commitment to it. We like our old growth. We like our big trees,” Hairston-Strang said. “We’re just looking to provide some of the other end of the age spectrum, too, because we really are seeing habitat declines.”

A goal behind the cut is stimulating the growth of the understory, Hairston-Strang said, growing an additional habitat type in the Pocomoke forest. That’s part of the reason why DNR selected patches of the Tarr tract for cutting.
“If we just select a tree here and there, you’re probably not going to generate the kind of light levels that will really cause that understory response,” she said. “Some people will walk up to this and say, ‘Oh, it’s a clear-cut.’ And they don’t see the careful retention of some individual trees.”
Even if it is not a clear-cut, Maloof argues that the tree removal will do too much harm to the overall ecosystem — and to the public’s enjoyment of it.
“That’s not good enough. We want you to just not. It’s only 45 acres,” Maloof said. “Please listen to the people.”
She fears that DNR ceded too much to the logging industry, which may have sought to log more of the thicker trees, as opposed to the thinner loblolly pines.
DNR argues that it follows best practices for cuts. Maryland State Forests are also certified as sustainably managed through Forest Stewardship Council and Sustainable Forestry Initiative, Hairston-Strang said.
“We pay for people to come out and criticize us every year, and we do both office and field audits, so they’re out in the field and looking at sites,” Hairston-Strang said.
The department is hoping creating clearings in the forest could also attract more deer and turkeys, since the area is a hunting location that allows disabled hunters to shoot from their vehicles using the trail, Hairston-Strang said. And that it will reduce fuel for potential wildfires.
Dave Wilson, an Eastern Shore birder who also serves on Maryland’s Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays, said he’s walked the trail since the 1990s.
“It was always really good for forest interior-dwelling species — songbirds that require large contiguous areas of woods,” said Wilson, who recently sold his 30-year-old birding trip company called Delmarva Birding Weekend.
That includes black-and-white warblers, scarlet tanagers, prothonotary warblers and more, Wilson said. But he’s also spotted other species, such as red-shouldered hawks and Eastern screech owls. He worries that if patches of trees are removed from the area, destroying certain nesting habitats, many of the beloved bird species wouldn’t return.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Wilson said that he considers the Tarr tract one of the few pieces of state-managed land on the Lower Shore that presents a good opportunity for birding.
“Most of what they manage, they just cut every 30 or 40 years for loblolly pine monoculture, and there’s really nothing living in there,” Wilson said. “It’s like a cornfield from a biodiversity standpoint, and there’s thousands of acres of that. And one of the reasons we’re up in arms about this — is because we feel like that needs to change.”
Betz said the Pocomoke State Forest is something of a “hidden gem,” compared to the more well-known Ocean City-adjacent hiking trails, such as those on Assateague Island, which hosts both state park and national park land.
She first visited the trail after it appeared on the logging plan, and quickly decided it was worth fighting for. Bright white mountain laurels bloomed among a diverse array of trees, creating a rare environment.
“I know they say they’re going to selectively cut, but when you have these beautiful mountain laurel shrubs and different things — damage is going to happen to things, no matter what they say,” Betz said.
She brought a group of young 4-H students to the trail, and a few of the students penned letters pushing back against the cut, she said.
“Many of us have grown up camping, hiking and biking in these woods. We do not want this beautiful trail to be logged,” wrote her 15-year-old son, Ewan. “There are many species that will lose their homes if this plan is not stopped.”
Betz said she hopes that DNR will not only opt against cutting along the trail, but put up signage along the roadside, so that the trail gets more use from local residents and visitors alike.
“I had a hard time finding it — and then I had a hard time finding it a second time,” she said.
Betz said she understands the desire to uplift local logging companies and mills. But the trail also has an economic value as-is, thanks to the ecotourism it’s capable of attracting — and already attracts, she said.
“You really can’t put a dollar amount on it,” Betz said. “It actually probably brings in way more money than people would think.”

(Courtesy of the Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles)Yellowstone National Park has over 1,000 miles of trails and nearly 300 designated backcountry campsites, allowing people to venture beyond the main roads and boardwalks. The Yellowstone backcountry includes amazing forests, grasslands, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, thermal areas, and good opportunities to view wildlife.
For those venturing into the backcountry for more than a day, a clean and safe water supply is an important consideration. Water chemists who work in Yellowstone are often asked if the water in the backcountry is safe to drink. Let’s break down three broad water types in Yellowstone so that backcountry hikers and campers can make the best decision when choosing a water source.

Thermal water should not be used as drinking water. First, off-trail travel in thermal areas is prohibited, and the ground in thermal areas is often dangerous to traverse.
In addition, thermal waters can have microorganisms that are known to be harmful, such as Naegleria (a brain-eating amoeba), and can contain elevated concentrations of arsenic and fluoride. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant level for arsenic is 0.010 mg/L, and for fluoride is 4.0 mg/L. The arsenic concentration in Yellowstone thermal waters is often 1 mg/L, but concentrations as high as 17 mg/L have measured — that’s about 2,000 times higher than the maximum contaminant level.
In addition, fluoride as high as 57 mg/L has been measured in Yellowstone thermal waters. Other nasty chemical constituents that are known to be elevated and may cause adverse health effects include antimony and mercury.
So for a lot of reasons, stay away from thermal water. It is not good for your health.
Non-thermal waters from rivers and creeks in Yellowstone are typically derived from snow and rain and are well suited for drinking after onsite treatment. Cool non-thermal waters may contain microorganisms such as E. Coli or parasites such as Giardia that should be removed by filtration or sterilized by chlorination, iodination, or boiling before drinking. There are many miles of non-thermal rivers and creeks in Yellowstone.
But what about discharge from thermal features that flows into pristine rivers and creeks, creating mixed waters?
Chemical investigations indicate that most material contributed by thermal runoff tends to remain dissolved in solution when mixed with river water and is readily transported downstream. Because of dilution, the concentrations of the nasty chemical components, including arsenic and fluoride, are often substantially less than the thermal waters.
But in some cases the concentration of arsenic and fluoride in mixed waters, especially just downstream from thermal areas, can still exceed the maximum contaminant level set by the EPA. Most backpacking filtration systems will readily remove particulates, including microorganisms, but they may not remove chemical components like arsenic and fluoride. Boiling kills microorganisms but would not lower arsenic and fluoride concentrations.
Fortunately, over 140 years of study of water in Yellowstone provide an indication of where mixed waters may be hazardous. As you might expect, it’s mostly in the vicinity of the park’s major geyser basins — especially those along the Firehole and Gibbon rivers.
  This is a Map of Yellowstone National Park lakes, rivers, and streams, with colors indicating the amount of arsenic in the water. The Maximum Contaminant Level defined by the Environmental Protection Agency for arsenic in drinking water is 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L). In the vicinity of major geyser basins, especially on the Firehole and Madison Rivers, arsenic levels far exceed the MCL (orange and purple areas on map). (Map courtesy of the Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles)
In most Yellowstone backcountry areas, there several options for obtaining safe drinking water. When looking to top off your supply, ask yourself “where does the water come from and is there is a thermal area upstream?” Whenever possible, choose a river or stream without thermal waters draining into it.
Enjoy the Yellowstone backcountry, and stay safe!

(Photo courtesy of Fair Share America)Over the next three weeks, a band of advocates in a bright green bus is traveling across the U.S. with a message aimed at members of Congress — and at the voters who live in their districts.
To the voters, the message is that they will be hurt by the Republican mega-bill taking shape in Washington — a bill that would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 that primarily benefit the wealthy and pay for them by slashing Medicaid and other federal programs that critics of the measure argue broadly benefit the public.
To U.S. senators and representatives, the message is: Vote against the measure, or face the wrath of voters in 2026.
The bus trip was launched by  Fair Share America, a coalition of groups focused on  beating back attempts to extend the 2017 tax cuts, one of the signature pieces of legislation from President Donald Trump’s first term. The organization is made up of unions, organizations favoring progressive taxation, and progressive social justice and policy groups.

Fair Share America’s executive director is Kristen Crowell, who lives in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. In 2022 she helped lead a campaign in Massachusetts when voters approved a constitutional amendment that created a 4% surtax on earned income over $1 million.
“That increase is now generating $3 billion annually that is dedicated for education and transportation,” Crowell told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The Boston Globe reported that the campaign to pass the Massachusetts “millionaires’ tax” raised $27 million, nearly twice as much as the $14 million raised by business-backed opponents of the measure. Crowell said the campaign succeeded by appealing to voters on the issue of fairness.
“We know that when we ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more, to pay their fair share, we can fund the investments that our neighbors and families and communities deserve — and really importantly, right now in this moment, they need in order to to get ahead,” Crowell said in an interview.
Opposition group launched in 2024
The 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of this year. With that date on the calendar, Fair Share America launched in September 2024 to oppose renewing them.
“We started organizing before we knew the outcome of the election and were handed a different reality than we might have hoped for,” Crowell said.
Since then, the organization has helped “lead the pushback at the state level to make sure that constituents and the public understand what’s happening behind closed doors in Washington, D.C., and to really bring the fight to key districts and geographies across the country where lawmakers, in particular the GOP members of Congress, have shut out their constituents,” she said.
The bus trip started on Saturday in Peekskill, N.Y., stopped in Philadelphia on Sunday and will hit four more cities across Pennsylvania on Monday. Stops in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Iowa follow. After that, the bus will double back on its route for three Wisconsin stops, in Racine and Oshkosh on Monday, June 30, and La Crosse on July 1.

The schedule will continue through the middle of July, stopping in Minnesota, Missouri, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada before concluding in Bakersfield, California on July 14.
The tour isn’t the start of the organization’s campaign. Fair Share America and its partners with other advocacy groups have been holding town hall meetings in 33 states across the country, Crowell said — including one in Racine in April that featured former Social Security commissioner Martin O’Malley.
Crowell was at the Racine event, to which the local member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville) was invited but didn’t show up. “Over 200 people came [from] across the political spectrum.” Crowell said.
At that town hall and other such events across the country, she’s seen energetic opposition to the new Trump administration as well as the priorities of the current Congress, she said.
“Fair Share America’s not speaking to one side of the aisle vs. the other,” Crowell said. “This is a populist moment.”
Public opposition to budget bill
A poll on behalf of three of the coalition’s member groups found that even before they were given information about details of the GOP budget reconciliation bill, the American voters surveyed had a negative opinion of it.
According to the pollsters 38% of those surveyed said they support the bill, 46% said they oppose it and 16% said they don’t know enough to have an opinion.
Fewer than one-third of voters surveyed — 30% — have heard a lot about the bill. Another 40% have heard “just some” about it, and the remaining 30% said they’ve heard little or nothing about the measure.
The more people heard, however, the less they liked it, according to the report from the polling firm, Hart Research. Opposition increased among all groups after pollsters told people about various details — its changes to Medicaid and to SNAP federal nutrition aid, for example.
“By being in the rooms and town halls and knocking on doors here in Wisconsin, that is what we are hearing and seeing,” Crowell said.
With its slogan, “Stop the billionaire giveaway,” Fair Share America’s bus tour aims to amplify the bill’s cuts to programs that benefit the public and to center the message that its tax cuts favor the wealthy.
Congressional Republicans “have not engaged with their constituents” in Wisconsin and elsewhere about the reconciliation bill, Crowell said. Fair Share America’s goal is to break down the details in terms that people will understand and respond to.
“When you tell them what’s at stake, what’s coming down, they are furious and they want to know how to get in the fight,” Crowell said. “They want to know how to organize their three or four neighbors. So it is incumbent on all of us to shed light on the horrors of this reconciliation bill and do everything it takes to get the word out.”
Funding values and priorities
In Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has said he opposes the bill and has threatened to vote against it, criticizing it for not making deeper federal spending cuts. 
While that’s the opposite of Fair Share America’s agenda, “voting ‘No’ is voting ‘No’ at the end of the day,” Crowell said.
She is skeptical that Johnson will follow through on his threat, however.
“When push comes to shove, I don’t think Sen. Johnson is going to cross the White House or cross GOP leadership. I expect him to fall in line,” she said. “But we’re here to push back and say, ‘Absolutely not. We will hold you to that No vote and we do want you to understand what the stakes are for your constituents.’”
While the campaign’s goal is to stop the bill, there’s a second message regardless of the outcome, Crowell said.
“We are building a movement that is strong and durable and it crosses partisan lines,” she said. “If they in fact do go ahead and pass this, there will be hell to pay for those members who abandoned  and threw their constituents and their communities under the bus.”
Crowell said her more than two decades of activism started when, as a working mother, she opposed Milwaukee public school budget cuts. Her daughter, who was in kindergarten then, is now 29.
She went on to organize with “We Are Wisconsin,” the grass-roots coalition that sprang up in reaction to Act 10 — the 2011 law stripping most collective bargaining rights from most public employees, introduced and signed by Scott Walker in his first term as governor.
Act 10 was billed as a “budget repair bill.” Crowell said that working against it she saw clearly the connection between government budgets and policy.
“If progressives want to really win … and fund the things that we care about, we have to compete for what happens in the budget process,” Crowell said. “We have to compete for a fair and just tax code. We have to compete for the revenue that funds all of the issues that we care about, whether that’s health care or climate or education or child care.”
A budget “can be used either to fund our priorities and reflect our values or attack the things that we deeply care about,” Crowell said. With the federal budget reconciliation bill, “we’re watching the GOP members of Congress do exactly that — looking to further harm our communities through advancing this budget.”

More than $2 billion were wagered last year at gambling establishments in the Equality State. Now, politicians are talking about tax hikes and experts are studying the implications of gambling’s rise.
The post Politicians, experts try to keep up with gambling’s meteoric rise in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","On Tuesday afternoon, 13 horses started their run at a racetrack outside Valparaiso, Chile, hooves pounding the dirt on what in that hemisphere was a 52-degree winter day. 
Some 5,500 miles to the north, a WyoFile reporter making his first bet on a horse race sat within the cool interior of a former diner in Laramie, watching the horses run on television. He hit on a $10 bet on a horse named Viene Puelche, named after a warm Chilean wind. After collecting from the teller, he walked into the heat of the Wyoming summer $6 richer. 
In the grand sums of money changing hands in Wyoming’s horse-race betting industry, the paltry bet was a snowflake in a blizzard. 
In 2024, the total “handle,” or sum of bets placed in the state’s burgeoning horse-based gambling industry, was more than $2.1 billion, according to a report compiled by the Wyoming Legislative Service Office. Each Wyoming adult would have had to bet more than $4,500 that year, if the gambling load was distributed equally and not swelled by tourists. 
And it’s a figure that has ballooned over the last decade. In 2013, the first year machine gambling based on horse races was legalized, the industry’s total handle was just $8.3 million. 
That growth has come with a proliferation of gaming facilities, like the converted diner in Laramie, in most Wyoming towns. And it’s increasingly drawn the attention of state legislators, who after years of letting the industry largely grow under its own momentum, this month decided to draft legislation that would increase its tax burden and strengthen regulatory authority for local government officials, who say they’ve been handicapped in controlling the growth of gambling within city limits. 
Local elected officials around the state are fielding growing complaints from their constituents, Dr. Mark Rinne, the president of Cheyenne’s city council, told WyoFile. His city, in particular, has seen heavy growth of gambling facilities, but Rinne said the Legislature left the city council little ability to weigh in on where they can and can’t be established. 
“We’re the ones getting the grief, but we had no input in the decision,” Rinne said, adding that his constituents have asked, “‘Don’t we have enough of these?’” 
Also lurking beneath the industry’s growth is an uncertain impact on the financial well-being of people and communities. Over two legislative committee meetings this past month, testimony from gaming industry regulators and questions from lawmakers made clear the state does not have a clear grasp on whether problem gambling was sharply on the rise, alongside the proliferation of gaming machines. There was some evidence to believe that it remains low, officials from the gaming commission said.

The state has a program that allows people to ban themselves from online sports betting, or horse-based betting, if they feel they’re out of control. Since that program began in 2021, 20 Wyomingites have exercised that option, Sara Beth Lyon, the Wyoming Gaming Commission’s responsible gaming liaison, told WyoFile. 
But, she said, it’s clear that doesn’t really capture the problem. “It’s not the best metric,” Lyons said, but “it is what we have right now.” The gaming commission is launching a study this summer to both try and assess whether gambling addictions are on the rise, and study the best ways for Wyoming to treat them, she said. 
Another, albeit anecdotal, marker comes from Adelaide Wilson in Buffalo, the head of the Wyoming chapter of the National Council on Problem Gambling. The group is a nonprofit that receives some funding from the industry — mainly through sports betting giant Fanduel — but otherwise seeks money from donors and government programs.
She didn’t have data on how many calls to her office, or Wyoming’s other self-help lines for mental health and addiction issues writ large, have increased, she said. But based on Wilson’s voicemail inbox, it feels like problem gambling in Wyoming is on the rise, she said. 
In the last few days, someone had called to say he’d confessed his damaging gambling habits to his wife and was now looking for help, Wilson told WyoFile on Friday. Another person called to say they’d learned their spouse had lost $40,000 betting over a recent weekend — it wasn’t clear on what — and they didn’t know what to do.
“Those calls are increasing,” she said. “The reality is where there is gambling, there is going to be a problem at some point.” 
Wilson’s group stays neutral on whether gambling should be legal, she said. National studies suggest the majority of people play without developing a problem, and also attribute more problem gambling to the proliferation of online sports betting than machine gaming. 
But one frightening statistic for Wyoming, which has grappled for years with a high suicide rate, is the link between gambling addiction and people taking their lives. Around 7% to 30% of people in treatment for gambling addictions have made suicide attempts, according to the National Institute of Health. “Suicidality … appears to increase alongside the severity of gambling related problems,” the NIH website reads. 
Industry officials say they’re committed to combating gambling addiction in the state. The biggest existing program for raising awareness of resources for problem gamblers, for example, is likely one funded by the Wyoming Lottery, through a portion of its unclaimed prize money.
Live races and slot machines that aren’t 
What’s driving betting’s rocket-like growth trend in Wyoming isn’t live horse races in Chile, or those at three tracks in Wyoming that draw in, alongside gamblers, equine enthusiasts and citizens looking for a fun weekend activity. 
It’s the gambling machines that support those races. 
On Tuesday, the handful of before-noon gamblers inside the converted diner weren’t watching the television screens. Instead, they were seated in front of the glowing, pleasantly chiming screens of what look distinctly like modern-day Las Vegas slot machines. But under Wyoming law, it’s not quite a slot machine. It is, instead, a terminal for placing a bet on a historic horse race.  
That distinction can be difficult to make out. Put money into the machine, press the button, and a reel of images rotates until they align into a winning combination. Just like a slot machine. The result, however, is not random. Instead, it’s dictated by the results of a real horse race run sometime in the past. Gamblers can handicap the games based on anonymized stats about the horses and jockeys, according to industry officials.

On some machines, however, the handicapping option is more complicated than on others. On a machine in Laramie reviewed by a WyoFile reporter, for example, the player had to toggle between screens and evaluate those stats to pick winners for 10 races. He had to do so before a two-minute timer ran out. Far simpler to just hit the button and spin the wheel.  
Of the roughly $2.1 billion handle in 2024, only $6.6 million was bet on live horse races, whether at Wyoming’s tracks or on the races broadcast from tracks around the world, according to the Wyoming Gaming Commission’s annual report. The rest of the money circulated in the 2,939 historic horse racing machines located in 45 off-track betting facilities around the state. As the numbers imply, some of those gambling locations hold large numbers of machines, and inside they look like a small casino floor. Larger facilities can look like a casino from the outside, too, at least according to photographs on the website for the big Horse Palace Swan Ranch facility, near the Colorado border in Laramie County.
“The historic horse racing industry props up and allows live horse racing to exist,” University of Wyoming economics professor Alex Sprecht told WyoFile. “It’s helped bring horse breeders, trainers and others in the industry to Wyoming who may not have come otherwise.”  
In 2018, two Wyoming horse racing companies commissioned an economic impact study that suggested the industry had brought 454 jobs — both direct employment and through economic ripple effects — to the Equality State. 
For decades, there have been three tracks in Wyoming, near Evanston, Rock Springs and Gillette. But for a long time before historic horse racing was legal, those tracks were somewhat listless. There were no races run in 2010, and just four days of racing in both 2011 and 2012, according to the LSO’s memo. With revenues from the gaming machines, race operators have invested in the facilities, increased the prize purses and revved the sport into a much higher gear. 
This summer, the state will see 54 days of live racing, if all go off as scheduled. Energy Downs in Gillette runs races on weekends from mid-May through the end of June. When that track wraps up, Wyoming Downs outside Evanston takes over, running races into mid-August. Sweetwater Downs, outside Rock Springs, then holds races until the end of September. 
Wyoming will soon host a fourth race track. A much-hyped new facility outside Cheyenne, Thunder Plains, is nearing completion. 
The Legislature legalized historic horse racing with the intention of propping up the state’s horse-breeding and racing industry. That’s been successful. The question lawmakers are grappling with now, as local officials begin to raise concerns about machine gambling facilities proliferating rapidly and widely, is how far they should let the industry go. 
“Horse racing is getting better and better, purses are going up, dollars are going up, everything is going up,” Sen. Mike Gierau, a Jackson Democrat, said at the Legislature’s Capital Financing Committee on June 12. “But what also is happening is we’re getting machines everywhere in our communities.”
That committee voted to draft bills that would double the tax on companies collecting online sports bets from Wyomingites, from 10% to 20%. Wyoming’s tax is lower than that of many states today. Separately, the committee also voted to draft a bill to add another 1% tax to the total handle of historic and live horse racing — that $2.1 billion figure. Today, the state collects 1.5% of that handle — while operators are also required to pay another 0.4% into a fund to boost the state’s racehorse breeders. 
Most of that tax goes to local governments, with the money remaining over a certain amount directed into the state’s savings accounts. In 2024, the state pocketed more than $5.2 million. Cities and towns received nearly $10 million and counties a little more than $11 million.  

A screenshot of a map presented to lawmakers by the Wyoming Gaming Commission shows which counties’ voters have legalized “pari-mutuel wagering,” a category of gambling that captures both betting on live horse races and the historic horse racing machines. (screenshot Wyoming Gaming Commission presentation)
Lawmakers on the committee voted to raise the state’s tax rate to 2.5%. A representative for one of the companies behind horse-based gambling’s rise in Wyoming spoke against the measure in the committee, and the industry’s resistance is likely to grow.
Though Wyoming’s Legislature is famously tax-adverse, and perhaps more so now than at any moment in recent memory, increasing taxes on gambling companies could generate interesting discussion, the economist Sprecht said. Many gamblers are likely visitors to the state, he said, though it’s not clear how many. And plenty of Wyomingites aren’t gambling. 
“The tax isn’t going to impact a large portion of Wyoming taxpayers, which is going to make it more politically attractive than a property or sales tax,” Sprecht said. Wyoming lawmakers are doing what state politicians do from time to time, he said — which is to allow an industry to grow with low regulatory and tax burdens, but then squeeze it for revenue once companies have established themselves and made investments. 
“I think the state of Wyoming has been quite generous to the players in this space,” the finance committee’s Senate chairwoman, Cheyenne Republican Tara Nethercott, said before the votes to introduce tax increases. 
Lawmakers on the Select Committee on Capital Finance and Investments discussed earmarking funds from increased taxes on gambling for highway maintenance, as well as substance abuse and mental health treatment — including gambling addiction. 
Who is gambling, and at what cost to themselves?
Because it’s the state’s largest city, or because of its proximity to the Colorado front range, Cheyenne is emerging as a hotbed of gambling’s growth in Wyoming. The capital city’s coffers have benefited from that activity — Cheyenne collected $1.8 million in revenue from historic horse racing in 2023, and Laramie County collected $2.36 million. That year, the county saw around $416 million in betting on historic horse racing, according to a study by the Wyoming Institute of Population Health, a public health division of Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. 
The study sought to get a sense of whether that revenue was coming at a cost to people’s lives and well-being.
The public health study found that gambling is widespread in Laramie County — around 43% of survey respondents said they participate in the growing gaming industry. Researchers did not survey the extent to which problematic gambling was growing or not in Laramie County alongside the number of historic horse racing machines. Instead, they applied national studies on the prevalence of gambling to the county’s population. 
That data suggests around 12% of gamblers are problem gamblers to some degree. The problems are most prevalent among young adults ages 18-29, and online betting is proving more problematic than in-person gambling on machines. 
In Laramie County, such gambling venues were “disproportionately concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods,” the study found. That appears consistent with the socioeconomic realities of problem gambling, the problem-gambling council’s Wilson said. 
Those who can least afford to lose are often those most enraptured by the possibility of winning, she said. For people on the financial edge already, it appears that “if they get that big win, it will solve their problems,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)As tornado warnings popped up across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area during rush hour earlier this month, it became abundantly clear that somebody didn’t know – or didn’t care – that it was smack dab in the middle of tornado season across much of the central and southern United States.
Because why else would federal officials choose a peak period for tornado outbreaks to perform routine and needed maintenance on weather radios?
In case you don’t have one, weather radios live in tens of thousands of Oklahomans’ homes and can be programmed to alert them to imminent severe weather threats. The devices typically are battery operated or have access to backup power, and they are connected to a broadcast network that receives updates directly from the National Weather Service.
My weather radio lives in my bedroom and is programmed to send a piercing alarm whenever there’s a tornado warning in Oklahoma County. The last time it went off, it was the middle of the night and I was sound asleep. It scared the bejesus out of me, but it was my first inkling that an area of circulation had suddenly cropped up and was bearing down on my home, and I needed to move to a safe spot.
In winter months, the radios collect dust, but in a state that sits firmly within Tornado Alley, during the spring and early summer months the radios are lifesavers.
That’s why it was so appalling to learn that at National Weather Service headquarters, who apparently lives in a weather-free bubble, decided that early June was the appropriate time to perform “mandated” computer upgrades affecting the operation of weather radios across large portions of Oklahoma and North Texas. 
To add insult to injury, these updates were scheduled to last three days but wrapped up a day later than planned.
As far as I’m aware, the federal government didn’t disclose until the day before that their planned upgrades would knock a critical lifeline out of commission for four days. The National Weather Service in Norman, which was one of 20 offices across the country affected by the planned outage, serves places like Wichita Falls, Texas, and Stillwater, Ponca City, Enid, Lawton, Ardmore, Chickasha, Altus and Woodward.
And of course, it didn’t take more than a day after the announcement for Murphy’s Law to kick in full force, when Mother Nature decided to unleash holy hell upon us mere mortals.
All four days, we faced a barrage of severe weather. Tornadoes dropped from the sky. Winds whipped. And thunder roared. A June 3 storm dropped two tornadoes and brought severe thunderstorm and flood warnings.
Luckily for us all, that particular day’s severe weather happened in daylight when Oklahomans were awake and alert.
After the first storms, the National Weather Service in Norman said the weather radios seemed to work for the “bulk” of the severe weather, and they didn’t receive any complaints. But I’d be willing to bet that’s because most Oklahomans still didn’t know their weather radios were inoperable. 
The Friday after maintenance was supposed to be completed, someone told me their weather radio didn’t sound a warning. Other people told me they didn’t even know their radio wasn’t operational. Another reached out to ask why officials weren’t making these upgrades in August or November when our state is generally not amid tornado season.
Historically, the first week of June has been dangerous, according to the interesting recaps on the National Weather Service Norman’s website. On June 3, 1993, CD-sized hail fell through the roofs of schools and homes. In Blackwell, over 1,000 windows were destroyed. The storm also caused $70 million in damage to farmers’ wheat crops. 
On June 4, 1973, there were eight recorded tornadoes. On June 5, 1991, thunderstorms dumped up to 7 inches of rain in Osage County, forcing evacuations. And on June 6, 1994, a tornado crossed Interstate 40, overturning cars, tractor-trailers and injuring two motorists.
The fact that nobody died this year due to this abhorrent planning is a miracle.
But this should be a warning for the leaders who apparently make decisions in a vacuum about how important it is to appropriately schedule technology updates and actually examine historical weather trends before making critical decisions like this. 
Because this latest decision doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that people sitting in the National Weather Service’s headquarters in Maryland know what they’re doing or care about the safety of millions of people.
Oklahomans and those living across the central and southern United States deserve peace of mind that they will always have access to warnings that could save their lives.

Jim Pillen remains confident in his preferred policies to grow Nebraska and cut costs, even as the speaker of the Legislature has again identified the state budget as the “biggest challenge” for 2026.
Many of the budget tweaks likely to be pursued in 2026 could respond to changes in federal government funding or state revenue projections, but Pillen said state lawmakers, combined with past policies, will make up the difference.
In a post-session interview with the Nebraska Examiner, he said his cabinet, too, shares his business mentality to improve services while decreasing costs, and he remains committed that state government must be run differently.
“Feel real good about where we sit and that as long as people don’t start thinking there’s money to spend, we’ll be in real good shape,” Pillen said.
Federal changes possible
The state is projected to end the next two fiscal years, beginning July 1 and ending June 30, 2027, with a positive balance of $4.15 million, which includes a built-in spending cushion. That comes after the Legislature approved sweeping nearly $300 million dollars in cash funds or interest from state agencies and $152 million from the state’s rainy day fund to close a more than half-billion-dollar deficit.
The state plans to spend about $5.5 billion a year in general funds over the next two years, which is more than the state expects to collect in tax revenues in either year.

Much of the looming 2026 conversation also could revolve around fiscal projections for the two fiscal years after, those beginning July 1, 2027, and ending June 30, 2029. Current projections show the budget’s structural imbalance growing by the end into a hole of $129.1 million.
Arch encouraged state lawmakers on the last day of the 2025 legislative session to consider budget dynamics ahead of the 2026 session. He suggested watching for possible congressional changes that could shift more costs to the state, and for the next state revenue forecast in October from the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board.
Pillen said he was pleased that President Donald Trump approved a federal disaster declaration for Nebraska’s March blizzard for more than $64 million, while other states were denied. Pillen said if costs for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits or Medicaid are shifted to Nebraska, the state is prepared to find “wasteful” state spending to balance its budget.
He also said that in the case of more SNAP responsibilities falling back on Nebraska, the program would be run more as Nebraska wants the program to be run, not how the federal government wants it.
“We’re prepared if we don’t get more money from the federal government,” Pillen said. “That’s our job. That’s what we have to be ready for.”
Nebraska passes $11 billion two-year budget, closes major projected deficit for now

‘Sleight of hands’
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha has described the two-year budget lawmakers just passed as “based on a number of sleight of hands.” She said it “is not actually balanced. We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”
DeBoer compared the dynamics to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he is wearing extravagant clothing.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, on the other hand, suggested lawmakers should have considered deeper spending reductions and agency cash fund sweeps to prepare for possible federal cuts.
“It’s not about tightening our belt, as it is, we might be having to lop off limbs in order to help pay for our budget,” Hansen said of possible future budget years.
‘Run a government like a business’
Pillen said the state’s “very robust economy” means he won’t “speculate” on the out-year projections, which he noted are based on conservative revenue projections. He said the state’s pro-business policies should result in growth for the state and make a difference.

Fiscal year 2028 is the first year of full implementation of a recent income tax cut for corporations and all Nebraskans making more than $18,000, dropping rates to 3.99%. State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, has described that January 2027 implementation date as a “pinch point” for the state budget.
Pillen said 2029 is “a long way out” — it would be halfway through Pillen’s second term in office if he is reelected in November 2026.
“If you’re talking $129 million in the great big scheme, that’s a really small percentage, I think it’ll be made up,” Pillen said. “If it’s not, obviously, we know how to run a government like a business.

Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge staff will host a native plant station at the event that will enable visitors to learn about the refuge, native plants and how they benefit pollinators, according to a National Park Service press release.

Native plant seeds and planting materials will be available for members of the public to take home and plant in their yards. Visitors will also be able to view interpretive exhibits and learn about the native plants that existed in the area during the Pliocene era three to four million years ago that provided habitat for now-extinct creatures such as the saber-toothed cat, mastodon and ground sloth as well as more familiar animals like horses, beavers and birds, the press release said.

This is the first time that the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, both agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have collaborated to host a public event at Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument.

“We are excited to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help the public understand the importance of native plants in supporting wildlife, today and pre-historically, and how landscapes, plants, and the wildlife they support have changed over time,” said Michael Irving, chief of interpretation and education for national monument, in the press release.

Native plants that grow near the open water and wetlands at the Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge, located about 12 miles northeast of Rupert, draw wildlife species from miles around, including birds such as geese, loons, and herons, and animals such as mule deer, foxes, and bobcats.

“The Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument preserves one of the world’s richest sites for Pliocene-aged fossils,” the press release said. “The fossils found here represent hundreds of species of plants and animals; some are unlike any species living today, while others are the ancestors of species still found in the Hagerman Valley.”

The National Park Service is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the designation of the Hagerman Fauna Site National Natural Landmark, which was designated in May 1975 in recognition of its internationally significant collection of fossils from the Pliocene era.

To commemorate the anniversary, the park service and the Idaho Museum of Natural History are hosting fossil exploration events at the Thousand Springs Visitor Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. July 16 and Aug. 20 and at the Idaho Museum of Natural History, located on the Idaho State University campus at 698 E. Dillon St. in Pocatello, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on July 2 and Aug. 6.

Participants will be able to see and learn about fossils and engage in hands-on activities.

Before traveling to the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument, visitors are encouraged to check current conditions by viewing the park website at https://www.nps.gov/hafo/index or calling the park Visitor Center at 208-933-4105.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Nearly 60,000 businesses, including some of the state’s largest, received more than $1.5 billion in tax rebates from Tennessee — but the list of those companies will only be available on a state website through June 30. 
When lawmakers passed the Republican-backed refund measure in 2024 at the request of Gov. Bill Lee, House members pushed back on senators who wanted no public disclosure of rebate recipients, mandating the information be made publicly available for 30 days. 
“The transparency piece is a really important component of this, particularly in light of the fact that several businesses have extorted us to make this change in a way I didn’t think was good for the public,” said Rep. Ryan Williams, a Cookeville Republican, when the law was being debated. 
Open records advocates have questioned the transparency of the law, but a leading Republican said he’s comfortable with it. 
“I believe in transparency, and so do my fellow Republicans,” said House Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison of Cosby in a June 3 text message.  “That’s exactly why the House made sure the public has easy access to this information.” 
Lawmakers approved the tax refund after officials from the Lee administration said the state faced a potential lawsuit over the legality of its franchise tax, although no lawsuits have been filed against the state. 
Among the businesses getting tax money back are Lee Company, which is owned and operated by Gov. Bill Lee’s family; FedEx; Brown Forman, parent company of Jack Daniels, and AT&T. 
During the 2024 debate of the bill, Lee opposed disclosing businesses receiving rebates, saying “I just don’t think it should be in there. I think we shouldn’t be taking private tax information that the government has, and making it public.”
As part of the legislation, Tennessee published the names for 30 days. The public database doesn’t specify the amount a company is set to receive, but provides ranges that top out at $10,000 and above.
“To say something is above $10,000 is not transparent, because it could be $10,500 or $100,000,” said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government.
The Tennessee Lookout has taken the publicly available info, and republished it below. The database will remain available on the Lookout’s website after it vanishes from the state’s site at the end of this month.

The public database doesn’t specify the amount a company is set to receive, but provides ranges that top out at $10,000 and above. Transparency advocates have called this inadequate.

Officials won’t say which companies benefit from $1.2B tax refund. Property records provide a clue.

Lawmakers approved the tax refund and a $4 billion cut after officials from the Lee administration said that the state faced a potential lawsuit over the way it collected the revenue. No lawsuit was filed. 
State Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican, said he didn’t file for a refund through his funeral services business, but thought the transparency approved was enough. 
“It was the taxpayer’s money to begin with, they sent it to the government, and the government decided they didn’t need it, so they’re giving it back to the taxpayer,” Taylor said. 
 As part of the legislation, Tennessee published the names for 30 days, after which they will disappear. Below is all the information published in a database created by the Lookout.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog group has requested an investigation into a former state staffer’s secret political action committee to determine whether it involved criminal activity.
Registry of Election Finance Chairman Tom Lawless confirmed the agency formally asked the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to reactivate a 2020 request for a probe of Cade Cothren, a former aide to one-time House Speaker Glen Casada, and the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC. The investigation is expected to look at Casada’s possible involvement as well.
Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Election Finance, said he understands the DA’s Office, headed by Stacey Edmonson, is reviewing the request, which was made in a conference call.
Lawless previously told the Lookout that the investigation should commence now that a trial of Casada and Cothren is complete. They were convicted on nearly 20 charges each in connection with a kickback conspiracy scheme. Sentencing is set for Sept. 12 in federal court.
“The actions need to be open to the public because transparency is absolutely essential,” Lawless said.
The registry board subpoenaed Cothren in January 2022 in connection with an investigation into the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC, which was accused of illegal coordination with the campaign of state Rep. Todd Warner in his race against incumbent Republican Rep. Rick Tillis, a political foe of Casada. Warner, whose home and office were raided by FBI agents the same day they hit Casada, Cothren and now-former Rep. Robin Smith in January 2021, defeated Tillis in the 2020 Republican primary. Cothren refused to comply with the subpoena.
​​The registry’s decision to subpoena Cothren, Casada and several other people came after a former girlfriend of Cothren’s testified that she formed the political action committee at his request so he could run it secretly. She said Cothren, whom she thought she loved at the time, also told her to ignore calls from the registry.

June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Two years after a motion-filled and filibuster-riddled 2023 session, Nebraska lawmakers in 2025 settled into a new rhythm as stall tactics again dominated legislative debate.
Throughout the 89-day session that concluded June 2, Nebraska lawmakers filed 347 motions, according to legislative records. It’s the second-highest tally for any session except 2023, when a record 1,160 motions were filed throughout the 88-day session. Similar to that year, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha again filed the most motions.
In 2023, Cavanaugh filed 437 motions (38% of the total filed). In 2025, she filed 80 (23%).

The extent of filibustering also has changed — the procedural effort to extend debate to time limits as set by the speaker of the Legislature. At those limits, 33 votes are required to enact “cloture” to advance legislation, instead of the usual 25.
Since 2023, it has been more routine for legislative opponents to file all three kinds of filibuster motions ahead of debate — to recommit to committee, to bracket (or delay debate) to a set date or indefinitely postpone (or kill a bill). 
Motions to reconsider those motions and various amendments also are common. Introducers have more frequently filed these “kill” motions to their own bills because they get the chance to introduce the motions and speak ahead of opponents trying to stop their proposals from advancing.
A total of 24 measures reached cloture votes in 2025, the second most in a “long” session behind only 2023, which had 58 separate votes held for cloture motions. This year, four bills fell to filibusters, compared to one in 2023.
In 2025, 47 of Nebraska’s 49 lawmakers had a bill reach the governor’s desk, whether on its own or after being folded into various legislative packages, including the budget. The two exceptions: State Sens. Rob Clements of Elmwood and Loren Lippincott of Central City. 
Clements, chair of the Appropriations Committee, played an instrumental role in ushering several budget bills to passage, which ultimately faced no line-item vetoes from Gov. Jim Pillen over a gubernatorial attempt to trim $14.5 million in general fund spending, most of that to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Lippincott also serves on the Appropriations Committee.
The state will end with a final positive budget balance of $4.15 million for the next two fiscal years. Lawmakers started with a projected budget deficit of $432 million in January.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista has already warned senators to pay attention to changing fiscal dynamics, including in Congress, ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 7.



2025 statistics — from 89 days in session

715 bills introduced, an average 15 per senator. An additional 18 constitutional amendments and six policy-based resolutions introduced.


347 motions filed, about one-fourth (23%) from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha (80). State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha followed with 29 motions.


Top bill targeted: LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, seeking to ban most consumable hemp and other tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products (22 motions). The runner-up was LB 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, seeking to weaken voter-approved minimum wage provisions (17 motions).


Top senator targeted: State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha (55 motions). The runner-up was State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse (33 motions).


24 bills were forced to maximum debate limits, or cloture. Four efforts to end debate failed: moving the state’s allocation of presidential electors to winner-take-all (LB 3), reducing the state’s inheritance tax (LB 468), adding property tax relief by expanding sales taxes (LB 170) and providing clearer regulatory guardrails to medical cannabis (LB 677). Two more bills were pulled before they reached maximum debate, because they likely lacked the 33 votes needed to stop a filibuster — one to legalize online sports betting (LR 20CA) and the other to ban most consumable hemp or THC products (LB 316).


204 bills passed — 177 laws and 27 accompanying appropriations bills. Two bills were vetoed.


One constitutional amendment passed — to ask voters in 2026 whether to extend lawmaker term limits to three four-year terms. They can currently serve up to two full terms (LR 19CA).

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A court has ordered the cattle and beef marketing company Agridime to pay $103 million in restitution after operating as a Ponzi scheme that cost North Dakota investors an estimated $40 million.
Meanwhile, a North Dakota-led group seeking to buy the company has missed a court-imposed deadline, making the future of the company unclear. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the federal court order against Texas-based Agridime and its co-founders Joshua Link and Jed Wood on June 16. 
Link was ordered to pay more than $815,000 and Wood to pay nearly $1.5 million. 
The agency says Link and Wood received more than $161 million from over 2,000 customers from 2021 to December 2023 in at least 14 states.
Investors were promised high rates of return by investing in cattle that Agridime would later process and sell as beef products to consumers. 
The company used money from new investors to off previous investors, with a court ruling determining Agridime operated as a Ponzi scheme. 
Agridime attracted cattle investors despite red flags

North Dakota officials last year estimated 149 people in the state, many of them ranchers, were owed about $40 million by Agridime. Some ranchers also were owed money for cattle they delivered to Agridimed but were not paid for. 
The order does not name Taylor Bang, a Killdeer, North Dakota, man who earned more than $6 million in commissions as a sales agent for Agridime, according to the North Dakota Securities Department. 
The Securities Department issued a cease and desist order against Bang in December 2023. That is the same month that the Securities and Exchange Commission took control of Agridime as it investigated its operations. 
The company has continued to operate under the control of a court-appointed receiver as American Grazed Beef, taking online orders for frozen meat products.
A group of investors led by Wylie Bice of Killdeer had a plan to purchase the company and use profits to help repay investors. 
But the investor group failed to close the deal by May 14, a date selected by the judge who approved the sale, according to an update from the receiver on the Agridime website. 
The update said there was “an issue with obtaining funding from the closing of another transaction.”
Bice, who lost money in the Ponzi scheme, did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
A court document shows that the investment group in March had provided $150,000 in earnest money to help keep the company going. The investment group provided more money after missing the sale deadline. 
The May 21 status report concludes that the receiver  anticipates seeking approval from the court in the coming weeks to pursue claims against the purchaser. The receiver also will seek “authority to winddown the operations of American Grazed Beef and sell the remaining assets of Agridime.”

Tom Murphy, a rancher from Killdeer who also lost money investing in Agridime, said Friday he still doesn’t know how much of his losses might be covered by court-ordered repayments. 
“It sounds like we might get like 15 cents on the dollar,” Murphy said. 
Link, one of the Agridime cofounders, in a June 1 Facebook post, disputed that the company operated as a Ponzi scheme and accused the federal government of not allowing the company due process.
He maintained the company was still viable when federal authorities stepped in. 
Murphy said he and many neighbors had stopped receiving payments from Agridime by that time. 
He called Link’s comments “grasping as straws.”

(Photo courtesy of AmeriCorps)Over the last couple of months, funding for AmeriCorps and Vista programs has been drastically cut in Idaho and in the rest of the United States. These funding cuts have an immediate impact on the lives of those individuals who relied on AmeriCorps positions to help pay the bills. Beyond the immediate chaos that this defunding has created, eliminating AmeriCorps and Vista will impoverish our communities in many ways, well into the future.
Terminated AmeriCorps grants by Trump, DOGE totaled $1.9M in Idaho

As part of my role as a medical anthropologist at Idaho State University, I was the director of the Hispanic Health Projects between 2000 and 2009. During that time, we had AmeriCorps funding for dozens of students and community members to work on health-related projects in American Falls, Aberdeen and Pocatello in southern Idaho. Our focus at the Hispanic Health Projects was on using community based, participatory research to create locally appropriate and effective health interventions.
So now, 20 years later, what were the effects of AmeriCorps and Vista on the lives of individuals who participated with us at the HHP? From this perspective, one of the greatest advantages that I can see is that AmeriCorps and Vista positions helped students complete their university degrees at ISU.
The 20 hours a week of work done under these programs was focused on learning about community health issues. It paid some of the bills for the students, and it also gave them experience in working with health care professionals in the communities where they lived. Students going through the Hispanic Health Projects went on to become community members who continue to contribute to southeast Idaho and beyond, every day.
Working in AmeriCorps and Vista gave these students a way to create a vision for improving the health and well-being of their communities.
Students going through the AmeriCorps program are now working as physician assistants, dental hygienists and physical therapy assistants. Some went on for their master’s and Ph.D.’s in various health-related fields like public health and psychology. Some work as health professionals and some are involved in teaching at universities.  Some used their stipends, which were flexible at that time, to fund the education of their children through part of their college experience, thus, helping the next generation to succeed.
These young adults are now making a truly positive impact on their communities. The effects have been long-lasting.
Many of the AmeriCorps/Vista students at the Hispanic Health Projects spoke Spanish as their first language, and many of them had worked in agriculture and related forms of labor before coming to ISU. Other students learned Spanish as they engaged with the Hispanic community members both at the Hispanic Health Projects and in the rural communities around Pocatello.
The learning went the other way, too as those who spoke more Spanish became increasingly proficient in English. We created a bi-cultural atmosphere where all could thrive.
We worked on many topics over the years: diabetes outreach and screening, women’s health checks, school-based programs targeting mental health and teen pregnancy and, also, the very successful Salsa Aerobics program that served many women in American Falls and Aberdeen for years.
Students participating in the Hispanic Health Projects learned to identify local health problems and then to create culturally appropriate interventions that made our communities a healthier place. This work, funded by AmeriCorps and Vista positions made a positive, long-term impact on our rural, agricultural communities.
Cutting these programs is a profound mistake, the funding should be reinstated.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Most of the lawsuits Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has filed against the Trump administration have resulted in court orders pausing or permanently halting certain executive actions implemented by President Donald Trump.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Colorado has joined nearly two dozen lawsuits alongside other Democratic-led states challenging Trump’s actions. So far more than half of those cases have seen judges grant preliminary injunctions requested by Weiser and other attorneys general. That has led to court-mandated reversals of Trump executive actions that sought to change requirements for federal funding, cut federal agencies and their staff, and change citizenship and voter requirements, among other issues. 
“In nearly every case that has had a ruling so far, we’re winning. That’s because these actions are plainly illegal and harmful, and the courts are taking notice,” Weiser said in a statement to Newsline. “One judge, in the case of the president’s clearly unconstitutional order to overturn birthright citizenship, said it was the most unconstitutional action he had seen in 40 years on the bench. More recently, the judge in the case challenging the administration’s termination of certain National Institute of Health grants said he had never seen such palpable racial discrimination.”
While some judges have issued permanent injunctions, others have issued partial or preliminary injunctions as the various lawsuits continue to make their way through the court system.

Other cases are waiting for a judge to issue a ruling while others still need to go through a preliminary injunction hearing.
Here are the court cases that have seen a judge rule partially or fully in favor of plaintiff Democratic states including Colorado.
Birthright citizenship 
Multiple judges, including one overseeing a case Colorado is a party to, have blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. as cases challenging it are resolved. 
Weiser and a coalition of other attorneys general filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Jan. 21 claiming that action violates 14th Amendment and a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The suit seeks to invalidate the executive order and stop any attempts to implement it. 
Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Tariffs
A judge with the U.S. Court of International Trade granted a request from states to permanently block Trump’s move to implement tariffs through four executive orders without approval from Congress. 
The lawsuit asked the court to declare that Trump acted beyond his legal authority and contrary to law when he issued orders implementing tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which does not grant the president the power to impose tariffs. It also asked the court to enjoin federal agencies from maintaining the tariffs. 
“As the court explained, the law does not give the president unbounded power to impose vast tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world,” Weiser said in a statement. “We brought this lawsuit because this was yet another example of the administration acting as though it’s above the law. And this lawless action harmed the State and Coloradans by creating economic chaos and driving up prices at a time when so many are stretching to meet budgets.”
The Federal Reserve projected tariffs Trump has initiated will lead to inflation. 
Public health grants
A Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit Weiser and other Democratic-led states filed challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move to abruptly terminate $11 billion in grant funding, citing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as reason to stop the funding.
Colorado was at risk of losing up to $229 million in grant funding as a result of the cuts that would have affected public health programs such as immunization distribution, training for local public health agencies on infectious disease, lab services and replacing aging lab equipment. 
“I’m pleased the court agreed with me and my fellow state attorneys general that HHS and Secretary Kennedy cannot arbitrarily defund public health and behavioral health programs,” Weiser said in a statement. “If allowed to stand, this inexplicable, illegal action will cause deep harm to Colorado’s ability to deal with challenges ranging from fighting infectious diseases to fighting substance abuse.” 
Freeze on federal funds
The Office of Management and Budget issued a sweeping freeze on all federal funding on Jan. 27. 
Colorado and over 20 other states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island on Jan. 28 arguing the freeze is unlawful. 
Weiser said in a statement that the action violates the separation of powers and is “causing massive harm” in Colorado, affecting health care, education and public safety. 
A Rhode Island judge issued a preliminary injunction in states included in the lawsuit on March 6, and wrote in a 45-page decision that the proposed freeze undermined “the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government.”
A separate preliminary injunction a Washington, D.C., judge entered in late February applies nationwide.

DOGE data privacy
A New York judge extended a temporary order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from accessing Department of Treasury systems. 
Weiser joined a coalition of attorneys general in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to stop DOGE from accessing private taxpayer data. 
The suit followed news that a team of DOGE employees accessed sensitive Department of Treasury data through its payment infrastructure. 
The attorneys general said Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent illegally provided DOGE access to the Department of Treasury’s central payment system and “Americans’ most sensitive personal information, including bank account details and Social Security numbers.”
The lawsuit seeks an injunction prohibiting expanded access to Treasury Department systems as well as a declaration that the administration’s actions were unlawful and unconstitutional.
In a separate case filed by another group of Democratic attorneys general, a judge in Washington, D.C., ordered that a restraining order prohibiting DOGE from accessing federal agency data is not warranted.   
AmeriCorps
A June 5 order from a Maryland judge granted a request from 24 states, including Colorado, to reinstate AmeriCorps grant programs and National Civilian Community Corps members, but declined to reverse the Trump administration’s reduction of the program’s workforce.
AmeriCorps is an independent federal agency that supports community service programs throughout the U.S. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland says the orders to reduce its workforce have effectively ended AmeriCorps’ ability to function, with 85% of its staff on administrative leave. 
“The illegal cuts to AmeriCorps threaten Colorado communities that rely on program volunteers to provide services to military veterans, older Americans aging in place, people dealing with substance abuse, and wildfire mitigation support,” Weiser said in a statement. “As the judge says in the opinion, ‘these volunteers represent the best of us.’ The mass closure of AmeriCorps programs, removal of national service corps members from service, and the termination of federal funding makes no sense.”
Defunding medical research
The National Institutes of Health announced on Feb. 7 it would no longer pay research universities and medical schools a previously negotiated percentage for indirect costs. Weiser and 21 other attorneys general filed suit on Feb. 10 alleging those cuts were unlawful. 
Filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, the suit says the Trump administration’s proposed unilateral 15% reimbursement rate would lead to an inability to facilitate biomedical research. The NIH is the primary source of federal funding for medical research. The attorneys general said the cap violates the Administrative Procedures Act. 
According to a news release from Weiser’s office, the move would cut nearly $90 million in research funding across three university campuses in Colorado. 
A Massachusetts judge granted a preliminary injunction on the funding caps in a 76-page decision on March 5 after she extended a temporary block on Feb. 21.  
The Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of American Universities also filed lawsuits against NIH over the change. 
Gender-affirming care
A federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump order that threatened the funding of any medical institution that provided gender-affirming care to minors, saying it “blatantly discriminated against trans youth.” 
The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington intends to block federal agencies from enforcing the executive order, which also threatens criminal charges against medical providers who provide gender-affirming care. It argues the executive order violates the equal protection guaranteed by the 5th Amendment by singling out transgender individuals for mistreatment and discrimination.
Colorado hospitals that provided gender-affirming care to minors abruptly canceled scheduled appointments for transgender children, citing the order and the potential consequences for their funding.

Federal worker layoffs
A Maryland judge in April ordered the Trump administration to reinstate probationary federal employees across various agencies.
Weiser and a group of 20 attorneys general sued the Trump administration claiming mass layoffs of probationary federal employees are illegal and cause irreparable harm to their states.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland, says the firing of approximately 24,000 probationary government employees who worked for various federal departments violated laws and regulations regarding “reductions in force.” 
U.S. Department of Education
A Massachusetts judge ordered a preliminary injunction to prohibit the Trump administration from dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and must reinstate terminated employees. 
Weiser and 20 other attorneys general filed a lawsuit looking to stop the “effective dismantling” of the government agency that supports students and schools across the country after the department announced it would cut about 50% of its workforce. 
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, says the cuts to the department’s workforce are illegal and unconstitutional, as the department is an executive agency authorized by Congress. 
Colorado received over $1.2 billion from the federal government in 2024 for school programs, according to Weiser’s office. 
Elections executive order
A Massachusetts judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent certain provisions of Trump’s March elections executive order from being implemented.
The order requires proof of citizenship to register to vote and vote, requires all ballots be counted on Election Day, and threatens federal funding for states that don’t comply, among other changes. 
The Constitution grants states the right to oversee their own elections, with Congress permitted to regulate certain aspects of voting. 
Voting rights advocates and the Democratic National Committee have filed separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump’s order, too.
Dismantling federal agencies
A May order from a Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction to prohibit DOGE from dismantling certain federal agencies. 
Weiser and 20 other Democratic attorneys general filed a suit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island challenging a Trump order attempting to dismantle federal agencies created by Congress. 
While Trump has taken several actions attempting to cut down other federal agencies, the lawsuit is focused on the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The order Trump issued on March 14 orders the agencies “to eliminate every one of their programs and components not mandated by statute.” 
Other case updates
While a Massachusetts judge granted a temporary restraining order reversing the U.S. Department of Education’s move to freeze $600 million in grant funding for K-12 teacher training programs, the Supreme Court issued an administrative stay to allow the freeze to continue as the case continues.
The judge who issued the restraining order said he saw “no reasoned explanation articulated” for the program terminations. The freeze threatens $2.8 million for a program that prepares teachers to work in rural Colorado communities that have a hard time hiring and retaining teachers. 
Federal funding for the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development grant programs goes to state universities and other teacher training programs around the country. On Feb. 7, the department immediately terminated the distribution of these grants, which were approved by Congress. 
In a lawsuit Colorado joined that argues the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze wind energy development harms states’ efforts to diversify affordable, renewable energy sources, a Massachusetts judge ruled that the case can continue after the administration tried to get it dismissed.  
A judge also issued a preliminary injunction from the bench in a lawsuit joined by Colorado that claims the National Institutes of Health has purposely delayed the review process for medical research grants that should have already been issued. A written order granting the injunction should be issued soon, according to Weiser’s office.
The agency has refused to pay for multi-year grants that were approved under previous administrations since Trump took office, citing disagreements over race and gender issues. Research institutions received letters alerting them that their grants were canceled in relation to “DEI,” “transgender issues” or “vaccine hesitancy.” 
In a case joined by Colorado challenging the U.S. Department of Transportation’s move to require immigration enforcement as a condition for a state to receive funding, a Rhode Island judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the requirement. The lawsuit says attaching immigration enforcement as a condition to receive federal funding is beyond the federal government’s authority and is unconstitutional.

(Mike Chalmers for West Virginia Watch)Derek Gallagher, a teacher at Martinsburg High School in Martinsburg, West Virginia, isn’t one to sugarcoat hard truths. He just wrapped up his 15th year at MHS — covering psychology, AP psych, sociology, contemporary studies and leadership. And within minutes of meeting him, you realize he is anything but a traditional educator. Which is exactly how he prefers it. 

Originally from Pittsburgh, Gallagher arrived in the Eastern Panhandle to play basketball at Shepherd University — where he started from 2006-2010 — ultimately graduating with a degree in education. He also earned a master’s in curriculum and instruction from Shepherd while teaching at MHS after graduating. 
“When I first started teaching, it was a very traditional classroom: desks, chairs, chapter reviews, tests, notes, worksheets — the whole package,” he said. “I think I brought good energy, but that was all I knew. I thought that’s what worked — because that’s what I was told worked.” 
But a few years into teaching — and while pursuing his master’s — Gallagher started running into former students. He’d ask them about his courses, the material, the lessons. The answers often comprised vague memories, scattered impressions, no real retention.
“It really gave me pause,” he said. “These were good students — smart kids. But they couldn’t remember the core concepts. And I just thought, what are we doing in education if this is the result?”
It was a question he kept circling back to. He began looking more closely at what schools actually demanded of students. “They sit. They take notes. They regurgitate information. There’s not a ton of critical thinking — it’s mostly about finding the ‘right’ answer.”
Quoting philosopher and education reformer John Dewey — “You learn what you do” — he saw how disconnected the average classroom was from that principle. “We’re not doing. We’re pretending,” he said.
Around Gallagher’s fourth year, things began to shift. He enrolled in a course at Shepherd on the brain-body connection. The concept resonated deeply, especially with Gallagher’s background in athletics. Short bursts of high-intensity movement, he learned, weren’t just good for the body — they primed the brain for learning.
“They trigger the release of BDNF — brain-derived neurotrophic factor,” he said. “It’s basically Miracle-Gro for the brain.”
Even while still teaching in a traditional way, Gallagher began experimenting — adding in five-minute movement breaks before vocabulary lessons. For his master’s thesis, he tracked student performance. The results were clear: the group that engaged in high-intensity movement consistently outperformed the control group. 
“They remembered more. They engaged more. It was night and day.”
But Gallagher didn’t stop at movement. He started to examine everything — food, attention spans, addiction pathways, the pervasive glow of screens.
“We’re feeding these kids garbage — sugar bombs for breakfast, processed carbs throughout the day — and then asking them to sit still and pay attention. And on top of that, we give them screens and pretend it’s innovation.”
He cited a recent report showing how teens now average nearly nine hours a day on screens, with nearly zero regulation or structure around that time. 
“We’re not teaching kids to regulate dopamine — we’re helping them spike it all day long. And then we wonder why they’re anxious, distracted and disengaged.”
For Gallagher, it wasn’t enough to diagnose the problem. He wanted to rebuild the model entirely.
Quiet rebellion 
He started with subtle changes in the way he structured his classroom, built in movement, experimented with nontraditional methods. But the real catalyst, he said, was COVID.
“That’s when I saw the full dysfunction of the system. We were throwing a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. ‘Wear a mask. Stay six feet apart.’ But no one was talking about immune systems — about kids being vitamin D deficient, never moving, eating garbage and not sleeping.”
For Gallagher, the pandemic laid bare what had already been broken. 
“So I asked myself: What can I control?” He started holding class outside whenever possible. “That alone was a lightbulb moment — why do we have to be in a building to learn?”
What followed was a quiet but deliberate rebellion against the traditional classroom. Gallagher began rethinking not just what he was teaching, but how, where and why. He removed the rows of desks, opened the blinds to let in natural light, and turned off the fluorescents. “The modern classroom doesn’t have to be the default. Frankly, we’re not getting connection.  We’re just getting compliance.” 

He also credits a rare stroke of fortune: an administration open to new ideas. “That’s not always the case,” he said. “If I’d been in a different county or a different state, this might’ve gone nowhere. Which would be extremely unfortunate because kids are really struggling today.”  
And it’s not because kids are broken, he affirmed. “It’s a natural response to the environment we’ve created. We can’t keep teaching like it’s 1992 — or even 2005. Everything about their world is different now. We’ve got to teach like we know that.”

 Shift in consciousness

A decade and a half since he arrived at Martinsburg High, two things at this point ring undeniably unique about Gallagher’s approach to education: the garden and the workouts.  
Just beyond the edge of an ancient MHS tennis court, a once-forgotten patch of land has been transformed into something quietly radical: a living, breathing classroom. It’s part garden, part training ground, part sanctuary — and for Gallagher, it represents everything the modern education system has forgotten.
“We’re obsessed with convenience and immediacy,” he said. “And in some ways, that’s fine. But it also robs us of something deeply human — the process.”
The garden, he explained, is the perfect antidote to that mindset. A student drops a seed into the soil, and over time — with care, water, weeding and patience — it becomes food. But more than that, it becomes a mirror. “Learning is a process. Fitness is a process. Growth — literal or figurative — is a process,” he said. “And when you grow food, you’re participating in something ancient. You’re connected to the earth. You’re taking care of something outside yourself.”
He points out that gardening isn’t just about nutrition or sustainability — it’s also about healing. “For kids battling anxiety or depression, it’s incredibly grounding. You’re not fixated on your own stress. You’re thinking, ‘What does this plant need?’”
Every class Gallagher teaches spends time in the garden. If the weather holds (winter notwithstanding), they’re outside. Lessons are delivered from picnic tables or folding chairs, sometimes scribbled in chalk across the tennis court. A whiteboard lives in the garden shed. The outdoor space is as functional as any indoor classroom — and intentionally more alive.
The results aren’t measured in harvest volume. “We’re not growing enough to feed the community,” he said. “We’re growing enough to think differently about food. At the end of the day, if you care about kids, you have to care about what we’re feeding them — body and mind.”
It’s a shift in consciousness he’s after. “When students pull Swiss chard from the earth and take it home to cook, or sauté radishes in a pan right there in the classroom, something changes,” he said. He describes students crowding around fig trees and tomato plants like “a swarm of locusts,” devouring produce on the spot. “It’s immediate. It’s real. And it sticks with them.”
But the deeper lesson, he said, is about reverence. Gallagher borrows from Abraham Maslow’s idea of “resacralizing” the everyday — making food sacred again. “In every major spiritual tradition — Buddhism, Islam, Christianity — food is sacred,” he said. “There’s a sense of gratitude and presence that’s supposed to come with eating.”
Over the past few years, the garden has evolved from a passion project to a full-fledged school asset. Gallagher and his students have secured more than $12,000 in grant funding to expand the space. What began as a modest plot has grown into an interdisciplinary zone for both nourishment and movement — a space utilized by an additional 10 teachers at MHS. 
“We built it out as a true learning space,” he said. “And it wasn’t just me. Multiple teachers here have taken part — especially Mr. Cook, our Agriculture teacher. He’s been an enormous contributor to the cause. They all understand that it’s not just about food — it’s identity work. It’s recovery. It’s building purpose in young people.”
And while many school garden programs fade away after their first season, Gallagher’s continues to grow. “Because it’s not performative,” he said. “It’s part of the rhythm of what we do.”
As a result, the momentum has been steady. And the support has followed. What began with four raised beds and a grant from the Eastern Panhandle Conservation District has grown into a fully realized outdoor learning space supported by local organizations like Freedom’s Run and the Martinsburg Rotary Club, as well as larger national organizations like CrossFit. Gallagher estimates the garden and its extensions have brought in nearly $30,000 in funding to date.

Soon, the land surrounding the site will boast a fitness trail. The “Les Smith Fitness Trail,” named in honor of a beloved teacher and coach who passed away in 2022, will wind its way through the outskirts of the school property. 
“It’s for the students, but also the community,” Gallagher said. “We don’t have a public fitness trail in Berkeley County. This could change the landscape — literally and figuratively.”
  Once a month, students from any of Derek Gallagher’s classes have the option of participating in his Movement, Awareness, Adaptation initiative — which involves a physical fitness regimen that often pushes them to their limits. (Derek Gallagher | Courtesy photo)
The whole human
The workouts began with a simple idea: five minutes of movement could be one of the most effective uses of instructional time.
“Short bursts of physical activity trigger neurological engagement,” Gallagher said. “Students come back sharper, more focused, more connected — not just mentally, but socially and emotionally. It builds community.”
That premise evolved into a larger initiative he now calls MAA — Movement, Awareness, Adaptation. Once a month, his classroom becomes a training ground for something far beyond physical fitness. These aren’t typical gym sessions. They’re tests of effort, will and reflection. And they’re entirely voluntary.
“But the wild thing is,” he said, “even students who don’t participate physically still walk away with something. They see their classmates push through these brutal workouts — see them struggle, adapt, overcome. And afterward, they’ll say, ‘That taught me more than any PowerPoint ever could.’ That’s real learning. That’s peripheral learning — the stuff that sticks without you even realizing it.”
The MAA sessions are open to all of Gallagher’s classes. On those days, the garden transforms again. Community members might even drop in to participate. And Gallagher himself joins, moving with his students, sweating alongside them.
“When they see me doing it, it shifts something. I’m not just preaching effort — I’m modeling it. They see that this isn’t about PE or punishment. It’s about the whole human being.”
While the workouts might look like a detour from traditional instruction — especially to an outsider peeking in on a day when the entire period is dedicated to movement — Gallagher insists that’s part of the problem. 
“We’ve boxed in our idea of what counts as learning. If it’s not a worksheet or a note-taking session, we assume it doesn’t ‘count.’ But real education isn’t always measurable in real time. That’s why this model works — it meets students where they are. It teaches them to rise.”

Expanding the vision 
Fifteen years into his career, Gallagher now finds himself in a position he wouldn’t have anticipated when it began: public facing. In multiple appearances before the Berkeley County Board of Education, he has laid out a case that is as data-driven as it is impassioned: the school system is failing its students — not just academically, but physically, emotionally and socially.
“West Virginia has long ranked near the bottom nationally in categories like obesity, childhood diabetes, physical inactivity and access to fresh food,” he said. 
According to the CDC’s State of Childhood Obesity, nearly 37% of children ages 10–17 in West Virginia are overweight or obese — nearly quadruple what it was just 25 years ago. Gallagher doesn’t need statistics to recognize the problem. 
“We have this data, and yet the food schools serve remains laden with sugar and processed carbohydrates,” he said. “A typical breakfast can contain as much as 64 grams of added sugar, with donuts, chocolate milk, juice and flavored yogurt all considered ‘in compliance.’ We are essentially fueling the problem.”
While districts spend millions on iPads and Chromebooks, he said, there is little to no investment being made in initiatives that encourage physical activity, outdoor learning or in-person connection.
In contrast, he added, a growing body of research points to the benefits of movement and time spent outside, “… both of which can reduce anxiety and depression while improving cognitive function.” 
Among his proposals: eliminate juice and chocolate milk from school menus, educate teachers on simple movement-based interventions to use in class, invest in outdoor classrooms and gardens, and establish a standing health and wellness advisory board to help guide district policy based on current health data and real-world outcomes.
Most notably, Gallagher developed a dual-enrollment course with longtime wellness advocate Dr. Al Bacchus titled Love, Wellness, Happiness, and the Self-Examined Life. The class would offer students three college credits through Blue Ridge Community and Technical College in Martinsburg and include longitudinal tracking to assess the long-term impact on participants’ health and well-being. Despite being approved by the college, the course was denied by the BCBOE.
“If we’re not pursuing research-based health and wellness programs in schools, then what are we doing?” Gallagher asked. “We have to stop spending millions on tech while ignoring the actual bodies and minds of our students. Their future physical, emotional, psychological and economic well-being depends on the decisions we make right now.”
When asked about the future, Gallagher doesn’t talk about retirement or accolades. He talks about legacy.
“I hope when I’m done teaching, I can hand this thing off to someone else who will carry it forward,” he said. “This is going to take decades. But if we keep fighting, if we stay focused on quality of life, I believe we’ll look back at some point and say we really changed something.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A downtown Nashville honky tonk employee filed suit against the Neo-Nazi Goyim Defense League and more than a dozen of its members, after he was assaulted and subjected to racial slurs during the hate-group’s 10-day “intimidation tour” of the city in July. 
Deago Buck, who is of mixed race, was employed at Johnny Cash’s Bar and BBQ when he was beaten, gouged in the eyes and struck by the pole of a swastika flag, in an attack on a public sidewalk the hate group livestreamed.
Buck’s assault was not an isolated incident during the group’s time in Nashville. 
Members of the group assaulted a Jewish man, heckled young Black children, disrupted a Metro Council meeting and accosted numerous passersby while chanting “Sieg Heil,” “f— the Jews” and “white f— power” while throwing Nazi salutes, instances that were widely reported in local news media at the time
Brought by attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the suit alleges the group violated the federal Ku Klux Klan Act and accuses it of acts of battery, assault and harassment. 
The federal lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Middle District of Tennessee, seeks a ruling the group violated Buck’s rights and an injunction blocking the group from future violations.

Blumberg Institute and the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center (PABC), one of the country’s primary biotech incubators.","The home of the Hepatitis B Foundation, the Baruch S.

Three Pennsylvania nonprofits share a uniquely focused mission on public health. Looming federal cuts to scientific research, they warn, could unravel decades of their work.  
While the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts in biomedical research are  reverberating nationally, they are also causing grave concern in Bucks County, home to the Hepatitis B Foundation, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute and the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center (PABC), one of the country’s primary biotech incubators.
Leaders at the Doylestown-based organizations said sweeping spending cuts across multiple federal agencies threaten not only jobs and research, but advances in public health across the world.
“The drastic, arbitrary cut in National Institutes of Health (NIH) indirect cost funding would eliminate billions of dollars that support medical and public health research projects nationwide,” said Chari A. Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation.
 “We are the only nonprofit solely dedicated to finding a cure for hepatitis B and improving the lives of those affected worldwide,” she said.  Loss of the funding,  “would result in thousands of jobs being cut and we stand to lose an entire generation of the world’s best and brightest scientists,” she added. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Recognizing the statewide importance of the biotechnology industry, Gov. Josh Shapiro visited in February, designating $30 million to support the incubator. Scientists from around the world lease lab space for their research at the Bucks site. More than 100 small- to midsize research and pharmaceutical companies are PABC members.
Louis P. Kassa III, chief executive officer of the trio of institutions, said work done at the center has contributed $7.3 billion to the state’s economy over the past five years.
State lawmakers from both parties have also provided smaller grants over the years. “Pennsylvania has prioritized infectious disease elimination,” Cohen said. 
However, it’s federal money that’s the backbone of the southeastern Pennsylvania nonprofits, the executives said.
The numbers are stark. The Blumberg Institute currently holds 11 research grants and a multi-year contract with the NIH, which together provide salaries and benefits for 28 scientists and 10 support staff. If the funding is reduced or eliminated, the institute and the Hepatitis B Foundation could lose approximately $7.5 million in 2025 alone, said institute officials.
Additionally, the facilities are awaiting decisions on $10.2 million in pending NIH research grant proposals. That money supports research on the pathology of hepatitis B, clinical trials, liver cancer, and other related diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,797 people in the U.S. died from hepatitis B in 2022. 
Cohen described the proposed funding changes as “deeply alarming.” She noted that the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis, based in Atlanta, has already been shuttered. “That division supported national surveillance and could track hepatitis A, B and C epidemics. It was the only one of its kind in the world,” she said. 
 “In my life, I never thought I’d see this,” said Cohen.

Beyond the funding cuts, the Trump administration is proposing sweeping changes to the structure of the nation’s public health apparatus. A significant revision involves replacing parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with a new entity. The Administration for a Healthy America would fall under the oversight of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The new agency would absorb several existing federal programs, including those addressing substance abuse, HIV prevention and mental health, while also slashing budgets and workforce sizes, the CDC reported.
“The Budget reflects needed reforms to put health care spending on a sustainable fiscal path and proposes policies to Make America Healthy Again,” HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote in a statement to CBS News earlier this month.
According to the  agency’s data, the administration is proposing a $4.3 billion (or 53%) cut to the CDC’s budget and a 43% reduction in staffing. Trump officials argue the CDC has “exceeded its role” and should be refocused on “core functions.” 
Global initiatives to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria could end under the new policies and millions of dollars in NIH grants, including those long expected by southeastern Pennsylvania’s three nonprofits, would be eliminated. 
“The decision to terminate certain grants is part of a deliberate effort to ensure taxpayer dollars prioritize high-impact, urgent science,” Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, told ProPublica.
“Many discontinued projects were duplicative or misaligned with NIH’s core mission. NIH remains focused on supporting rigorous biomedical research that delivers real results — not radical ideology,” said Nixon.
Dr. Ju-Tao Guo, acting president and chief scientific officer of the Blumberg Institute, said loss of  federal financial support would harm important parts of his team’s work, which supplement the Hepatitis B Foundation’s research.
“What’s happening at the NIH is being called an effort to eliminate waste, but reimbursement of research facilities and administrative costs have always been closely monitored by federal officials,” said Ju-Tao Guo. “These costs support critical activities like patient safety, hazardous waste disposal, and research security.”
Cohen shared those concerns, calling the staffing and program reductions “deeply alarming.”
Adding to the uncertainty is a change in how federal funds will be distributed. The administration’s proposed 2026 budget eliminates $43 billion previously approved by Congress for hepatitis B prevention and replaces it with a $300 million block grant to states. That funding, according to the spending plan, would also have to cover tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infection prevention.
As Congress prepares to debate funding for the proposed new health agency and overall public health spending, scientists, nonprofits and research advocates across the country are pushing back. 
“These actions will impact our work here and abroad and profoundly impair our country’s ability to save lives and achieve the national goal of eliminating hepatitis B as a public health threat,” said Cohen.
 “It feels like an attack on innovation, on science,” said Kassa.

He poses in his Frankfort office, June 13, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Dr. Steven Stack says Kentucky, which already struggles with poor health, is “on the cusp of having a significant backslide” if the federal government cuts programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Stack, who on July 1 will shift roles from the state’s public health commissioner to the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said Kentucky can become a healthier state over time, but that requires robust safety net programs. 
The “profound cuts” proposed to Medicaid by Republicans in Congress, he said, would push vulnerable people from “the edge of despair … into despair.” 
He’s also concerned that science is becoming less trusted and prioritized as the Trump administration cuts funding for research and widespread vaccine hesitancy has led to drops in childhood immunizations. 
In his new role, Stack will oversee a state agency that employs about 8,000 people and wields a multi-billion dollar budget. The cabinet manages Kentucky’s human services, which includes Medicaid, foster care, care for the aging, assistance for those with disabilities and more. 
Stack will bring to the secretary position a 20-year medical career, according to his official state biography. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Stack has been an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee Haslam College of Business, served on the American Medical Association (AMA) board of trustees and worked as the medical director for St. Joseph East in Lexington, St. Joseph in Mt. Sterling and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis. 
Stack is replacing Eric Friedlander, who is retiring. Dr. John Langefeld will replace Stack as the public health commissioner. 
Ahead of his transition, Stack sat down with the Kentucky Lantern in his Frankfort office for a 40-minute conversation about lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, the politics of health, the direction the United States is heading — and what that could mean for Kentucky’s health infrastructure — and more. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Kentucky Lantern: Let’s start with the pandemic. What did you learn during COVID that you’re going to take into this new role?
Dr. Steven Stack: One of the things that I was grateful for was my background as an ER doc. In the emergency department, you have to make fast paced decisions in an information-poor environment, and you have to live with the consequences. I think that described COVID to a tee. We did that on a weekly, if not a daily, basis. We made high stakes decisions, and we had to do the best we could, and you had to communicate clearly what you were doing and why, and you had to own the consequences of those decisions. 
I don’t think it was the first time I learned the lesson, but I think that it made it very clear: Leadership is a privilege and an honor.  The other thing is: You learn that leadership can be lonely and it extracts a price, and so whenever you have to make decisions, there are some people who like the decisions and there are other people who don’t. 
COVID, being a once in a century pandemic, was of a scale and a magnitude that obviously changed all of our lives for an extended period of time, and I think gave me a much deeper, much richer appreciation for both the opportunity and the burden of leadership and the responsibility that is attendant to it.
KL: How did you avoid burnout? 
SS: I’m not sure I fully did. Burnout has a number of different elements, at least as I understand it. One is, did I avoid physical exhaustion? No, I didn’t. 
It was the first job I’ve ever had that was so hard for such an intensive period or a prolonged period of time that that caused me health impact. And so I don’t think I avoided the physical exhaustion; that facet of burnout, but I don’t think I got emotionally burnt out, and I don’t think I got mentally burnt out. 
It was important work in a time of crisis, and there was a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of people who were in need of someone to at least message clearly and reassuringly that while it would be difficult, we would get through it.

KL: What did you do for your mental health — then and also now — to help with this stress? 
SS: When I’m doing my best, I get up early in the morning, and I like to read books. I read history books to provide perspective. I do that because, in any moment in time, there are crises. 
Yesterday was full of multiple crises: a large jumbo jet crashing with one survivor, a new escalation in Middle East tensions. There’s certainly controversy related to protests occurring and the use of the federal government using state resources to play a role in that. So there are always crises.
I find it helps to read history a little bit and put in context that there have been crises before. There have been plenty of existential moments where the leaders of the time and the people felt ‘we’re at the precipice. It’s not clear that we won’t go over the precipice.’ 
That’s one of the things I tried to do during COVID, was to acknowledge the difficulty of the time. I had confidence during COVID we would get through it, and we would get through it together, just like the governor said, because that’s what has always happened in history. But getting through it didn’t mean that there wouldn’t be people lost along the way, and there wouldn’t be traumas and sorrows to accept and deal with.

KL: Health has become more and more political. We saw it during the COVID-19 lockdowns and when the vaccines came out. We’re seeing it now. How do we remove politics from health? Or — should we? 
SS: Everything’s politics. Politics is negotiating with your 3-year-old at home, whether they’re going to use the potty or not. Or it is negotiating with your teenager whether they can have access to the car or not to go out for the weekend. 
Politics determines our food sources. It determines what gets approved or supported for the foods we buy at the grocery store or how farmers are or are not supported. It certainly impacts the medications that we have access to or not. 
In the current situation, it raises real concerns about our politics reaching the point where science is taking a back seat to prove people’s personal preferences. I think that that’s very dangerous because while we’re always going to have different perspectives on different topics, it’s really essential that we try to adhere to some kind of structured approach, and ideally a transparent approach, to how decisions are made. 
Right now, we have a real challenge, because there’s an intense blurring of a magnitude we really haven’t experienced in recent years of science versus preference and beliefs. I am concerned that if we don’t find a way to kind of back that down a bit, that the public won’t have access to the very best choices, the very best options that they could have.
KL:  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. just fired the vaccine advisory board and has promoted information that’s not backed by science since taking over as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary. As you enter this new role, how can you lead with science if the federal guidelines aren’t based on science? 
SS: It gets difficult because we have long relied on federal institutions to be the aggregator across the states. 
There’s only one entity in the United States that can approve new pharmaceuticals. It’s the Food and Drug Administration. No state has the authority to approve a new pharmaceutical for marketing.
As a nation, we’ve got to find a way to lower the temperature on some of these things, and we also have to remind ourselves that a big part of our democracy is that we support all persons to have their opinion and to have their voice, and that while the majority gets the opportunity to make the decisions, there’s always an obligation to ensure the minority’s voice can be heard, can be safely expressed, and can have the opportunity to be persuasive, which requires the majority to be open to persuasion. Right now, we really don’t have that.

KL: These controversies aren’t just at the federal level. What about your cabinet’s relationship with the legislature? How will you approach the conversations around kinship care and foster kids sleeping in offices, for example? 
SS: I intend to do what I’ve done, I hope, up to this point: to be candid, to be honest, to be forthright about what I understand to be occurring and what I recommend should occur. 
Anyone who gets elected to a position has to be able to show to the people who elected them that they are advocating for and fighting for what those people want. So what happens at a legislative hearing — people need to look past the intensity of the moment and the words that are said. 
Even in these hyper political times, there is a lot of collaborative work that gets done behind the scenes, because, believe it or not, even if the legislature doesn’t like what the executive branch does, the legislature needs the executive branch to implement the things it wants to be done. So, if they create circumstances where it becomes impossible for the executive branch to actually do their work, it doesn’t just mean that the other party’s work doesn’t get done. It means that their work doesn’t get done. 
At the end of the day, government needs to come together in some form or fashion to make sure that the things that the legislature wants done have an executive branch resourced properly and capable of doing those things. It doesn’t always happen that way.
KL: Zooming out for a second, Kentucky has high rates of opioid use disorder, cancer — so many issues. Is it possible for Kentucky to ever be a healthy state? And if so, how could we get there?
SS: I think it’s possible for Kentucky to be a healthier state. 
There’s a ranking system — America’s Health Rankings — that comes out every year. Over the last five to seven years, Kentucky has gone from 47th to 41st. I give a lot of credit to the intentional expansion of Medicaid and the running of the state-based (health insurance) exchange, because while health insurance does not guarantee health — they’re not the same thing — not having access to health care causes people to live sicker and die younger. 
We have other headwinds that are really challenging. Kentucky is one of the poorest states in the United States. We have areas that face particularly difficult challenges. So the Appalachian region has a number of challenges. They have the loss of the coal industry, which increased unemployment and decreased employment opportunities. With these floods that have happened with climate change, they’ve been devastated multiple times because they don’t live in a flat area. They live in an area where you build in the valley, because that’s the only place there’s flat land. But then when the water comes, it floods out everywhere you are. 
KY still pays price for one of nation’s highest rates of opioid use disorder, says new report

Addiction is often a consequence, a disease of despair and a disease of despondency. And so when people don’t have jobs and they struggle to support themselves, they look for an outlet, and so often those drugs become part of that outlet. We have to address those fundamental things. 
In this administration, the governor frequently talks about economic development and talks about bringing in new employers. The way we get people off Medicaid, the way we get people to be more self sufficient and more resilient, not entirely, but in a large part is: Do we have well paying jobs where people can go earn a good living and then bring health insurance with it, so that they can have access to health care and support themselves and have productive lives? If we don’t focus on creating communities that are livable with job opportunities that bring health insurance with them, it’s very, very difficult.
Right now, there are profound cuts proposed to the SNAP program, significant cuts in different ways for the Medicaid program. Those things are going to take the most vulnerable among us and take them from being at the edge of despair, and thrust them into despair. 
I’m very concerned that the path we appear to be on is going to take a state like Kentucky that relies very heavily on those services and supports and thrust a large portion of Kentuckians into a very, very difficult and stressful position, which is going to be a massive headwind against improving our health outcomes.

KL: To close us out, what are your main goals for your tenure as cabinet secretary? 
SS: When I step in on July 1, I’m going to have two years and five months (until the end of the Beshear administration), pretty much, and it’s going to be during a time of major federal retraction in the support that it provides.
My goals are to support the governor’s initiatives, to try to make sure that, through the end of this administration, we continue to deliver on his commitments to the people of Kentucky.
My goal would be to support the people of Kentucky, to make sure they have the best that we can provide them with the resources available, to make sure they don’t go hungry, to make sure their kids show up ready for school. So (Beshear has) a push now for pre-K. It’s really, really important in those early years that children are resourced properly, that they don’t go to school hungry, and that they have access to structured environments that can educate and help form them and set them on a good path. 
A big part of my task is, how can I lead the team here, the team that I inherit, to perform at the very highest possible level, so that whatever the resources we have, we maximize those to the greatest good for as many people as we can serve. If we lose a lot of federal dollars, the reality is we won’t be able to provide the same amount of services. That’s the truth. 
If the federal government ships major costs to the state, the legislature is going to have some really hard choices. If the elected representatives of the United States House and Senate decide to cut money from the state, their counterparts at the statehouse are then going to be left with the decision: What do we pay for and what don’t we and what services will the people of Kentucky not get? 
In this case, the legislative branch, both federally and state, will ultimately be the ones who make those decisions and own the consequences. They have difficult choices to make, but those choices will have real consequences.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island now trails behind every other New England state in the latest national ranking of children’s wellbeing after sliding from 12th place to 19th.
The Ocean State had outpaced Maine in overall rankings last year in the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s annual KIDS COUNT Data Book, which looks at economic, educational, health, and family/community indicators. In the 2025 edition released June 9, Maine also dropped in the rankings but not as much as Rhode Island. Maine fell from 15th place in 2024 to 17th place.
New England states performed well overall: New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts placed first, second and third in the national rankings, respectively. Connecticut placed eighth nationally.
Rhode Island’s score was the result of dips in both economic wellbeing and health, according to a statement from Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, the local branch of the national nonprofit policy, advocacy and data organization. In the 2025 report’s national rankings, Rhode Island fell from 9th to 24th in economic wellbeing and from 6th to 16th in health.
“We know what kids need to grow up healthy and connected so they can thrive as adults: Stable homes, financially secure families, strong schools, nutritious food, meaningful relationships and opportunities to learn, play and grow,” Paige Parks, Rhode Island KIDS COUNT executive director, said in the statement after the report’s release.
The 2025 report largely relies on 2023 federal data, with multiyear averages used to refine some smaller datasets. 
But the national data suggests many Rhode Island families continue to face financial insecurity. Two categories dented the Ocean State’s economic wellbeing score significantly. It placed 36th nationally in the share of children in households where no parent has full-time year-round employment. It also placed 36th for its percentage of families spending more than 30% of their income on housing.  
Rhode Island fared better in the percentage of children living in poverty — defined as below $30,900 for a family of four — and placed 14th nationally.
The state maintained low rates of uninsured children, rising from 2% to 3%. Low birth weight held steady at 7.3% of live births. Rhode Island’s child and teen death rates rose from 15 to 23 per 100,000. The national rate for child and teen deaths also rose from 25 to 29 per 100,000, although each New England state recorded similar increases in 2023.
Approximately 33% of Rhode Island youth were diagnosed as overweight or obese in 2023, which placed the state 35th nationally.
Academic performance metrics
Educational outcomes remain the state’s weakest area overall, even as the state improved by moving from 29th to 28th nationally.
The state had 67% of fourth graders reading below grade level — only three percentage points worse than New Hampshire. Meanwhile, 74% of eighth graders were below grade level in math. 
Rhode Island placed 37th nationally, however, for the number of high school students not graduating on time, at 17%. 
Rhode Island did improve slightly in family and community metrics, rising four spots to 16th place in 2025. All four metrics improved at least incrementally from last year, with the highest-ranking place a fourth place slot for teen birth rates, at seven births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19. 
In her statement, Parks highlighted the urgency of investing in programs that support children’s long-term success. 
“Programs that meet these needs are smart investments, fostering long-term gains like employment and economic growth,” Parks wrote. “Investing in kids isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s a smart, future-focused strategy that benefits the whole state.” 
Some of the legislative priorities Rhode Island KIDS COUNT has backed in the soon-to-conclude legislative session include strengthening the RI Works Program, establishing baby bonds for newborns in RI Works, and expanding maternal and child mental health supports like MomsPRN and PediPRN.
A state profile for Rhode Island is available on the Annie E. Casey Foundation website, as is the full 2025 Data Book.

(Google Maps)Even though Colorado is ostensibly a “blue” state, many supporters of the Colorado charter school industry are solidly on board with President Donald Trump’s agenda for public education. Trump is aligned with the billionaire oligarchy and Colorado’s charter school growth has been funded by billionaires and corporate interests. The state’s charter school expansion is also fueled by ideological goals from arch-conservative groups closely allied with the Trump administration.
On Nov. 21, 2024, a Denver Public Schools board member described how “oligarchs created the conditions to expand charter schools in Black and Latino communities across Denver,” where almost one-fourth of the district’s’ students now attend charter schools. Thanks to the monetary influence of these billionaires in local and state elections, Colorado has one of the nation’s most favorable charter school laws and the second highest percentage of students in charter schools. 
Trump’s federal education budget to expand charter schools is being increased by $60 million to a record half a billion dollars. Trump’s executive order on school choice drew high praise from national pro-charter leaders like Fred Hess and Darryl Bradford, whose 50 CAN organization sponsors Denver’s Transform Education Now, an organization that backed the expansion of Colorado charter schools for decades. A recent proposal by Gov. Jared Polis and state Senate President James Coleman to increase more charter schools is also in accordance with this Trump priority.

Linda McMahon, Trump’s billionaire secretary of education, is promoting new conservative priorities on how schools deliver their education, and these goals are in vogue in many Colorado charter schools. The criteria for expanding charter schools places an emphasis on “patriotic and classical education.” This priority is directly associated with reports that “right-wing Christians are taking over the Charter school industry.”
In their exhaustive study “A Sharp Turn Right,” the Network for Public Education authors describe how charter classical schools signal “the creation of a new breed of charter schools that are imbued with the ideas of right-wing Christian nationalism.” The NPE report explains how “classical charter schools emphasize ‘values’ or ‘virtues,’ which stand as shorthand for quoted scripture. This is especially true of the latest crop of classical charters, which have opened since 2017, the first school year during the Trump Administration.” 
The NPE report identifies several Colorado classical charter schools and asserts that classical “schools have become weapons of the right as they seek to destroy democratically governed public schools while turning back the clock of education and social progress by a century.” Professor Derek Black describes this focus on patriotic and classical education as “labels through which conservatives have counteracted woke education (with) their own extreme right version of history & hero worship.”
According to data from the Colorado Department of Education, more than a third of Colorado’s 264 charter schools use “classical” or “core knowledge” curriculum, which coincides with Trump’s focus on both patriotic education and values-based education. The Classical Academy charter school in Colorado Springs highlights their essential mission to “nourish the soul” in their educational philosophy. Liberty Common school’s philosophy in Fort Collins describes how that school celebrates “capstones” representing the “highest order of virtue and character,” including “prudence, temperance, and patriotism.” Ridgeview Classical schools believe “that an American exceptionalism exists and is worthy of examination and reverence, and that through a proper understanding of one’s country, genuine patriotism is both possible and admirable.” 
The four Colorado Ascent Classical Academy schools and Golden View Classical Academy are part of the Hillsdale College K-12 education system, whose K-12 school program director Eric Coykendall, worked for the Claremont Institute, an organization that has backed Trump since 2016. At the Ascent Classical Academy of Northern Colorado school commencement in May, Bradley Birzer from Hillsdale College invoked both Christian virtues and the seven virtues taught at the school, stating it is “the virtues—through God’s grace—that keep us on the straight and narrow path of morality, dignity, and freedom.”
E.D. Hirsch, the founder of Core Knowledge, published articles decrying the country’s slide into an anti-nationalist mindset that has taken over the public schools. “My thesis,” writes Hirsch, “is that our young people’s low opinion of their own country has been intensified by the current disrepute of nationalism in any form in our schools and universities. This anti-nationalism has been a big mistake.”
Hirsch says the role of schools should be to foster “the right kind of nationalism.” The core knowledge curriculum is used in nearly 60 Colorado charter schools. 
Not all of Colorado’s charter schools adhere to Trump’s calls for patriotism, classical education, and conservative ideology connected to Christian values. However, the number that do align with this vision will soon increase. On June 17, even with vocal opposition from members of the community, the state-appointed members of the Charter School Institute authorized the approval of a new “classical” charter school, John Adams Academy, in Douglas County. This school will be part of the John Adams Academies charter network in California. Their board includes a chaplain, and its founder, Dean Forman, cites a culture of debauchery in public schools, prioritizes Christian beliefs in his blog and focuses on virtues and patriotism as central elements in his three California charter schools. 
Will Colorado charter schools, the Charter School Institute, and state legislators continue to align with the Trump vision for public education? It remains to be seen how widespread the impact of the new Trump education priorities will have on Colorado’s K-12 education system.

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

– Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland


In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When it comes to vaccines, there are two kinds of parents coming into Dr. Megan Prior’s office in Washington, D.C., these days.
One set are parents who pepper the pediatrician with increasingly panicked questions about the future availability of vaccines and whether their children can get any shots early. Then there are the parents who feel vindicated in their decision not to vaccinate their kids, despite vaccines’ overall safety and record of disease prevention.
“It’s almost like I have these two groups of diverging patients, where some are really, really worried about their access and want to get things done as soon as possible,” she said. “And then others are sort of in this vaccine hesitant category.”
Both groups have been spurred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy’s HHS shakeups could have huge implications for vaccine policy in America. Earlier this month, he fired all 17 members of a key vaccine panel and replaced them with a smaller group of people who in some cases lack relevant experience and who, like him, have been skeptical of vaccines. He claims the vaccine panel firings were aimed at addressing members’ conflicts of interest, even though they worked under a comprehensive policy.
Physicians who treat both children and families say they’re frustrated with Kennedy’s unprecedented firing of the panel known as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and they’re concerned about what it might mean for the future availability of safe and effective vaccines.
For now, doctors are figuring out as a medical community how they can keep their patients healthy with evidence-based guidelines. They’re turning to each other — through membership in trusted organizations that are taking joint actions — and figuring out how to give patients reliable information amid uncertainty about the government’s next steps.
ACIP’s review of vaccines and subsequent guidance, under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helps insurance companies determine vaccine coverage. A change to ACIP recommendations could have the ripple effect of making a vaccine more expensive to obtain, or more difficult to access through doctors’ offices and pharmacies. The new panel has not taken any actions yet, but its members are scheduled to this week. Vaccine experts say they’re watching closely to see what policy changes, if any, might emerge.
“If I were a mom, and I’m thinking, ‘What do I do for my kid right now?’ I want to be confident that my primary care physician, my family doctor or my pediatrician was making recommendations based on what we know from science and not based on what the insurance company will or will not pay for, or what politics is saying,” said Dr. Jen Brull, a longtime family physician who is now president of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). “I think it’s very safe to say that you can look to your primary care physician for that kind of recommendation, and that’s what you should be looking for.”
Prior, who has long used ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines to answer questions from parents, said she recently downloaded a version of the current children’s vaccination schedule that includes recommendations made by the fired vaccine panel, “just in case there are any changes, so I can remember exactly how wording looked.” She is creating a list of trusted sources, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and AAFP, so she can monitor how they mirror or pivot from future government actions.
Other vaccine experts have announced their own initiative to protect the integrity of vaccine policy, information and access.
“Clearly, there’s a lot of us who are super interested in evidence-based science that will ensure that physicians and families have access to the right recommendations, no matter how politicized things get,” Prior said.
Around the same time that news about Kennedy’s ACIP firings broke, hundreds of doctors were gathered in Chicago for a key meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest association of physicians, representing more than 190 state and specialty medical societies. Within hours after the firings were public, Brull and representatives from several major medical groups drafted an emergency resolution that called on Kennedy to reverse his actions on the vaccine panel and also requested a Senate investigation into the firings. The resolution passed.
“The emotion in the room was that everyone who was there cared about this — but we wanted to make sure that the AMA, that our individual organizations, were speaking truth,” Brull said.
Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and spokesperson for AAP, said the recent dismantling of expertise on ACIP threatens a clarity that has developed over decades within the medical community when it comes to vaccinations.
AAP has been issuing vaccine guidance since 1935, nearly three decades before ACIP was created. To help reduce confusion, both entities officially began publishing harmonized guidance on vaccines in 1995. The consistency helped streamline care for families and reduced discrepancies as combination vaccines became more widely available, according to Higgins.
AAP still maintains its own expert review process for its vaccine schedule, and Higgins said the organization plans to keep issuing recommendations that are “grounded in science and committed to child health.” He worries about potentially conflicting recommendations in the future, and how that might raise public confusion and distrust.
“Parents we talk with are understandably anxious and unsure,” he said in an email. “Our parents and families have a lot of questions, and as pediatricians, we welcome those questions. Pediatricians want to partner with parents and meet them where they are with compassion, clarity, and credible information.”
Brull also wanted to emphasize that point from the lens of family physicians, who sometimes see generations of one family and can be a key source of evidence-based medical information, especially in rural areas with more limited health coverage options.
“My foundational advice to parents and kids who are old enough to have these conversations on their own is that the best thing most people can do is reach out and talk to their primary care doctor — whether that’s their pediatrician or their family physician, and have a conversation,” she said.
Prior, who shares her views on health policy news on social media, does not want to minimize the implications of ACIP’s new membership and what it could mean if they pull a safe vaccine from the immunization schedules for adults or children. She still distinctly remembers her constant worry about whether her young child could access a COVID-19 vaccine, and the transition to in-person schooling and re-entering more public spaces.
“If we live in a world where measles is incredibly common, where whooping cough is incredibly common, where these really infectious diseases are just part of our lives again, parents will have to go through those decisions again,” she said. “I think that piece of it makes me so frustrated.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
[Editor’s note: North Carolina would join the list of most permissive states if Republican legislators were to override Gov. Josh Stein’s recent veto of Senate Bill 50 — a measure that would allow anyone 18 or older to carry a loaded concealed handgun without any permitting requirement.] 
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Every day across Kentucky, thousands of students fail to show up for school. Some miss a few days a month. Others are absent for weeks at a time. When the final tallies are made, many will have missed more than 10% of the school year.
This pattern, known as chronic absenteeism, is quietly eroding the futures of our children — and we cannot afford to ignore it.
Across the United States, over 8 million students are chronically absent each year. In districts serving our most vulnerable populations, that number is even higher. And while many still think of absenteeism as a discipline issue or a matter of personal responsibility, I see something else entirely.
As a family court judge, I’ve learned that chronic absenteeism is often the first visible sign that something much deeper is wrong in a child’s life. It may be illness, untreated trauma, housing insecurity or caregiving burdens at home. It may be depression, anxiety or a simple lack of transportation.
These are not just educational challenges — they are public health concerns.
That’s why we need to reframe how we think about absenteeism. When we treat it like a public health crisis — because that’s exactly what it is — we open the door to early intervention, stronger support systems, and meaningful, long-term solutions.
Far too often, students who are chronically absent fall behind academically and never catch up. This disconnect from school can lead to disengagement from peers, lower self-esteem, and in many cases, contact with the juvenile justice system. When children drop out, the consequences extend far beyond the classroom — they echo through our economy, our public safety systems and our communities for generations.
And we must recognize that this crisis is not hitting all children equally. Chronic absenteeism disproportionately affects Black, Latino, Indigenous, low-income and disabled students. These disparities are rooted in inequities in health care access, housing, nutrition and neighborhood safety. If we are serious about addressing absenteeism, we must be equally serious about addressing the systems that allow those inequities to persist.
The good news? We can change this.
School-based health centers, mobile mental health units, trauma-informed classrooms and strong family engagement strategies have all proven effective. Judicial diversion programs that prioritize rehabilitation over punishment can break cycles before they begin. Community-based partnerships can ensure students are surrounded by the support they need — not just to get to school, but to thrive while they’re there.
But to make real progress, we must stop treating absenteeism as someone else’s problem. It belongs to all of us. Schools alone cannot fix it. A solution will require action by public health officials, judges, educators, faith leaders and families alike.
We must ask different questions. Instead of “Why isn’t this child in school?” we need to ask, “What’s happening in this child’s life that’s keeping them from showing up?” That shift — from blame to understanding — can change everything.
I’ve seen what happens when we wait too long. But I’ve also seen what’s possible when we act early — with compassion, coordination and commitment. Every child deserves a chance to be present, to be supported, and to succeed. Let’s not wait until they’re in my courtroom to figure that out.

It stayed on overhead from 6:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night. Which was a surprise for the 34-year-old New Hampshire resident because he always thought of prison as a dark place, like in the 1999 movie “The Green Mile.” His cell wasn’t fully dark at night either. Guards with flashlights regularly checked on everyone held at the Wyatt Detention Facility.
Schmidt was housed among other Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees apart from the larger inmate population held by the U.S. Marshals Service awaiting federal court proceedings. Yet he learned other ICE detainees faced serious charges, including murder, sexual assault, and drug-dealing. The mission of the Wyatt — a quasi-public maximum security facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island’s smallest city — is to “protect the public from people who pose a threat to society.”
Schmidt never committed any violent crime.
Instead, he got off a plane at Boston’s Logan International Airport on March 7 on his return from a 10-day trip to visit family and friends in his native Germany. Schmidt obtained his green card as a teenager and became a U.S. permanent resident. But for some reason, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents pulled him aside.
They aggressively asked him about past misdemeanors from 10 years ago when he lived in California — including a charge of drug possession that had been adjudicated. They asked about his annual income, where his parents lived, and what they did for a living.
He was held for hours, which turned into days during which he was denied the chance to speak with a lawyer, his family, or the German Consulate. At one point, Schmidt said he was strip-searched and thrown into a cold shower. He was given only a thin mat to sleep on and fed a cold cup of noodles. He collapsed after developing flu-like symptoms and was transported to Mass General Hospital, where he was handcuffed to the bed.
After being discharged from the hospital, Schmidt was taken back to the airport. On March 11, four days after his return from Europe, CBP agents came to get him.
“That’s the first time I went to Rhode Island,” he recalled in a recent interview at a coffee shop near his home in Nashua. “In hand shackles, feet shackles, in the back of an SUV going like 80 miles an hour.”
He speaks softly, with a faint accent, sometimes pausing to note the surreal facts of the 58 days he spent inside the Wyatt.
In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Rhode Island Current, “When an individual is found with drug related charges and tries to re-enter the country, officers will take proper action. In this case, the conviction was dismissed, and the individual was released.”
In several posts on the platform X , McLaughlin has called clips from news reports on Schmidt’s treatment by CBP at Logan “blatantly false,” “straight-up false,” and “flat-out FALSE.”
Schmidt is readjusting to life back home. He said the ordeal cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, lost wages from his job as a master electrician, and expenses for food, clothing, and phone calls home to his worried girlfriend. He is considering filing a lawsuit, though he doesn’t have details to share about that yet.
“This whole experience feels like a movie,” he said.

Not knowing why
Schmidt’s story is one of dozens of accounts of hyper-aggressive immigration enforcement since the start of Donald Trump’s second term. There’s the Canadian woman with a U.S. work visa detained by ICE for two weeks who wrote she felt like she had been “kidnapped;” the visiting scholar at Georgetown University with an academic visa held without charges at an ICE detention facility in Texas; the pair of Georgia newlyweds separated after the bride, an asylum seeker from Colombia, was detained by ICE.
According to the Syracuse University-based public records database, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), 19,125 people were booked into ICE detention in March, when Schmidt was first detained. His case drew headlines because it initially made no sense.
New Hampshire’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan described the case as “very concerning,” while Massachusetts Democratic State Rep. Mike Connolly called Schmidt’s detention “outrageous” and “unlawful.” On X, a Canadian law professor’s post about Schmidt was shared more than 2,000 times.
His case also highlighted the Wyatt’s role at the center of a yearslong political firestorm. Several public officials, including Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa, previously the mayor of Central Falls, have called for its closure. State lawmakers have introduced bills to close it down or, in the case of active bills in the House and Senate sessions, to stop ICE’s ability to do business with Wyatt for civil immigration violations. Community members regularly hold protests outside the Wyatt’s walls to draw attention to people detained inside. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been at least six such rallies.
One, on March 18, was for Schmidt. Outside the Wyatt, people chanted his name and held signs that read “FREE FABIAN” and “DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.”
Schmidt heard them from inside. It gave him a surge of adrenaline. And a realization.
“Whoa,” he recalled thinking at the time. “This is bigger than myself.”
Schmidt spent his childhood traveling with his mother and stepfather, who worked as a tech consultant. He has lived in Denmark, South Africa, and England; he can read and write in four languages. When he was 16, his stepfather’s work brought the family to Palo Alto, California. His stepfather’s visa was for people with extraordinary abilities in their field — often called a “genius visa” — and granted Schmidt legal entry as a dependent. Schmidt rode horses, played football, and embraced his new home.
In 2022, he moved to Nashua to be closer to his mother, who had moved there. After a stint as a bartender, he found work as an electrical project lead at two affiliated companies: Greenerd Press & Machine Co., in Nashua, and Diamond Casting, in Hollis.
Ian Wilson, a process engineer at Diamond Casting, called Schmidt a crucial member of the company. “He’s upstanding, friendly, gregarious, and very energetic,” he said.

While bartending, Schmidt met and fell in love with Bhavani Hodgkins, who is now his fiancée. (Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother in California.) He and Hodgkins have a black Lab named Django.
“This is where I’m from,” he said. “I love this country.”
Low-quality food, high fees
The Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility opened in 1993 on the site of a former textile factory. At the time, it helped address a shortage in pre-trial federal jail space in New England. During the search for a suitable Rhode Island site, a few cities and towns opposed the facility. But long-struggling Central Falls saw an economic opportunity.
Shortly after the facility opened, then-Mayor Thomas Lazieh called the Wyatt “a win now and a much bigger win down the road.”
The ensuing years brought some payments from the detention center to the city; Central Falls received a total of $5.3 million in impact fees from Wyatt from 1994 through 2008, according to a 2012 joint legislative commission.
But Wyatt also brought escapes, lawsuits over detainee mistreatment, criminal charges against staff members and wardens, a receivership, and — most notably — the 2008 death of an ICE detainee involving medical neglect and mistreatment.
The death of that detainee, Hiu Lui “Jason” Ng, prompted ICE to withdraw from the Wyatt for a decade. In 2019, the agency returned, amid an outcry from community groups, the Rhode Island ACLU, and elected officials.
Today, the facility boasts a capacity of up to 730 adult male and 40 adult female detainees. According to a report in late March, the facility held 617 detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service (590 male, 27 female), and 116 detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (112 male, 4 female). One of those male ICE detainees was Schmidt.
He was housed in 10-by-7-foot cells with thick, pneumatically locking steel doors. One cell looked out over Macomber Stadium, where Central Falls High School plays athletics.

The food was so bad, he said, he wouldn’t feed it to his dog. Breakfast was some kind of “oversalted…flour soup,” Schmidt said, along with a pinkish sausage of unknown origin, a dry piece of cornbread, and a serving of lukewarm milk. Lunch and dinner consisted of food that came from a can — chicken, green beans — and powdered potatoes that tasted like cardboard.
Schmidt’s account of the food provided at the Wyatt echoes a March report by the community organization Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), which states, “In the first two weeks of March, AMOR received messages from 16 people detained by ICE who specified that they would not have enough to eat without help purchasing food from the Commissary.”
Schmidt was scared, sad, and depressed during his weeks at the Wyatt. He missed his daughter, his partner, his dog.
“Mentally, you have to learn how to block that out in prison or else you’ll ruin yourself,” he said. “You have to be able to be like, ‘OK, I’m not gonna miss my dog today.’”
In April, Hodgkins shared a note Schmidt wrote in a Facebook post: “Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.”
After Schmidt was moved to the Wyatt, Hodgkins spent hours on the phone — with him, his family members, attorneys and others — trying to strategize how to secure his release and ensure his safety and comfort until then. She was forced to navigate the substantial financial burden of having a loved one detained at Wyatt.
To supplement the Wyatt’s food options, Schmidt needed to purchase food items from the commissary. He needed money to buy more toothpaste and soap because supplies issued to detainees didn’t last very long. Hodgkins created accounts so Schmidt could receive packages and communicate with her, via phone or video-chat.
“Every single thing that you do at the Wyatt Detention Facility requires (a) form of payment,” she said.
A receipt Hodgkins shared on Facebook shows, between March 12 and May 6, she spent more than $2,600 in deposits into the facility’s TouchPay system — deposits requiring fees ranging from around 6% of a deposit to more than 40%. In one instance, she was charged a $4.30 fee for a $10 deposit. The total fees, across 25 deposits, add up to more than $220. 
  A record of deposits Bhavani Hodgkins made into Fabian Schmidt’s commissary account shows the fees she paid during the 58 days he was held at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls. (Screenshot)​​
Here, again, Hodgkins’ experiences aligned with conditions described in AMOR’s report, which says Wyatt contractors charge “exorbitant” rates for basic services, including phone calls, text messages, and food to supplement insufficient nutrition.
“In the first two weeks of March, 20 people detained reported to AMOR that calls were too expensive,” the report’s authors write. “During the same period, 43 individuals made new requests for Commissary help.”
As she navigated these new challenges, Hodgkins said she was dealing with waves of her own anger, anguish, and sadness. She was fearful for Fabian’s health and safety, that he would be deported, that they would lose the life they had built together.
Hodgkins rearranged her work schedule so she could make the 80-mile drive from Nashua to Central Falls in time to meet the facility’s strict rules that visitors arrive at least 30 minutes before visiting hours. During one visit, she saw an elderly woman with a walker turned away for arriving too late.
Hodgkins found the facility intimidating: a massive concrete building with small windows surrounded by tall razor wire fences. The “visits” were, in fact, a phone conversation with Schmidt while the two were separated by glass in a room lit by fluorescent lights. Once, when she washed her hands inside the facility, she noticed the water had a yellowish tinge.
“I really hope that no one has to go there to see their loved ones, because it’s truly horrible,” she said.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When Rhode Island Current reached out to the Wyatt with detailed questions about the conditions both Hodgkins and Schmidt described, a spokesperson responded: “The Wyatt has no comment at this time.”
No problem with international travel in 2017
When protesters assembled outside the Wyatt on March 18 to call for Schmidt’s release, his lawyer, David Keller, said Schmidt’s past issues in California had been resolved and there hadn’t been any new official charges pressed against his client.
“Imagine yourself being charged with a crime, held, and not even knowing what the crime is,” he told reporters. “That’s essentially his situation.” (Keller was unavailable to comment for this story.)
About a week later, Schmidt finally learned the reason for his detention: a misdemeanor charge for drug possession from California that had already been resolved. Schmidt had pleaded no contest to the charge in 2015, despite disputing that the drugs were his; he was unaware that the controlled-substance conviction marked him in the immigration system as inadmissible. He said he was never notified of these implications of a no-contest plea, nor had he been stopped by CBP after an earlier international trip in 2017.
Once the immigration charges against Schmidt became clear, lawyers for Schmidt on both coasts swung into action. In California, a criminal attorney re-opened the drug case and was able to get it dismissed from the system. (Grounds for that dismissal: the substance Schmidt was charged with possessing had never been tested to confirm what it was.) In Boston, his immigration attorney worked to secure a hearing with an immigration judge.
The hearing finally happened on May 8. The judge dismissed Schmidt’s immigration case in minutes.










Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.


– Note from Schmidt posted by Bhavani Hodgkins on Facebook


Schmidt and Hodgkins finally reunited outside of ICE’s Boston field office in Burlington, Massachusetts. The days since then have been joyful. Shortly after his release, Schmidt proposed to Hodgkins. He has enjoyed regular walks with his dog, cooking dinner with Hodgkins and reconnecting with friends.
But the couple’s life together is much different from the way it used to be. Schmidt estimates his time in custody cost him at least $65,000, between legal fees, lost wages, and the many costs of his Wyatt detention. An online fundraiser by his mother raised over $34,000. A second fundraiser launched by Hodgkins “to help aid other legal immigrants with injustice” is ongoing.
The emotional toll has also been steep. In the early days after his release, he couldn’t take a nap while home alone, afraid people might come for him while he was sleeping. Routine activities like a trip to the grocery store can now trigger waves of panic. He is wary about driving, fearful of being pulled over and detained again over a minor infraction.
“I have to be strong when he’s not, and I can’t show my fear as much because I don’t want him to get fearful,” Hodgkins said. “We’re going to spend the rest of our life healing from this trauma.”

The couple have embraced new roles as advocates for immigrants navigating an unforgiving system. They are calling for more transparency in the detention process, to spare others from the weeks of confusion they experienced. And they are speaking out against the heavy-handed response Schmidt faced for what was essentially a paperwork issue.
As dark as his experience was, Schmidt said he benefited from privileges many other ICE detainees lack. He’s a white man who speaks fluent English, with access to a top-notch legal team.
“I don’t even want to know what’s happening to other people,” he said.
Although the Wyatt holds immigration-related detainees, Hodgkins wants people to understand it is designed to hold criminals. She said the staff there had no interest in helping her with the logistics of visitation or keeping her partner comfortable and connected while inside.
“They’re not going to be nice to you,” she said. “They’re not going to be helpful to you.”
Schmidt went back to work in early June. When he was away, his projects were either put on hold, or his work had to be delegated to other people, Wilson, his coworker, said.
“I’m very relieved that he’s been released,” he said, “and very concerned for our judicial system.”
In a June 2 Facebook post, Hodgkins wrote about feeling anxious, even as Schmidt was excited about his first day back to work.
“No one prepares you for the fear and uncertainty that comes with being separated from a loved one under such traumatic circumstances,” she wrote.
“But today, we’re beginning to find our rhythm again.”

(Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Could Virginia become part of a growing national movement to elect presidents based on securing the popular vote? 
Though America is in its 47th presidency (with many presidents serving multiple terms), just five times has a candidate won the popular vote but lost the election. Although the majority of Americans voted for the losing candidate in those contests, the winners garnered enough Electoral College votes to ascend to the White House. 
The most recent example of this came in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Republican Donald Trump in 2016, despite winning the popular vote. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore was also defeated despite earning the popular vote, and lost to former President George W. Bush.
National Popular Vote, a bipartisan network of advocates nationwide, is examining whether the outcome of Virginia’s gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections could influence the state to join a growing coalition of states to support the popular vote. The organization has advocated for an interstate compact where participating states agree to honor whichever presidential candidate wins the national popular vote.
Any potential movement on the matter in Virginia would not get started until next year when the 2026 legislative session convenes. However it is a debate, typically led by Democrats, that Virginia’s legislature has explored before. 
An effort for Virginia to join the interstate compact cleared the House of Delegates in 2020 before falling in the state Senate. Lawmakers have also presented the measure again in subsequent years, but it has failed to advance. 
So far, 17 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to a compact modeled by National Popular Vote. The agreement outlines how states’ electoral colleges would award all of their votes to whichever candidate gets the most votes nationwide.
Currently, presidential candidates need to win 270 electoral college votes to win — and each amount of electoral college votes is apportioned by the population size of each state. Enough states have signed onto the NPV measure to account for 209 electoral college votes, and should Virginia join, it would add 13 more. 
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger declined to weigh in on whether or not she would sign a bill to join the compact and staff for Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears did not respond by the time of this publication. 
The popular vote proposal is not without pushback. The electoral college process often receives fresh scrutiny each time a presidential election occurs — and particularly when it benefits a candidate who failed to win the popular vote. But the electoral college is meant to be the counterweight to states with larger populations; each state, large or small, has a different number of electoral college votes allotted to them. 
The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation has defended the electoral college process. “Large cities like New York City and Los Angeles should not get to unilaterally dictate policies that affect more rural states, like North Dakota and Indiana,” the statement said. The Heritage Foundation has been a policy recommendation source for Republicans including Trump for the past several decades.
More than a rural/urban divide, sometimes electoral college debates fall along partisan lines too. 
National Popular Vote has bipartisan members, while groups like The Heritage Foundation support conservative and Republican candidates and coalitions nationwide. Cities like New York City and Los Angeles represent predominantly liberal-leaning large localities in large U.S. states, which proponents of the electoral college argue could carry too much weight without it. 
But former chairman of Michigan’s Republican Party Saul Anuzis said the idea of reform shouldn’t be partisan. He also serves as a National Popular Vote advisor. 
“This isn’t a Republican or Democratic idea — it’s a small-d democratic one,” he said.
Anuzis noted that presidential candidates focus on states that are considered swing states during election cycles, instead of engaging more deeply with voters nationwide. 
Though a politically purple state, having oscillated between partisan control of its legislature and governorship, Virginia has not been as frequent a campaign destination for presidential hopefuls as other states have been.
“When the compact kicks in, you’d see candidates campaigning for votes in Richmond, Roanoke and throughout Virginia, not just Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Arizona,” Anuzis suggested. “That’s how you rebuild trust and make elections feel like they belong to everyone.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Many signs suggest a comfortable victory this fall for Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s gubernatorial contest. Spanberger had $14.3 million in cash on hand this month compared to just $3 million for Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor. Spanberger, a former congresswoman, has led in early polls, including a whopping 17-point advantage in a Roanoke College survey in May. (Yeah, I know, many Virginians aren’t tuned in yet, so that barometer is shaky.)
Earle-Sears, meanwhile, is the standard-bearer for Donald Trump’s party in a state that’s voted against him three times in presidential contests. He’s tried to recklessly chop the federal workforce; some 341,000 federal workers lived here in 2023. Also, Black candidates have struggled to win statewide contests in Virginia – Earle-Sears’ own victory in 2021 notwithstanding.
No matter. Spanberger would be smart not to underestimate Earle-Sears. The latter has lost contests in the past, but she’s garnered her share of impressive victories, too. Few pundits thought she would unseat longtime Del. Billy Robinson in a Norfolk district in 2001.
I scoff at Earle-Sears’ television ad saying she’s not a “typical politician,” given she hews to the ultra-right party line on social and some economic issues. She faces a herculean challenge. Lots can change, though, between now and November. Spanberger should recognize that.

Please check to see if you’re immunized against measles, a disease that can kill. Virginia has had three confirmed cases this year, and an international traveler who landed at Dulles airport this month journeyed around the metro Washington area, The Washington Post reported.
“Measles is more than just a rash,” and up to one in five cases require hospitalization, Emily Rich, epidemiologist with the vaccine preventable disease team at the Virginia Department of Health, told me. Some people “even have fatal complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.”
Health care officials recommend children get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. If you’re born before 1957, you should be protected, VDH says. If you’re not sure of your status, talk to your doctor or other health care provider, Rich said. VDH has a website where you can request immunization records. As of June 12, federal officials have reported nearly 1,200 confirmed measles cases nationwide.
It would’ve helped if Trump hadn’t given the reins of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of an anti-vaccine group. That was a huge middle finger to all Americans.

I get it: Virginia Beach, the commonwealth’s largest city, has a duty to keep neighborhoods livable and safe by clearing up homeless encampments. I just wish the tenor of a recent news story had discussed more about the current conditions of people who had formerly lived in those makeshift places.
The city has cleared 100 such encampments since the spring of 2024. Those actions increased after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Grants Pass v. Johnson last June, that municipalities can enforce bans on homeless people sleeping outside in public places. The fact that homeless individuals create so many encampments suggests the magnitude of the problem – and the lack of affordable housing.
A one-day tally in January found 327 homeless people in Virginia Beach; the number is almost certainly lower than the actual total because it depends on whom the volunteers can locate that day.
Pam Shine, the city’s homeless services administrator, said through a spokesperson that about 20 people formerly in these encampments “have connected to shelter” and 10 have been housed since April 2024.
To be fair, some 138 permanent supportive housing units are designated for Virginia Beach at SupportWorks Housing complexes (formerly Virginia Supportive Housing). There are also 88 single shelter beds and 40 shelter beds for families with young children at the city’s Housing Resource Center, which opened in 2018.

The state is sending Virginians cash this week. Yes, really.
A new law means unclaimed money automatically will go to the “rightful owners,” according to axios.com. Before, you had to file a claim with the state Department of Treasury’s Unclaimed Property Division to get money from misplaced bank accounts, uncashed checks, utility deposits and more.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed the bill into law in March, requiring the state to return unclaimed funds valued at up to $5,000 owed directly to you. Find out more at vamoneysearch.gov. In fact, if you’ve lived in several places, it’s a good idea to check those individual states periodically. Trust me on this.
You can start a nationwide search at missingmoney.com, which bills itself as the “official Unclaimed Property website of the National Association of State Treasurers.”

I thought for sure Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who explicitly warned protesters beforehand at “No Kings” rallies that they’d be arrested if they broke the law on June 14, would’ve publicly condemned a motorist who, police say, drove his SUV into a crowd in Culpeper that day as a rally was ending. ’Tis a puzzlement, his silence.
One person was struck, though police reported no injuries in the Culpeper incident. Police charged a 21-year-old man in the case.
The rallies nationwide protested President Trump’s authoritarian actions while in office this term. They drowned out the obscene, costly, sparsely attended parade that Trump hosted Saturday on his 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary.

Your food and drink orders in Virginia may start to look a little different.
Starting July 1, large food vendors across the state will no longer be allowed to use single-use expanded polystyrene, a plastic foam material commonly referred to by the brand name Styrofoam. That includes plates, cups, bowls, trays and hinged containers.
State lawmakers passed the ban four years ago, following the lead of others such as Maryland, New York and Washington, D.C. Implementation was delayed. Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried unsuccessfully to push it further through a proposed budget amendment earlier this year.
For now, it only covers food vendors with 20 or more locations in Virginia, including restaurants, grocery stores, food trucks and caterers.
The law also applies to schools and community groups that use food programs such as the National School Lunch Program.
Next July, the ban will expand to all food vendors in Virginia.
Advocates say Styrofoam, though cheap to purchase, is harmful to the environment and contributes to global plastic pollution.
The material breaks apart easily, allowing bits to get loose and become litter. It also takes hundreds, or even thousands, of years to decompose and can leach toxic chemicals.




Virginia Department Of Environmental Quality




State officials launched a “Foam Free Virginia” campaign in line with the legislation.
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality recommends using reusable containers, paper products, recyclable plastic, foil or metal instead of polystyrene.
Food vendors are allowed to request a one-year exemption from their local government, demonstrating that they have no reasonable alternative and compliance would “cause significant economic hardship.”
People who violate the new law could face civil penalties of up to $50 per day, which would go into the state’s Litter Control and Recycling Fund or to the locality.
DEQ says people who want to file a complaint about ban violations should reach out to the locality where the food vendor is operating.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/styrofoam-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-06-23 06:04:17.032566

But there is a downside in the age of AI. (Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)My name is a catfish. Or, so I’ve been told. When you hear the name Jamie Jung, you might wonder if the face behind this article is a Korean girl or the great-grandson of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. A name so mysterious, perhaps even AI would struggle to decipher my identity in my job application.
When the pandemic pivoted classrooms to Zoom, I hid behind a faceless black square, only two words revealing my name.. When calling attendance, many of my teachers would pronounce my last name with a German J as “Yoong” or refer to me with the pronouns “he” or “him.” Others would sound my name out phonetically “Jung” and refer to me as “she” or “her.”  
As much as I enjoyed the curtain of anonymity, I have come to recognize there is a downside.
Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon delegate resume screening to AI tools in order to sift through countless applications from job-seekers. AI tools continue to evolve but there should be more attention on the flaws in algorithmic analysis, such as oversimplification and evaluation bias.
In 2014, Amazon attempted to automate its hiring process by building a computer program that would review applicants’ resumes and spit out a list of the top candidates. The computers were trained to assess applicants by observing resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. The problem? A majority of the applicants were men, which unintentionally taught the algorithm that male candidates were superior.
The impact of algorithmic bias is not limited to gender. A 2024 study from the University of Washington reported computer models favored white-associated names in 85.1% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1% of cases. In 2017, the University of Toronto released a study that revealed applicants with Asian names had a 28% reduced likelihood of receiving interviews compared to applicants with Anglo names. 
This pattern of discrimination even within a recruitment process solely managed by humans establishes a foundation already tainted with bias. Despite the growing diversity of the American workforce, the lack of leadership opportunities given to underrepresented communities serves as evidence of the lasting effects of systemic discrimination. According to the National Library of Medicine, although 74% of health care professionals are women, only 33% of management positions were filled by women. Similarly, while Black employees comprise 14% of all U.S. employees, only 7% of managers are Black. 










When you hear the name Jamie Jung, you might wonder if the face behind this article is a Korean girl or the great-grandson of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.


AI has the potential to revolutionize the workplace. Automating monotonous tasks within the hiring process allows employees to maximize productivity, and many human resource managers have recognized these benefits. 
But by analyzing existing demographics of the workforce, algorithms can deduce that “‘top”’ applicants who fit the standard are white men. As long as this foundation remains skewed, AI will continue to exclude talented applicants based on an outdated algorithm.
A survey by CareerBuilder states 55% of HR managers say AI will become a regular part of HR in the next five years. Although the prospects of an efficient recruitment process are appealing, managers must evaluate the current state of their workforce before integrating AI algorithms in order to provide a fair opportunity for all applicants. 
By prioritizing equal representation even before implementing AI, companies will be able to utilize algorithms with less worries about bias. The innovation of AI begins with human reflection and revision.
AI assumes that I am only what my name allows me to be, ignoring the scope of my accomplishments. I only started going by Jamie in my freshman year of high school, and I thrived under this new ambiguous identity: that year, I became the social media manager of two clubs, was selected to present a TEDx Talk, and was awarded “Freshman Writer of the Year” by my conservatory’s director. When I introduced myself in person the next school year, I was amused by the look of surprise on many of my teachers’ and classmates’ faces. It was clear I was not who they expected me to be. 
What’s in a name? According to AI algorithms, a name is the reflection of our identities and the face behind these words. I wonder if I had introduced myself as Jaehee Jung, or if I had turned on my camera to reveal my true identity, would I have had the opportunities I did? 
Maybe. My name is a gift I gave myself in search of belonging. Now I am searching to make this name my own. Not with recognition or achievements, but with the person I am behind the black square. And only I hold the power to decide when to turn it on or off.

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With the Maine Legislature mostly done with its work, Gov. Janet Mills is poised to sign hundreds of bills into law. But there are two measures to expand tribal rights in Maine that advocates worry may be bound for the veto pen.
One bill would prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use — a protection granted to most other federally recognized tribes in the U.S. The other would give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
The bills represent the latest efforts to expand recognition of tribal sovereignty since the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act excluded the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and Penobscot Nation from many rights and protections guaranteed by federal Indian Law. 
So far, sweeping changes to the Settlement Act have failed because of Mills’ opposition (an omnibus bill has been carried over to next year, so there’s still potential for this to change). Instead, the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted reforms. 
Still, it remains to be seen if these two — land seizure and gaming policy — make the cut, highlighting the real challenge the Wabanaki Nations are up against: a state government that refuses to see the tribes as inherently independent nations.
I had a flashback to my high school physics class when reading Emma Davis’ reporting on the debate around these two bills. Stick with me.
There’s a philosophical argument, known as Zeno’s dichotomy paradox, that essentially reasons that if you are trying to reach a specific destination, and you go halfway there, and you go halfway there again, and you go halfway there again, you’ll never actually arrive at your end point. You’ll always be an incremental distance away. I’m oversimplifying it, but this paradox was one of many that ancient Greeks would muddle over in pondering questions of space, time, motion, etc. 
That seems to be the approach Maine officials are taking to tribal rights.
During the Judiciary Committee’s April work session on the eminent domain bill, the Mills administration announced its opposition, despite some concessions made by the tribes and bill sponsors.
“It is impossible to know how the eventual location of these lands could impact public transportation needs in coming years, and certainly not decades into the future,” Meghan Russo, director of government affairs at Maine Department of Transportation, wrote in testimony, echoing other comments made by the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid.
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) countered that it’s an issue the state shouldn’t be in a position of debating. 
“I fundamentally think of our relationship with the tribes as a government-to-government relationship,” Lee said. “We can’t take a part of New Hampshire. We can’t take a part of Greenland or Panama,” Lee added, referring to President Donald Trump’s desires to do so.
Maine’s relationship with the tribes cannot be based on the state’s needs. It must be based on mutual trust and respect.
Similarly, the gaming bill would grant the Wabanaki the rights provided in the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
But some lawmakers are nervous about the expansion of gambling, particularly without full control over its regulation. 
Mills has not vetoed these bills yet, though tribal leaders told Davis they are not optimistic.
The eminent domain bill passed the House 86-60 with 11 Republicans joining the Democratic majority, while the Senate passed the measure 20-12. The gaming bill passed the House 85-59 but barely squeaked through the Senate. Though a majority of lawmakers support these measures, it is not enough to overcome a veto.
With Mills’ approach, taking incremental steps toward sovereignty while refusing to step back and accept the totality of the landscape, tribal sovereignty for now remains an unreachable destination.

Bipartisanship is in precious short supply these days in politics and that makes it especially tragic when elected officials waste rare opportunities to advance it.
Unfortunately, that’s what’s happening in the North Carolina Senate.
In its original form, House Bil 805 was a commonsense proposal to crack down on the sexual exploitation of women and children. It passed 113-0.
Last week, however, Senate Republicans took this important bill and loaded it up with several deeply controversial and divisive items from the far right social agenda.
Among the changes: provisions designed to make it harder for transgender people to get the health care they need and a series of new burdens on public school teachers and librarians that will create banned book lists and allow parents to veto instruction in subjects (like evolution) they claim offend their religious beliefs.
The bottom line: The Senate amendments ruin an important bipartisan bill with divisive and ill-conceived changes. The House should reject them.

(Getty Images)Surprise ambulance billing may soon become a thing of the past in New Hampshire.
Over the past few months, several lawmakers have proposed competing bills meant to address the struggles of patients who ride in an ambulance and end up surprised with massive bills after the fact. One such bill, Senate Bill 245, has now been approved by the House and Senate and is headed to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. Ayotte will have the options of signing it into law, vetoing it, or allowing it to enter into law without her signature.
Balanced billing, also known as surprise billing, happens when the price of an ambulance ride exceeds what an insurance company is willing to pay, and so the ambulance provider charges the customer the difference. SB 245 bans that practice.
“That’s the one thing we could all agree,” Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, a West Lebanon Democrat and the sponsor of SB 245, said. “But how to get there is where we had disagreement.”
SB 245 also mandates the rate providers can charge for ambulance rides. Starting in 2026, ambulance providers will be reimbursed by insurers at 325% of the federal Medicare rate. After two years, the state Insurance Department will complete an actuarial cost study to decide whether the rate should change, taking into account inflation and market factors.
SB 245 beat out several other bills targeting the same issue. House Bill 316, for example, also banned balanced billing and set a rate providers could charge. However, HB 316 incorporated an actuarial cost study previously commissioned by the Insurance Department to set a rate of 202% of the federal Medicare rate.
“The fundamental problem in this whole issue is that the Legislature’s mission is to get rid of balanced billing,” Rep. John Hunt, a Rindge Republican and the sponsor of HB 316, “That is maybe counterintuitive to what is the ambulances’ mission, which is to get private insurance to pay for the shortfall.”
Hunt said getting insurers to pay that shortfall “was a nonstarter; it was never going to happen.” So instead he worked to come up with a rate he believed was fair for both the insurers and providers by basing it on the actuarial study. 
Hunt believes municipalities should be supporting their public ambulance providers with more tax money. He also says ambulance providers should start charging patients who they treat but don’t transport.
When Hunt’s proposal, HB 316, passed the House in March, it was met with opposition from ambulance providers and some lawmakers who argued it wouldn’t pay enough to support the ambulance rides. They also argued the study used to derive that number was flawed because it didn’t properly take into account differences among communities.
“In 235 cities and towns, it’s done different ways,” Prentiss said. “Sometimes the government provides it. Sometimes a private sector provides it. Sometimes volunteers. Sometimes it’s paid career. All of these things make a big difference in what it costs you to do business.”
She said there’s “mismatch” in the field where insurers do not have such wide variety in their own work.
“So I can’t blame them 100%,” she said. “I just think there’s like these two worlds trying to come together.”
That’s why Prentiss feels action is needed to set the rates. She also hopes her bill can encourage more providers to become in-network with insurers.
Prentiss, who herself works for an ambulance provider outside of her duties as a state senator, also deemed HB 316’s rate too low and set the rate in her bill at 325% indefinitely.
Hunt thinks 325% was too much.
“As far as I’m concerned, they plucked the number out of thin air,” Hunt said.
Prentiss served on an advisory committee for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2023 and 2024. She said she came up with the rate based on her work there looking at what other states have done.
Backers of the two bills ultimately came to a compromise. They amended SB 245 to make 325% the rate for ambulance billing for two years instead of indefinitely — at which point the actuarial study determines a new rate — and they added a provision from HB 316 creating a commission to monitor the rates and the system as a whole.
“It sucks because we’re giving you guys (ambulance providers) this windfall for the next two years,” Hunt said. “At the end of the day, our mission was to get rid of balanced billing. That was the bogey that we were going after.”
He added that the rate in SB 245 is “125% more than (providers) deserve, but that was the compromise to get rid of balanced billing.”
Prentiss is happy with the compromise.
“I’m really proud of it,” she said. “I think the insurance industry came to the table. I think the Department of Insurance came to the table. I think that House Commerce, who initially had a completely different position, they came to the table. Everybody had to give something on this to get to go, and it’s going to be interesting to watch the next two years, but we’re all tied to this. And again, the common goal everyone could agree on was prohibiting balance billing and stabilizing the EMS system, but we had to do something. This has been going on for too long.”
Hunt, meanwhile, offered some advice to ambulance providers: “You guys have a huge windfall and all I can say is don’t blow it. Don’t start giving each other raises and doing all kinds of things because you’re getting this windfall, because clearly 325 (%) is way over the top.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ambulancenight-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 06:04:17.032566

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

The state recently contracted with a new investment firm to invest Legacy Fund money into in-state private infrastructure. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota plans to invest up to $150 million of Legacy Fund money in-state into land, infrastructure, agriculture and natural resources as part of a new agreement with investment firm GCM Grosvenor.
The Legacy Fund is a trust fund for the state made from oil tax revenue. The fund, which as of March was valued at nearly $12 billion, is meant to create a source of reliable income for North Dakota even after the state’s energy industry tapers off.
The Legislature made a commitment during the 2021 session to invest more Legacy Fund dollars in-state, with the goal of making money for North Dakota while also stimulating its economy.
The state has set a goal of investing $600 million into North Dakota equity. The partnership with GCM Grosvenor to invest $150 million is part of that. The money is expected to go largely to private infrastructure, including for the energy and technology industries, according to the state Retirement and Investment Office, which administers the Legacy Fund.
“All North Dakotans will benefit through increased opportunity, a broader tax base, and a stronger foundation for future growth,” Rep. Jonathan Warrey, who chairs the Legacy and Budget Stabilization Fund Advisory Board, said in an announcement this month.
Legacy Fund in-state investment program poses tricky transparency questions

A 2024 poll conducted by the North Dakota News Cooperative showed support for in-state investment of Legacy Fund dollars, with 68% of voters surveyed saying they want Legacy Fund investments to be made “within the state of North Dakota.”
The state anticipates it taking about three years for GCM Grosvenor to invest the money.
GCM Grosvenor is an investment firm based in Chicago. The State Investment Board already works with the firm, as it manages some other Legacy Fund investments.
“Because the investment strategy is project-focused rather than company-focused, there is no requirement for GCM Grosvenor to establish a North Dakota office,” Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor.
The state has already committed $250 million of the $600 million for a very different purpose: private capital investments. That money — which has gone to North Dakota companies in sectors including health care, construction, energy and more — has been managed by firm 50 South Capital since 2021. According to the Retirement and Investment Office, 50 South has committed $111.5 million of this money so far.
The state expects it to take until about 2030 for the state to invest the full $600 million.
North Dakota also puts Legacy Fund money into public infrastructure through loans issued by the Bank of North Dakota. These fixed-income investments commonly go to road improvements, according to the Retirement and Investment Office.
The in-state investment program is managed by the Retirement and Investment Office and is overseen by the State Investment Board, which Gov. Kelly Armstrong chairs.

Higher education institutions have already been feeling the effects of the law before it’s even gone into effect.  
The new law is making things more difficult for faculty and administrators, said University of Cincinnati American Association of University Professors President Stephen Mockabee.
“We’re spending time figuring out how to comply with all these state mandates, rather than focusing on research and teaching,” he said. 
The biggest short term effect higher education institutions are seeing from S.B. 1 having a hard time attracting quality candidates — ranging from full-time faculty to graduate student positions, said Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of AAUP. 
“We are seeing to a very high degree people withdrawing their name from consideration if they did apply for a position in Ohio,” she said. “I’m hearing this on a regular basis from people that are involved in those search processes.” 
Ohio State University History Professor Chris Nichols said he knows graduate students who were offered fellowships, but turned them down because of the new law.
“Any little thing could tip the balance for them,” he said. “If they’ve got an offer from Michigan and an offer from (Ohio State), Michigan is more hospitable right now, so that’s where they’re going, even if all other things are equal.” 
The University of Michigan’s astronomy department had 435 graduate school applicants this year compared to Ohio State’s astronomy department, which only had 269 graduate school applicants this year, said Laura Lopez, an Ohio State astronomy professor.
“We are comparable PhD programs, so I think their greater applicant numbers are an indication of how S.B.1 or other legislation is impacting our pool,” she said.
Mockabee said all of their job candidates have asked about S.B. 1.
“It’s not going to make it any easier to recruit,” he said. “In the long term, my concern is that we won’t be able to retain people that we’re going to see a brain drain in Ohio.” 
Some of Ohio’s public universities have started making decisions because of the new law. Ohio University announced it will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center. 
The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs. Kent State University is closing its LGBTQ+ Center, Women’s Center and Student Multicultural Center. 
“With multicultural centers being dismantled and the LGBTQ+ centers being dismantled, and the censoring of topics that we’re going to be allowed to talk about, it’s just going to totally change the dynamic of campuses and classrooms,” said Kali Barcroft, a Miami University sophomore. 
She looked at colleges out of state and ultimately chose to stay in Ohio to be close to family, but admits things would be different if this new law had been in effect.
“If (S.B. 1) was happening when I was still looking at colleges, I would be in North Carolina,” Barcroft said. 
The bill also has had a chilling effect on what courses faculty plan on teaching this fall.   
“(Faculty have) said they don’t want to teach a class like African American history because they’re afraid it might be too controversial right now or some of our new hires aren’t proposing new classes that might cause some backlash,” Nichols said. “There’s no doubt we have a chilling effect happening on classes that are proposed.”
Some faculty and staff at universities are afraid to speak out publicly against the new law, Nichols said. 
“I think some of our most vulnerable people are feeling very at risk, and they really don’t want to stick their heads up,” he said. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill in January at the start of the General Assembly. 
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said in April during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “This law will not be ignored. It will be welcomed.” 
Members of Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop S.B. 1. They have been collecting signatures since May and plan on submitting them to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose this week.  
About 248,092 signatures are needed — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. 
LaRose will then need to verify the signatures before the measure is referred to the Ohio Ballot Board to determine the language that would appear on the November ballot.

(Screenshot photo courtesy of The Ohio Channel)Recent hearings on two different resolutions related to Ohio’s support of a convention to amend the U.S. Constitution showed the strong but mixed opinions that surround the issue.
The Ohio Senate General Government Committee heard from a national group that’s leading the movement to start a constitutional convention, as well as individuals who say the idea is experimental and possibly dangerous.
The committee was reviewing Senate Joint Resolution 3, which would apply for a constitutional convention to limit federal power.
A constitutional convention can only be held if 34 state legislatures approve an application for such a convention by invoking Article V of the Constitution. The application must have a specific purpose in mind, such as a balanced federal budget or congressional term limits.
Republican state legislators have introduced bills to bring Ohio into the fold of states with applications, which currently sits at 19.
The Senate bill reviewed recently and its companion bill in the House look to amend the constitution with measures that “impose fiscal restraints on the federal government” and “limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government,” while another set of companion bills in the Ohio House and Senate specifically support congressional term limits.
A constitutional convention has not been held in the history of the United States, and while numerous states have approved applications over the years, a single issue has never garnered enough support to bring about the convention of states.
Those that support the idea say the Constitution included the concept of a constitutional convention so that it could be used, and the time has come for states to bring together delegates to help stem what they see as an overbearing federal government.
“I’m personally convinced that a convention of states is the only way to prevent a meltdown of our federal government and the ruination of our federal government,” said Broadview Heights resident and Cuyahoga Community College media and journalism professor John Kerezy.
Citing a quote from Abraham Lincoln about the “good old ship of the union,” Kerezy said “that ship is in great danger right now,” and if the Senate resolution to limit federal power isn’t passed, “its failure is imminent.”
Responding to a comment from the committee’s chair, Republican Sen. Kristina Roegner, that “several state senators and (House representatives) have expressed a concern that calling for a convention of states won’t really make a difference,” Kerezy said the concept has “the virtue of never having been tried.”
“Why would you knock something down if it’s never been tried,” Kerezy said. “Everything else is just hot air.”

Michael Farris, the cofounder of Convention of States Action, a leader in the movement to gather a convention together, dismissed concerns from opponents who said the Constitution is silent on how the convention would be controlled and that a lack of control could lead to delegates deciding on subject matters outside of the stated purpose.
“The Republican National Convention cannot nominate the Democratic candidate for president, nor can it pass laws for France,” Farris said. “The convention is limited to the subject matter.”
He also said simple math can prove that the convention of states wouldn’t have the power to make permanent change unilaterally.
“Anything that comes out of the convention has to be ratified by 38 state legislatures … so 13 chambers say no, the answer is no,” he told the committee.
 ‘A dangerous objective’
A Republican former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and current president of the Delaware, Ohio-based American Republic Policy, Dr. Alan Keyes, called the push for a convention “a dangerous objective.”
Keyes said, under the Declaration of Independence in particular, the U.S. has been successful in its mission to be a country that “did not involve the elevation of a king, it involved the elevation of a whole people in a way that would allow that people to govern itself in matters of mutual interest and defense.”
“What exactly is being achieved by a constitution convention,” Keyes asked, “except that we’re going to hand to a group of people the power to do something else that goes beyond that, and that targets … the fact that not everybody in our nation today believes in in government of, by and for the people, but they would seek to overthrow it.”
Springboro resident Robert Tuttle argued that delegates to a constitutional convention could easily lump the measures they want under the umbrella of limiting federal government power, measures that could include a national popular vote or a reproductive freedom amendment.
“’The right to reproductive freedom shall not be abridged,’” Tuttle said. “That’s a limitation on the federal government, so that could be proposed.”
The majority of public opinion supporting legal abortion and nine states having passed abortion-related state constitutional amendments should come as an important example as to what the unintended consequences of a convention could be, according to Tuttle.
“I would suggest that if you’re pro-life, you don’t want to be anywhere near this thing,” Tuttle said. “Because you can bet your bottom dollar that that will be proposed and it has a decent chance of ratification in the states.”
 Delegate appointments
Potentially looking to address some of the concerns critics have of a convention’s lack of procedure, Senate Republicans also introduced Senate Bill 112, which would establish an appointment procedure for a constitutional convention.
The bill had a hearing in Senate General Government the same day as the the convention resolution itself.
The bill requires the General Assembly to appoint an odd number of delegates using a concurrent resolution or a majority vote in a joint session.
Delegates would be qualified under the bill if they are 25 or older, a registered elector have been a U.S. citizen and an Ohio resident for at least five years, and do not hold federal or statewide office.
The resolution appointing the delegates must contain a delegate’s “commission” and “the scope of the delegates’ authority,” while still allowing the General Assembly to give additional instructions in separate resolutions.
Part of the “convention conduct” required of delegates under the measure would involve “criminal prohibitions” if delegates vote to “take certain actions” or if they accept “certain gifts.”
An advisory committee would also be empaneled to answer delegate questions, “monitor the delegation” and report “perceived violations,” while also having the authority to investigate whether a delegate has “exceeded the scope of the delegate’s authority.”
Bill opponent Barbara Burkard noted the criminal penalties part of the legislation as a part of her opposition to the “faithful delegate pledge.”
“That’s just plain ridiculous,” Burkard told the committee. “Delegates to an Article V convention will have the highest authority in our nation, and they can not be legally charged for decisions they make in a convention because Article V gives them that right to make those decisions and the authority to do so.”
She also scoffed at the idea that Ohio legislators should authorize a pledge of “faithfulness” to delegates, when she said they themselves have fallen down on similar pledges.
She brought up the race for House Speaker in 2023, when former Speaker Jason Stephens took up the gavel. Stephen gained the speakership after a dramatic change of vote from many in the GOP caucus, and a collaboration with Democrats to see Stephens take the seat over former state Rep. Derek Merrin, whom the GOP caucus had voted to support before the formal vote.
“Why should these legislators tell delegates to sign a pledge of faithfulness when they themselves fail in the faithfulness category,” Burkard asked.

Ford/Maryland Matters)Andrew Friedson officially announced plans Sunday to seek the Democratic nomination for Montgomery County executive, becoming the fifth Democrat to get in the race for the June 2026 primary.
Friedson, who unofficially said he would run more than a week ago, addressed several hundred people who turned out on a hot Sunday evening in Cabin John Regional Park. Supporters touted the Montgomery County Councilmember as the only candidate to present a brighter future for the state’s largest jurisdiction, with more than 1 million people.
“When I was first getting into politics on a campaign, what really struck me is that Andrew listens. He still does, and that’s one of [his] greatest qualities,” said Marko Rivera-Oven, executive director of The Upcounty Hub, a nonprofit that operates a food pantry. “I believe that Montgomery County will be better if Andrew Friedson is our next county executive.”
Several others also praised Friedson, including former Maryland Democratic Party Chair Susan W. Turnbull, who has led several national Jewish organizations, and Sen. Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery).
Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, introduced Friedson, whom he called a “point person” on the Maryland ABLE Act, which allows Maryland families to invest money for individuals with disabilities. The act was signed into law in 2016, the same year Friedson worked as a senior policy adviser for the Maryland Comptroller’s Office.

On a lighter note, Feldman recalled that Friedson worked in his office for one session when Friedson attended the University of Maryland, College Park. After graduating in 2008, Friedson went to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a student in a class taught by Feldman.
“If you like him, and you’re going to support him, everything that he has done in elective office, [just] give me credit. That’s all because of me,” Feldman said to laughter from attendees.
Friedson made history in Montgomery County when he was elected in 2018 as the youngest councilmember ever, at age 32.
Prior to his work on the council, he was the interim executive director of the Maryland 529 College Savings Program and served on the Maryland Small Business Development Financing Authority in 2016 and 2017.
Friedson, now 39, said his priorties include providing affordable housing, supporting businesses and ensuring the county executive works with the public schools superintendent “but holds the school system accountable for the public tax dollars that we spend.”
Friedson said the coalition he’s building is about family.
“We don’t win by shouting from our mountain tops as loud or more loudly than the other team is shouting from theirs,” he said. “We make the case by proving that government can work, starting at the local level and getting the little things right, so we can get trust from people that we can do the big things.”
So far, at least two of Friedson’s County Council colleagues, both members of the class of 2018, like Friedson, are seeking the Democratic nomination for county executive.
At-Large County Councilmember Evan Glass plans to use the county’s public financing option. Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
County Council Vice President Will Jawando (D-At-Large), also elected that year to the council, has the backing of current County Executive Marc Elrich (D). Elrich’s is term limited and cannot seek a third term.

Without directly saying Friedson’s name, Elrich said at Jawando’s campaign announcement last month that residents shouldn’t support a candidate with millions of dollars from developers.
In January, Friedson already had $1 million cash on hand.
“I am extremely proud of the overwhelming support that we have received from everybody in our community, and we saw it here today at our kickoff with a diverse crowd,” Friedson said in an interview with reporters Sunday. “I’m not focused on what other people are saying. I’m not focused on the attacks. I’m running on my record and other people should run on theirs.”
At least two other candidates have announced bids or officially filed paperwork to seek the Democratic nomination in the June 2026 primary election.
Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today. Another candidate seeking the Democratic nomination is Mithun Banerjee, a landlord from Silver Spring who filed his candidacy last month.
As of Friday, Iroha and Banerjee were the only two people to file documentation for the seat. According to the state Board of Elections, no Republicans have filed for the seat.
The candidate filing deadline is 9 p.m. Feb. 24.

The allegations include distributing drugs with Chinese and Korean labels from firms not registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, drugs that were labeled in the clinic and drugs prescribed for a clinic’s owner, but put into its stock. The clinic stopped using one drug when patients said “it burned,” a board of pharmacy inspection report said.
The suspensions bring to more than 10 the number of such licenses the pharmacy board has suspended this year on similar allegations. As markets boom for lucrative GLP-1 weight-loss drugs as well as those for other cosmetic procedures, observers have said it’s created a wild-west atmosphere among the clinics that sell them.
The weight-loss drugs are similar to Ozempic and Wegovy, and as demand for them has soared, so have shortages and concerns that the people most in need can’t get them. There are also worries that improperly formulated drugs might be used and that the unscrupulous might be cashing in. 
The drugs carry an average annual list price of $12,000, according to the Peterson KFF Health Tracker.
On Tuesday, the pharmacy board issued an order to summarily suspend the drug-distribution license of Enbody in Shaker Heights after a June 5 inspection.
“The inspection revealed Enbody was in possession of illegal drugs,” the order said. “These drugs were purchased from illegitimate entities that are not licensed wholesale drug distributors or drug manufacturers in the United States and do not have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) manufacturer registration. These drugs are counterfeit and/or ‘For Research Use Only’ and these drugs are not FDA-approved medications.”
Among the drugs listed were tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide and retatrutide, all weight-loss drugs that diminish appetite. 
“Enbody purchased dangerous drugs direct from multiple unlicensed manufacturers in China and from the Amazon website,” the report said.
Inspectors also found drugs labeled “for research use only.”  In January, the board suspended licenses to distribute dangerous drugs held by clinics in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus. It accused them of giving patients weight-loss drugs that were labeled “for research use only” and that came from “an unlicensed out-of-state-seller.”
At Enbody, inspectors also said they found vials of bacteriostatic water purchased off of Amazon, but not through its pharmacy. It’s supposed to be a sterile solution for use in injecting drugs. But an official at the clinic said she stopped using it because patients said “it burned,” the report said.
The board of pharmacy also suspended:

Hyperbaric Therapy of Dublin — Inspectors said they found unapproved drugs, including mistletoe extract, curcumin, and oak extract. They also said that “drugs prescribed to the clinic’s owner, Christopher Dodson, had been ordered and shipped from a 503A compounding pharmacy. These patient-specific dangerous drugs were then being utilized as office drug stock.”
Dermatology, Laser and Vein Center, Montgomery — Inspectors said they found the cosmetic drug liporase, which isn’t approved by the FDA and was purchased from a supplier not licensed by the board of pharmacy. An invoice said three vials had been purchased, and the person running the clinic claimed they were never used. She said two had been destroyed, but could produce no record of their destruction, the report said.
Zinni Family Practice, Canfield — Inspectors said they found several different cosmetic skin drugs that weren’t FDA approved, seven expired drugs of other types, and problems with documentation and storage.

Meanwhile, the FDA seems to be undermining its own mission to ensure that drugs are safe. Last week, the news organization ProPublica reported that for more than 12 years, a secretive group within the agency has at times overruled inspectors of overseas “factories with mold, foul water, dirty labs or fraudulent testing protocols.” The internal group allowed those factories to ship drugs to the United States anyway, the story said.

Santiago/Getty Images)A month of gun violence is prompting new calls for firearm safety regulations. But with a GOP-controlled legislature, some Ohio advocates say they may need to take the laws into their own hands, through a constitutional amendment.
In Ohio, a toddler discharged a gun after finding it in a couch. A third grader brought a loaded firearm and threatened classmates, and mass shootings remain unsolved.
Over the past week, all across the state, shootings killed, wounded, and terrified dozens.
Two weeks ago, roughly 70 shots were fired during a car meet in Cleveland. Seven people, aged 18 and 19 years old, were shot and survived.
Last week, Cleveland had three overnight shootings, leaving two people dead and at least five injured. The youngest victim was a 13-year-old, who survived.
Last week in Akron, a 15-year-old boy was killed, and the police are still looking for the shooter.
Last week in Columbus, an 18-year-old was killed and seven others were injured, local police said. At least one other person died from a shooting this week.
This week, a 14-year-old was shot in Akron on Wednesday. Another man was shot in Downtown Cleveland early Thursday morning.
These are just several examples, not an exhaustive list. Gun violence typically also increases in the summer months, police say.
“It’s completely unacceptable that nobody is doing anything about it,” Columbus-area mother Michelle Heym said.
She is frustrated by the inaction to help protect Ohioans and her kids from tragedies.
Heym is originally from Connecticut but moved in 2015, two and a half years after being traumatized when her daughters were on lockdown during the Sandy Hook massacre.
Then, four years later, she dealt with the fear of the deadly 2019 mass shooting in Dayton. Since then, she has gotten more involved in advocacy against gun violence.
“I immediately wanted to get involved somehow to stop the gun violence in schools,” Heym said.
And Democratic lawmakers agree with her. They have been proposing safety regulations for years, like red flag laws, universal background checks and requirements to lock up guns so kids can’t access them.
The bills rarely, if at all, get serious consideration in the Ohio House and Senate, both dominated by gun-rights Republican Supermajorities.
“How many funerals will it take before this legislature does its job?” state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, said during a press conference on Democratic bills to address the violence.
Because the legislature hasn’t acted on gun reform, some cities are attempting to create ordinances that better protect their populations. Both Columbus and Cincinnati have several gun safety regulations, but the state and Columbus are now in a legal battle.
While the Dems haven’t been successful with passing legislation through the General Assembly, they have won at the ballot box.
In 2023, voters overwhelmingly protected access to abortion, legalized marijuana, and kept majority rule for voting.
“I think what we have seen on a number of issues, when we have a legislature that is out of touch with where most Ohioans are — and we saw it with the reproductive freedom and I think we see it with this issue of addressing gun violence and common sense reforms — the people eventually do rise up,” House Minority Leader Allison Russo said.
She said that it “wouldn’t be surprising” if reform were proposed in the next few years.
Back in 2023, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb brought up an idea for a constitutional amendment after a mass shooting.
Heym, now the Ohio legislative lead for Moms Demand Action, said she wants this to happen. She offered ideas of expanded background checks and safe storage.
“There are people at Moms Demand Action that have, in the past, entertained constitutional amendments and even supported constitutional amendments in Ohio,” she said.
But it would face uphill challenges, with GOP leaders saying this would go against the Second Amendment.
“Requiring someone to always store their firearm in a safe place, in storage, is going to be ruled unconstitutional,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
Williams is a supporter of responsible gun ownership, and he does have locks for some of his guns. The issue is also personal to him, as he said his best friend’s 2-year-old daughter accidentally shot and killed herself with her father’s gun.
“I understand that these situations occur, but that doesn’t mean that you can violate the constitutional rights of every other law-abiding citizen,” he said.
He said one bad actor doesn’t reflect the majority, and the better way of fighting gun violence is through the back end, like raising criminal penalties.
“Getting the repeat offenders off of the street, getting the firearms out of the hands of felons,” he said, mentioning his bill, H.B. 5, increases penalties for violent offenders in possession of a firearm while they are under disability for previous felony convictions.
It passed out of the House in a bipartisan fashion, with some Democrats joining the Republicans on a 71-24 vote.
Being reactive to violence isn’t enough, Heym said.
“Hopefully, the people will rise up,” she said.
Other gun safety advocacy groups informed us that they would also support a constitutional amendment.
The Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio also stated that they would want to review the details and can’t comment yet, but would consider or support any measures that make communities safer and allow police to do their jobs.

Thompson Federal Courthouse on June 13. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A federal magistrate judge in Nashville has denied the government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to a Salvadoran prison by U.S. immigration officials.
Federal prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to appeal the decision. Both the decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and the notice of appeal were filed Sunday.
In denying the government’s motion to keep Abrego detained, Holmes acknowledged that if he is released he will likely be taken into custody immediately by  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Nevertheless, Holmes ruling said “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
U.S. says Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit over deportation is moot, must be dismissed

Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed federal prosecutors’ arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager as lacking clear evidence.
Some photos and body camera footage from the 2022 traffic stop are no longer available, Holmes notes, and much of the government’s case is build on second- and third-person hearsay.
Two of the witnesses cooperating with the government are members of the smuggling organization Abrego is accused of being part of: One received early release from a federal smuggling conviction and expects to get a work permit in exchange for his testimony, the other currently faces federal charges but hopes to be released, and has requested deportation deferral, in exchange for his testimony, Holmes said.
A third witness is closely related to the first two, and has requested deportation deferral in exchange for her cooperation. Her family is affiliated with a separate gang, the 18th Street or 18 Barrio gang, Holmes’ ruling says.
Holmes also questioned the government’s claims that Abrego is a member of the MS-13 gang, which she said “consists of general statements, all double hearsay,” from two of the cooperating witnesses. One said Abrego was “familial” with purported gang members and the other said she “believed” he was in the gang.
Those statements were countered by the third witness who “specifically repudiates” any suggestion that Abrego was a gang member, saying that “in ten years of acquaintance with Abrego, there were no signs or markings, including tattoos, indicating that Abrego is an MS-13 member.” Evidence that Abrego is a member of MS-13 is “simply insufficient,” Holmes wrote.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny of Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

Those of us who lived through the Middle Eastern quagmires of the early 2000s can all too easily recall the mixture of fear and dismay that accompanied watching American forces head to foreign lands. For those of you too young to remember, I fervently hope this particular war winds up with the least amount of carnage possible for Americans, Israelis and Iranians.
Here’s the real challenge in grappling with times like these. When it comes to American foreign policy and the actions of those in Washington, D.C., deciding our nation’s response to foreign threats, there’s not a great deal that any one of us can do. There is also the risk that our leaders use foreign conflict as a distraction from vital matters at the state and national levels.
Right now, today, Kansans cannot decide what Iran does or how the Pentagon behaves. We have a critical role in deciding what happens to this state, however, and I want to write about a handful of other issues facing us today. These are real. These are pressing.
Don’t forget them as commentators slobber over the latest batch of “WAR!” headlines, chyrons and social media posts.

Medicaid threat
More than 1,500 Kansans have died because of the failure of Republican lawmakers in Kansas to expand the state’s Medicaid program.
Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith reported earlier this month that Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., could add to that shameful toll. They plan cuts to the existing, skimpy program: “A new analysis of cuts contained in the GOP’s ‘big beautiful bill’ under consideration by Congress shows that 13,000 Kansans would lose enrollment in Medicaid, and the state would lose $3.77 billion in federal funding.”
Online outlets Politico and The Hill have highlighted U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran’s alarm over potential program cuts, writing that he and a handful of other Republican lawmakers had “raised concerns” and “drawn public red lines.” That’s a welcome contrast to our state’s other U.S. senator, Roger Marshall, who can’t take a step without putting his foot in his mouth.
Senators will face enormous pressure this week as Majority Leader John Thune tries to push through President Donald Trump’s legislative centerpiece.
The potential coverage loses matter. Our senators’ votes matter.
The lives of Kansans matter.

Local elections
Kansans won’t vote on their state or federal lawmakers in 2025. We will, however, vote for municipal officials.
Take a look at this information page of Secretary of State Scott Schwab. The deadline to register or update your information for the primary is July 15, with advance voting beginning the next day. Primaries will be held Aug. 5
The deadline to register or update personal information for the general election is Oct. 14, with advance voting starting the next day. The general election takes place Nov. 4.
I know that local elections don’t see the kind of excitement or coverage or late-night thrills of presidential contests or even midterms. But they arguably make more of a difference in our daily lives. Local officials set property taxes and allocate services. They chart the courses for school districts and a multitude of other public programs. If you don’t know about the issues in your city or town, there’s still time to reach out and learn.
You’ll be standing up for yourself and your neighbors.

Big amendment
A constitutional amendment changing the selection process for Kansas Supreme Court judges will appear on the August 2026 ballot.
You will hear an awful lot about the vote in months ahead. Kansas Reflector has already run a column from a retired judge on the subject. You can read the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas’ take on the situation here. Lawmakers passed a ban on financial contributions to amendment campaigns from “foreign nationals” to tilt the playing field on just this issue.
Someone else making his voice heard over the weekend was Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, who shared this statement from the state GOP on Saturday.

I am deeply appreciative that the Kansas Republican Party voted unanimously to endorse the constitutional amendment providing for the direct election of our Kansas Supreme Court. On your primary ballot next August, we need all hands on deck to pass this once in an lifetime… pic.twitter.com/SURc2stwX5
— Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson (@sentymasterson) June 22, 2025

Kansans already cast regular retention votes for members of the Supreme Court. But the popular-vote plan would clear the way for big money interests to back hard-right candidates. Those justices might just be more willing to let lawmakers ban abortion and cut funding for public education. Not that Republican lawmakers would ever want to do such things, of course.
As you can see, Kansans have a lot to pay attention to over the next 14 months or so. We haven’t even gotten to the 2026 general elections.
War coverage will continue. I’ll watch and read it, along with the rest of you. But let’s keep an eye on those local needs, issues and principles.

With the rise of EVs, Lordstown got a glimmer of hope. Lordstown Assembly stayed closed, but GM formed a new company, Ultium, which opened a massive EV battery facility right around the corner, buoyed by federal subsidies for the emerging industry.
As the U.S. Senate debates Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the people of Lordstown, Ohio, have a simple message: don’t shut us down again. I am the proud leader for the United Auto Workers in Region 2B, which covers Ohio and Indiana, and I hope the U.S. Senators representing our states will hear that message. 
It is time for the Senate to stand up for our members and the working class. America must preserve clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have given communities like Lordstown a lifeline.
These credits helped make it possible for the UAW to organize the first union battery cell manufacturing facility in the country at Ultium. There is also a new StarPlus Energy Gigafactory in Kokomo, Indiana, a joint venture between Samsung and Stellantis. 
This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty. 
Just recently, workers at the StarPlus battery facility also voted to be recognized by the UAW, following in the footsteps of the workers at Ultium Cells in Lordstown. 
GM is planning on building another battery plant in northern Indiana, and the companies, workers, and communities need to have stability moving forward. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Our contracts at these facilities have helped set a new standard for wages, benefits, and health and safety in EV battery manufacturing for workers everywhere. And we’re just getting started. 
These targeted energy and manufacturing tax incentives have enabled billions in private investment, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The advanced manufacturing tax credit is driving major growth in the battery supply chain, and we are organizing across the country to create tens of thousands of union battery jobs. 
Meanwhile, the consumer electric vehicle tax credit has boosted demand for the batteries our members produce in Kokomo, Lordstown, and across our nation.
We’re witnessing a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and when these new jobs have the benefits that come with collective bargaining—better wages, safer working conditions, health care, retirement security, and a voice on the job — they lead to the kind of family-supporting careers that built the American Dream.
Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would devastate this progress and harm workers, and the Senate has so far failed to fix the bill. 
This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America. The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted. 
Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (EV) sales by as much as 40% by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned EV battery manufacturing facilities.
The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family-supporting. Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs. 
They’re choosing to undermine American manufacturing in favor of what exactly? Tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?
This isn’t about party politics — it’s about our economic future. And the UAW has long said there is room for improvement in the design of these credits. 
Too many companies taking the money are guilty of paying substandard wages and benefits, illegal union busting, and dangerous working conditions. 
Subsidies like these need strings attached to protect workers; we can do better than corporate giveaways. But gutting the whole thing isn’t the answer. 
Instead of kneecapping the credits, Congress should improve them: most importantly, by making wage and benefit standards a prerequisite for receiving the advanced manufacturing tax credit. 
The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future. 
The working class deserves leaders who will fight for our economic interests, not legislators who would rather slash taxes for the wealthy and greedy corporations while raising energy prices, sabotaging domestic manufacturing, and kicking millions off their health care to boot.  
When our government invests in good, American jobs, workers, and communities win. Now it’s time for our Senators to decide if they’re on our side.

(Photo courtesy of Upland Grassroots)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency restored two of the three Maine-based grants for forever chemical research that it terminated this spring.
Without explaining why, or first considering the researchers’ appeals, the EPA notified teams led by the Mi’kmaq Nation and the University of Maine that their grants have been reinstated this month, however the agency has yet to notify the Passamaquoddy Tribe about whether their grant will be restored. 
After Maine Morning Star reporting revealed conflicting agency stances on the terminations, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine requested EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin address the inconsistencies by May 30. Pingree has yet to receive a response. 
Pingree told Maine Morning Star she was pleased to see the grants restored but that they shouldn’t have been terminated in the first place. 
“Unfortunately, this is just one example of a much broader problem,” Pingree said. 
Pingree pointed to other proposed cuts to environmental programs, such as a 55% funding cut to the EPA budget and the elimination of other PFAS grants that support cleanup and prevention efforts in vulnerable communities. “While I’m glad funding for this project was reinstated, we’re still fighting to protect the many others that remain on the chopping block,” she said.
The researchers also expressed cautious optimism as they plan to forge ahead.
Despite saying PFAS contamination is a priority, EPA cut millions in funding for research in Maine

“Because of this whole situation, I don’t feel as totally sure about [the funding] as I did when we first got the grant,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “But of course, we are just going to go forward and do all of our work, I’m sure maybe at an accelerated pace in some ways, just to do as much testing as we can.” 
In May, the EPA terminated all of the four-year grants it had awarded in September for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in the food supply, including to the three Maine-based teams. The three grants for Maine projects amount to almost $5 million. 
The termination notices read, “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
However, the agency later gave conflicting responses about why it terminated the grants. 
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, the EPA Press Office equated the grants to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. 
“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
However, Zeldin publicly stated the grants were important and already congressionally appropriated. In the weeks leading up to the terminations, the agency also named combating PFAS contamination as a priority.
All three of the Maine-based research teams appealed their grant terminations. However, in the emails the EPA sent the UMaine and Mi’kmaq Nation teams, the agency said the reinstatement decisions were made by agency leadership unrelated to their appeals. 
UMaine had formally appealed the termination on June 5, but the EPA wrote in a June 6 email, “The reinstatement was directed by agency leadership on June 4, 2025, prior to the issuance of a decision on a dispute filed by the University of Maine on June 5, 2025.”
The Mi’kmaq Nation filed their appeal earlier and received an email on June 5 acknowledging receipt. On June 18, the team received another email notifying them that their grant had been reinstated. But that email stated that the restoration was directed by agency leadership prior to the issuance of a decision on the dispute, and that the dispute was now moot. 
While acknowledging receipt, the EPA did not respond to requests for comment regarding why agency leadership reinstated these two grants, or whether the agency intends to reinstate the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s grant.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

For Stanley, the reinstatement underscored the power elected leaders can yield to push back on cuts, noting Pingree’s letter to Zeldin. 
“I do feel like in this case, the representatives and senators can play a big role,” Stanley said. 
Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia, which is working in partnership with the Mi’kmaq Nation on its grant, said for him the termination and subsequent reinstatement illustrated the convoluted political fault lines within federal research funding. 
“I was shocked when it happened just because of how it’s a topic that I think really is very non-political,” Berger said. “I have friends who are very conservative to very liberal and everybody agrees that nobody wants perfluorinated chemicals in their food and water.”
Berger said he was heartened that Zeldin seemed to want to prioritize PFAS research when Pingree had questioned him on the terminations during an appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 15. But at the same time, Berger said, “What he was saying seemed to be the antithesis of what was happening.” 
However, Berger added, “I think to be a scientist, you have to be relentlessly optimistic.”
A scientist’s work constantly grapples with struggle and failure, he explained, “so if you’re not an optimist, you can’t do this job.”

A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
NM lawmakers review security practices after Minnesota assassination

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., is the current owner of an IOU worth millions of dollars. The chit is the result of his vote for the small-minded, unattractive and unpopular bill working its way through Congress, part of which will cut funding for Nebraska Public Media (NPM).
Full disclosure: In the past I have contributed several op-ed pieces for Nebraska Public Radio and have twice been a guest on “All About Books,” discussing one book I read and another I wrote. I have been a financial supporter of Nebraska Public Media.
Bacon said the House Speaker assured him that money lost in the massive bill would be restored later. His optimism is noteworthy (or perhaps naive) in a place where the only sure thing these days is that nothing is a sure thing. We’re teeter tottering on tariffs, immigration and war, with policies seemingly changing based on the latest news cycle.  Or worse, whims.
Right instincts
The congressman’s instincts were right. Cutting funds to NPM would especially hurt the rural parts of the state. That’s where, according to NPM leadership, the loss of funds — even though only a percentage of the networks’ total budget — would have the greatest impact. 
His colleague, U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., said he voted for the bill because its “spending priorities (were) overwhelmingly supported by the American people at the ballot box last November.” Last I checked, 49.8% of the vote is anything but overwhelming.
Even though Bacon’s vote matched his concern, hearing him raise it from the majority seats was an outlier in a Congress on the verge — at least in practice — of abdicating its role as a co-equal member of the republic’s three branches of government. 
The push to defend PBS and National Public Radio has been a goal of those now pulling the levers of government for some time. As far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with fiscal mismanagement, poor performance or any nefarious practice.
Content fight
It’s simply about content, which apparently doesn’t match the administration’s world view. Curiously, in the Media Bias Chart, an ongoing research project from Ad Fontes, both NPR and PBS rank near the top of all media outlets for their lack of bias. You can see the research here.
Getting accurate news is an increasing problem. Misinformed, disinformed or uninformed people are serious drags on a dynamic democracy. One solution is accurate reporting from credible news sources such as those at the top of the Media Bias Chart, including PBS and NPR. 
Another is the introduction in schools of thinking and reasoning skills, learning to sift fact from fiction that is being sold either by mistake or devious scheme.
The Nebraska Legislature adjourned earlier this month after passing a law that limits cell phone use in schools and another requiring schools to address discrimination and antisemitism issues. Other educational bills were left on the table, including some that are best left there. 
Smart news consumers vital
Still, as the government moves to defund a source of information it apparently doesn’t like, schools can remain bulwarks against disinformation. They can also serve as a counterbalance to a new information eyesore: the rewriting of American history.
Along Highway 395 in California’s Sierra Nevada range is a sacred obelisk, its bright white a contrast against the stark environment of high desert just west of Death Valley. The monument is part of the Manzanar National Historic Site, commemorating Camp Manzanar where 10,000 Japanese Americans — nearly all U.S. citizens — were interned during World War II.
I once stopped at Manzanar on the way home from a fishing trip to Mammoth Lakes, in part because of its historic past and in part because my friend, Mitz Sasahara, was a child there. I found an eerie, unsettling silence at Manzanar, perhaps because I knew a little of the toll it took on Mitz and his family.
Now, however, the government has installed two signs at Manzanar, which, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, “encourage visitors to report any depictions of U.S. history that ‘inappropriately disparage Americans past or living’ or fail to highlight the ‘beauty, abundance or grandeur.’” Similar signs are now posted at every national park.
Nevermind deputizing tourists as amatuer snitches. Are we now downplaying, diffusing or even dismissing what is our history? Perhaps the Nebraska Legislature or state education officials can’t write a curriculum that teaches our kids to challenge disinformation or the rewriting of history. Perhaps Nebraska Public Media will be hamstrung in its ability to bring us the facts. 
Nevertheless, in a democracy, demanding the truth is not simply our right. It’s our responsibility.

Getty Images.The next generation of Georgia youths may be able to decipher those birthday cards from grandma without any help from a grown-up.
That’s because Georgia’s new English language arts standards, which take effect in July, will include an emphasis on handwriting, and particularly cursive. The standards will address handwriting starting in kindergarten and move to cursive in third through fifth grade. The previous standards did not have an explicit place for handwriting.
“We want to ensure that our students, when they graduate from the state of Georgia, have all the skills they need,” said April Aldridge, deputy superintendent of teaching and learning at the Georgia Department of Education. “In the world we live in, that means we have to have a varied degree of skills and we need to know when to use the skills in which situations.”
“The skill of handwriting, I wouldn’t say that it’s an antiquated skill because I think most of us use handwriting at some point in our lives every single day, whether it’s in formal or informal situations, so I think it’s just one of the tools that students need to be proficient in,” she added.
While some parents may embrace it, others parents question whether incorporating cursive lessons into English class is the best use of instruction time.
Some said students would be better served by using their instructional time to learn to type or become more savvy with technology.
Brittany Klein, a parent of children in the Cherokee County School System, said she taught her daughter cursive during the COVID-19 pandemic and her son learned it in school, but don’t ask either of them to write in cursive today.
“I am not opposed to cursive,” she said. “I just think if they aren’t going to use it regularly it’s a wasted skill. My kids aren’t even in high school yet and they completely forgot.”
But Sarah Welch, an English language arts program specialist with the Georgia Department of Education, said there’s a greater benefit to mastering handwriting than signing on the dotted line or interpreting grandma’s birthday wishes.
When kids are fluent writers, they can dedicate more brain power to expressing their thoughts instead of moving their pencils.
“If they’re putting so much emphasis on forming the letters and writing the words, that’s taking away their ability to really focus on organizing and expressing their ideas clearly,” Welch said. “And so the research actually shows that cursive handwriting – which is faster than print – really, it enhances their writing fluency. It also supports spelling, but aside from that it really frees up their cognitive resources to let them dig into those higher level reading and higher level writing tasks and being able to organize and express their thoughts because that’s where their minds can go.”
Reinhardt University education professor Debby Pinion, who teaches teachers about reading and dyslexia, said she thinks the new standards will be good for all students but could be especially helpful for children with dyslexia.
That’s because unlike writing block letters, which involves a lot of picking up and putting back down your pencil, when you write in cursive, each word is its own discrete unit.
“With cursive handwriting, it’s a continuous motion until the end of the word,” she said. “So students who are having trouble with position and writing then have an easier time because it just flows per word instead of a manuscript, which is just one letter at a time. So they don’t have to stop and think, ‘which way do I go? Where are the lines? What do I do?’”
“The key word is fluency,” she added. “Just like when we read fluently, that’s not really how fast, but really how smoothly we read. And the same thing is for writing. It helps with fluency so that you’re not starting and stopping, which then impedes your thought process when the object of the game is to write something. So if how we’re writing decreases the flow of our brain fluency, then that’s a problem for students with dyslexia. But cursive handwriting, like any strategy that is used for a child with dyslexia, helps all children. It raises all the ships in the sea.”

For the second year in a row, marchers wore yellow ribbons and held signs calling for the return of the hostages from Gaza. 
Those whom Hamas and other terrorist groups are still holding were top of mind for all, especially as former hostages recounted the abuse and torture they suffered in Hamas’ terror tunnels. While celebrating the release of American Edan Alexander, who was the last living American hostage, the bodies of four dead Americans, Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai, and Judi Weinstein Haggai, are as of this writing still being held by Hamas, presumably as bargaining chips. [Israeli forces recovered the remains of Judy Weinstein and Gad Haggai on June 5.–Ed.]
I mention these names because we’re seeing a resurgence of nonsense and falsity from “pro-Palestinian” groups, who want us to believe that this war comes from Israeli aggression or “colonialism.” They tell us that peace is possible if only Israel would disarm, which would spell an end to Israel at the hands of an irrationally hostile and antisemitic Arab world. 
It’s worth remembering that on October 6, 2023, Israel wasn’t at war. The aggressor and catalyst on October 7 was Hamas, not Israel. That aside, the “pro-Palestinian” position shows a complete ignorance of history. To ask Israel to do anything less in the protection of its citizens is easy if you aren’t the one whose brother is being tortured in a tunnel, if it isn’t your mother’s remains being held by terrorists and if Hamas were not sworn and committed by its Charter and its actions to the murder of all Jewish people. 
War is terrible and never prosecuted perfectly, but Hamas and its proxies and allies are not properly in a position to call the shots or make demands. It will take very talented negotiators to find a path to peace, if peace is even possible in the face of the Palestinian Authority’s ongoing bounties to terrorists who kill Jews and Hamas’ foundational raison d’être of eliminating Israel as the world’s only Jewish state, which is the meaning of the chant “Free, free Palestine.” This is a harsh reality that is hard for us as Americans to appreciate.
For everything we know about October 7, it was worse. Most Americans haven’t yet been told or have come to terms with the fact it wasn’t just Hamas who attacked, but it was also Palestinian supporters, who came over the border and committed vile and brutal atrocities. 
Palestinian civilians, who had elected Hamas,  looted and burned entire neighborhoods, kidnapped infants and senior citizens, and raped and murdered their way through Israel’s south. Much like the Nazis, Hamas documented their atrocities. Survivors have given testimony, and the world has seen evidence of the complicity of teachers, doctors, journalists, and others – including some U.N. staff! – in the planning and the attack. 
There is no justification. There is no excuse. No accusation of an “open air prison” or “colonialism” will work here. No Jews have resided in Gaza since 2005. The world has generously supported Gaza through UNRWA for 75 years. Collectively, we’ve spent billions to create a fully functional and economically independent region for Gazans. Even Hamas’ most effective talking point, the death toll figures, are starting to unravel. The deep dive by the Henry Jackson Society is worth reading to get the facts straight.
As is true in all wars, there are innocent victims in Gaza. Gazan children have had their futures sacrificed by the very adults who should be protecting them. Hamas didn’t make any provision for evacuating them from what they knew would be a war zone, never brought families into the shelter of tunnel networks and underground cities which they had built with foreign aid, and steals humanitarian aid meant to feed and care for the populace. 
But Hamas’ influence over news media reporting from Gaza results in highly skewed reporting, as they ensure that the people’s anguished faces appear with every news article while they at the same time are willingly sacrificing those people. It’s abhorrent. Where are the “pro-Palestinian” groups on this? If they were really pro-Palestinian, they would condemn Hamas and terrorism, recognize Israel’s right to exist, and chart an honest path forward for the next generation. However, these radical groups have a very different agenda from supporting Palestinian people.

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark outside of the Minnesota State Capitol Tuesday, June 17, 2025 in St. Paul. Activists gathered Sunday to figure out what to do now. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Monique Lacroix of Carver County said going to rallies and speaking in front of elected officials might make her uncomfortable, but the moment mandates action. 
“This is the time to put yourself out there and do what you can,” Lacroix said.
Lacroix was at a “Defending Democracy Summit” at a south Minneapolis church Sunday, hosted  by We Choose Us, a pro-democracy coalition with about 40 partners across the state.
Barely a week after the assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and the shooting of DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and Yvette Hoffman, Minnesotans are grappling with how to support democracy in a time of political violence and what analysts call “democratic backsliding.” 
Speakers at the south Minneapolis event Sunday had no shortage of examples of threats to democracy. 
They highlighted the Trump administration’s deportations without due process; his attempt to unilaterally overturn birthright citizenship, which is the law of the land due to both the Constitution and longstanding legal precedent; his deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles; and the usurpation of Congress by restricting federal funds appropriated by the legislative branch. Speakers mentioned censorship and tacitly or explicitly forcing schools and companies to scrub their identities of diversity, equity and inclusion practices
Budding activists like Lacroix, who is interested in a county-level project bringing together elected officials and law enforcement, were joined by Attorney General Keith Ellison, Secretary of State Steve Simon and Rep. Emma Greenman, a Minneapolis Democrat — all known for policies that encourage voter turnout and fight disenfranchisement.
Ellison discussed his office’s ongoing lawsuits against Trump’s policies. For every Trump administration edict, it seems, Ellison has joined a lawsuit among his fellow Democratic attorneys general. The count is up to more than two dozen now. 
“I’m prepared to sue Trump as much and as long as he is prepared to break the law,” Ellison said. “I want you to know that I’m not tired, not worn out. We got plenty of gas in the tank, and we will keep going on this for however long it takes. If he tries to nationalize our National Guard, we will be in court.”
Simon told the crowd he’s currently in defense mode, as thousands of eligible Minnesotans  would face challenges to their voting rights if the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act winds up becoming law. It has passed the U.S. House but not the Senate.  
Because the law would require documentary proof of citizenship, Simon said some residents in expansive northern counties will face an hours-long trek to jump a new bureaucratic hurdle.
“They’re going to have to take half or more of a day off work to go register to vote,” Simon said.
Two voting rights scholars at the Brennan Center for Justice wrote that the bill “would devastate voter registration while disenfranchising tens of millions of eligible American citizens.” 
Greenman was instrumental in helping the DFL trifecta pass expansive voting rights legislation in 2023. Lawmakers extended the franchise to people released from prison but still on parole or probation. 
She delivered an optimistic message that though fear is contagious, so is courage.
“What we’re talking about is taking control of our communities, taking control of our families, our bodies, our collective decision making,” Greenman said. 
But despite Greenman’s optimism, the reminder of loss hung heavy in the summer air, all three elected officials had known Hortman for years, if not decades.
The Hortmans were killed in their Brooklyn Park home in the early hours of June 14 because of Melissa Hortman’s leadership and her support for abortion rights, authorities say. The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, was captured on June 15 after a 43-hour manhunt. He is also accused of shooting Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in their Champlin home. The couple survived their injuries and are recovering. Boelter remains in custody. Authorities say he had a list of targets, all of them advocates for abortion rights or actual abortion providers. 
“It is clearly an act of political violence that is able to fester in the current political climate, rise of authoritarianism and division,” said Lilly Sasse, co-founder and director of We Choose Us. “I think that added an extra layer of seriousness to (today) and the charge in front of us to take action and do something — and do it together.”
While the We Choose Us summit began with public speeches from state officials, the bulk of the agenda comprised private discussions about what a thriving democracy looks like and how to achieve it. Sasse said the thread between local, state and federal powers are clearer than they seem, and building relationships with everyone from county commissioners to congresswomen is a crucial element for success.
Sasse told Sunday’s attendees that rather than being quiet for a moment of silence, Melissa Hortman would have wanted residents to step up and take action. Which is similar to what the Hortman children have sought to encourage.
Sasse led the crowd in shouting “I’m ready!” in the late House speaker’s honor.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250617_0032-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-22 23:57:52.584871

Federal prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to appeal the decision. Both the decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and the notice of appeal were filed Sunday.

Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
Nevertheless, Holmes wrote, “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny to Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

Massie also criticized Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson for not calling the House back from vacation last week to consider a bipartisan war powers resolution filed by Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. 
“I think I represent part of the coalition that elected President Trump,” Massie said Sunday on CBS News “Face the Nation.” 
“We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East, and tired of wars in Eastern Europe. And we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies, and our infrastructure first.”
Massie said Iran posed “no imminent threat to the United States” and that Congress should have been briefed on the president’s plans before bombing attacks were launched on three nuclear sites. “The reality is, they don’t have a missile that can reach the United States. They’re not near to getting a missile that can reach the United States.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell commended Trump’s decision to enter the conflict that began June 12 when Israel launched air and drone strikes on Iraq, killing generals and scientists and bombing nuclear and other military installations. Iran has responded by firing missiles at Israel.
McConnell, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, said “seizing this opportunity is not an escalation toward war — it is a prudent response to the warmongers in Tehran.” 
“Israel’s bold response to the war thrust upon it by Iran’s proxies has created a unique opportunity to cripple Iran’s nuclear ambitions and strike a lasting blow to its hegemonic aggression,” McConnell said in a statement.
McConnell said the United States’ “interest in denying Iran a nuclear weapon, in standing with our ally, Israel, and in reestablishing credible deterrent power is undeniable and urgent.”
Barr, who is running to succeed McConnell in the U.S. Senate, wrote on X that critics of  Trump’s “bold and decisive action to defend the United States from a nuclear Iran are dead wrong. Apparently, they want to write Article II completely out of the Constitution. The President acted fully within his constitutional authority.”
On Saturday night after the White House announced the offensive, U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie posted on X: “Tonight, President Trump made a difficult decision that I believe was correct. In the end, Iran can never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. May God bless our troops in harms way.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers also applauded Trump’s action, posting on X that the president’s “bold military action has eliminated the growing nuclear threat from Iran, after decades of diplomatic attempts from previous administrations have failed. Disarming a nation that aggressively chants ‘Death to America’ from developing a nuclear weapon to annihilate us, is a victory for America and all our allies.”
Last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul told reporters he hoped Trump would not get involved in Israel’s war against Iran. 
The lone Democrat in Kentucky’s congressional delegation, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville posted on X: “The Constitution is clear. No president can declare war. On behalf of all Louisvillians, especially the brave men and women stationed abroad, I will fight to hold the Trump administration accountable for its decision to engage in direct military action against Iran without congressional authorization.
“Congress has yet to receive a classified briefing with evidence proving that tonight’s strikes were necessary to protect our national security. Congress and the American people deserve answers.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakotans are being held prisoner by their indecision about where they want to build their next prison.
After all the debates and accusations, it’s hard to know what to think about the project. It’s difficult not to be cynical watching lawmakers get all hopped up about spending $600 million. We’re supposed to think that’s a bargain because the original plan called for spending $850 million. So even at more than half a billion dollars, there are concerns about the new place being built on the cheap. 
Much of this consternation originates in the way the prison project was initially handled during the Kristi Noem administration. Neighbors of the Lincoln County project weren’t made aware that state land in their county was under consideration until plans were announced for the new prison. When they found out about it, their concerns didn’t matter to Noem, who was known for a my-way-or-the-highway approach to getting what she wanted. That initial secrecy in the governor’s office led to so much protest from neighbors, and so much rancor in the Legislature, that the original site is now deemed too politically toxic to host the prison. 
Prison group stuck between local opposition and limited space

As a taxpayer, and as a lifelong believer that government should be conducted in a transparent manner, it has been heartening to watch Gov. Larry Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset work group conduct public meetings as they have struggled to figure out the best, most politically palatable solution to South Dakota’s prison problem. It certainly hasn’t been pretty, but it has been a lesson in transparent government.
The work group has conducted a series of hearings about the project site. When they finally make a decision, they should hold some more hearings, this time to figure out how South Dakota managed to invest more than $50 million in the original prison site without having the official OK from the Legislature. Because officials jumped the gun, taxpayers are left with $50 million in plans and infrastructure improvements that may never be used for a prison and possibly never be used at all. 
The work group has yet to decide what the best location is for the new prison. Many sites have been considered, but the three still standing are locations in Mitchell and Worthing or sites where the Department of Corrections already has prisons or land in Sioux Falls and Springfield.
While the Worthing site may be, well, worthy, it’s also in Lincoln County. The opposition of Lincoln County residents has already killed one viable prison site. It may be in the best interests of the work group to consider that the toxicity at the original site extends to the entire county. 
Like the original Lincoln County site, most other sites in the state, no matter how viable, run the risk of upsetting the project’s neighbors as well as those folks who just like to be upset about something. 
There is already a not-in-my-back-yard movement in Mitchell, reminiscent of what happened in Lincoln County. 
“They didn’t tell us about it until after the fact,” Mitchell resident Barbara Stadler told South Dakota Searchlight at a recent community forum, in reference to Mitchell city leaders’ initial pitch to the Project Prison Reset task force.
The work group runs the risk of inspiring that kind of response with any new prison site they consider. That leaves the group with the choice to build new prison facilities on sites already run by the Department of Corrections. It’s hard for neighbors to make a NIMBY complaint about a new prison project when the prison is literally already in their backyard. 
As consultants have explained, building on or near current prison facilities is not the best choice. It may, however, be the most palatable choice for South Dakotans and the choice most likely to earn the endorsement of the Legislature.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240925_235057555-scaled-e1729719711486-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-22 12:07:09.802468

That sector still exists in some form, however, many of today’s cannabis consumers are “middle American” adults, employed, own a home, vote regularly, pay their taxes and are involved in their communities.
That is the general profile of adult cannabis consumers across the country and in Des Moines, according to a recent survey by Consumer Research Around Cannabis/The Media Audit.
The Media Audit, the parent company of Consumer Research Around Cannabis, is an international research company serving 80+ local markets in the U.S. and Canada for more than 20 years. It started gathering data about cannabis use and attitudes in 2016.

Although the sale of adult recreational cannabis is illegal in Iowa, the survey found 16.2% of all adults age 18+ in Des Moines said they used or bought cannabis during the past month, or the statistical equivalent of approximately 140,000 adults. The smallest percentage in the following table, monthly usage in Des Moines, is still substantial – and suggests a pent-up market. Unleashing the recreational cannabis market in Des Moines and all of Iowa would likely generate jobs and significant taxes for the state — money now escaping across the borders.

The survey data from Des Moines and 42 other markets was aggregated and showed 24.1% of adults 18+ used or bought cannabis during the past month. (Local factors affect these percentages and comparisons.)

For 15 years, Jonathan Caulkins, H. Guyford Stever professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, has been studying cannabis legalization. He is also the author of several books on the topic and a member of the Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis.
Caulkins’ research fine-tunes the results of the Des Moines survey from Consumer Research Around Cannabis. “From 1992 through 2023, the most recent year for which we have released data, the trend has been towards an enormous increase in the number of people who are using cannabis daily or near daily. They account for 80% of recreational cannabis sales. They dominate the market,” Caulkins said.
In states like Iowa that haven’t legalized adult recreational cannabis, Caulkins expects when they do, the middle of the market will be blue-collar high school graduates, adults 25–40 who are employed but not affluent.
He has also seen a gender trend as more states allow the sale of recreational cannabis. “As cannabis has become more legal, the male/female use gap has become noticeably smaller. When it was an illegal action or a risky action, there was a much bigger gender gap, but that gap is declining. Use by men is increasing with legalization, use by women is increasing even more,” he said.
Cannabis consumers in Des Moines also align with the 43-market survey when comparing gender and income. Millennials at 42.3% and Gen Xers at 35.5% account for three-quarters of the adult cannabis consumers in Des Moines who bought or used cannabis during the past month. These percentages are slightly more than the 43-market survey at 41.5% and 28.2%, respectively. The 33.8% of cannabis consumers in Des Moines with household incomes of $35,000 to $75,000 is also slightly more than the 43-market survey at 29.6%.
The Consumer Research Around Cannabis data also profiles cannabis consumers at a more granular level. The “household profile” category shows which three were the largest purchasers or users of cannabis during the past year, or 33.8% collectively.

Affluent, no children at home: $75,000+ household income
Affluent white-collar worker: Family income $100,000+
Affluent Boomers: $100,000+ household income

Comparing cannabis purchasers and users in Des Moines with the 43-market survey by their employment status and occupation reveals some contrasts. The data indicates that many in Des Moines are working and contributing to the local economy.

Voting is a meaningful measure of civic responsibility. Millennials at 22%, Gen Xers at 54.4% and Baby Boomers at 12% who purchased or used cannabis during the past month voted in local, state and national elections, compared to 33%, 32.1% and 24.6%, respectively, in the 43-market aggregate survey.
This particular data point may have ramifications for future legislative efforts to legalize adult recreational cannabis sales in Iowa. While the Iowa Legislature’s majority Republicans have rebuffed Democrats’ proposals to legalize recreational marijuana, advocates suggest time may be on their side if an increasing body of citizens support legalization with their votes.

The math would indicate it will be very difficult.
That’s likely why the party chose Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear as one of two keynote speakers at its annual Leadership Blue gala on Saturday night at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Hollywood (which actually is in Davie), the party’s biggest fundraising event of the year.
Beshear has proven that a Democrat can win in a red state, a formula Florida Democrats are desperate to figure out as GOP party registration numbers continue to increase each month. Beshear won re-election as governor in Kentucky in 2023 by five percentage points, while Donald Trump won that same state by 30 points.
“I’m living proof that if a Democrat can win in Kentucky, Democrats can win in Florida,” he proclaimed early in his speech.
He went on to say that Trump won the presidency last year because he convinced the last group of undecided voters that it was better to focus on lowering costs and addressing inflation than on “culture war issues.” That hasn’t exactly played out that way during the president’s first five months back in office, Beshear said. “It’s the opposite of what he’s doing right now.”
Beshear’s name has appeared on shortlists of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2028, as has the event’s other keynote speaker, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.
Earlier this spring, Booker spoke for 25 hours and five minutes on the floor of the U.S. Senate, setting a new record for the longest speech in Senate history.
He only went 30 minutes on Saturday night, but it was a performance. It began with him calling for the house lights to be put on so he could see all 1,000-plus attendees, and then he waded into the audience, ultimately standing atop a table to address the crowd.
“These are really, really scary times,” he said at one point. “And if you say you’re not, you’re not telling the truth. These are frightening times.”
Speaking to the Phoenix before the formal festivities began, Booker was asked whether he was concerned about the Democratic Party’s brand, which has declined to its lowest level in decades according to multiple public opinion polls.
“Leadership is about serving people,” he responded. “I think we should be less concerned about the Democratic Party and more concerned about the American people. I’m happy that my colleagues are looking not at what’s going to help the party, we’re fighting to preserve people’s healthcare. We’re fighting to protect people’s food stamps. Or their meals on wheels programs. This is the time to focus on the American people, leave the party and the partisanship for the elections coming up.”
He attacked the president, saying Trump was “coming to cut and gut vital programs for people here in Florida, and we need to do everything we can to stop him while at the same time showing there’s a different way to go.”
Bombs in Iran
Less than an hour into the event, Trump announced on social media that the United States had dropped bombs on Iran’s nuclear sites. While undoubtedly some Democrats were sharing the news at their tables via alerts on their cellphones, the incident was not publicly mentioned from the dais.
Booker told the Phoenix that he was supportive of Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine’s war powers bill, which would require a vote by Congress before the military could become involved in Iran.
“I’ve been very clear on supporting Kaine’s efforts that the president cannot declare war in this case without the clear constitutional mandate to come before Congress,” he said less than two hours before Trump made his announcement. “We should be debating that in the Senate. In the meantime, we need to be doing everything that we can to protect and support our ally Israel.”
Focusing on ‘core issues’

Beshear said in his speech that it was important for Democrats to talk to people, not at them. They can regain the faith of the American people, he said, by placing a “relentless focus on the core concerns of hardworking Americans.”
“Better jobs,” he said. “More affordable and accessible health care. Safer roads and bridges. The best education for our children and communities where people aren’t just safe, they feel safe. I believe that spending 80% of our time on these core issues shows that we are dialed in and we are going to deliver.”
In perhaps a nod to 2028, he made sure to highlight what he’s accomplished in his two terms as governor of Kentucky. That includes signing legislation just days after he was initially elected in 2019 restoring the right to vote for more than 140,000 Kentucky felons who had committed nonviolent offenses. He also acted to remove a Confederate statue, and he signed legislation restricting the controversial practice of conversion therapy (which the Kentucky GOP-controlled Legislature later overturned).
Despite his optimism, the reality in Florida is stark when it comes to the power Republicans have built up over the past five years. The GOP now enjoys a 1.3 million-voter advantage in party registration, their highest in state history. They also continue their supermajority status in both chambers of the Florida Legislature, and have held all statewide offices since Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried left her leadership of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in 2022 to run for governor.
Fried gave a 20-minute speech sandwiched in between Beshear and Booker’s addresses, in which she was candid in assessing the party’s branding and performance in recent years. “We know we are the underdogs,” she said. “We are up against a 30-year Republican machine. But we also know that change doesn’t happen overnight. It happens when we organize. Every single day.”
‘Brand is broken’
“Our message is sh*t,” she added, as some members of  the crowd laughed, with some applauding.  “Our brand is broken. But quitting, hiding, waiting, or whining will not fix it. What will? Showing up.”
She added that voters up and down the state needed to see Democrats “not just when the ballots drop, but every damned day.”
South Florida U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jared Moskowitz also gave speeches.
As is the case every year at Leadership Blue, Saturday afternoon was filled with various panel discussions — this time on school board races, voter registration efforts, and what people need to know about the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants taking place. However, unlike most other Leadership Blue events, the press was barred from attending any of these sessions.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Florida will hold its major summer gathering — the Florida Freedom Summit — on Aug. 2 in Orlando.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Biologists say Vermont’s loon boom is entering a new phase, which may mean lower levels of nesting success as the population levels out.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s adult loon population is at an all-time high, but fewer chicks are surviving.","A loon chick with its parents at Lake St Catherine in Vermont
Vermont’s adult loon population is at an all-time high, but scientists have noticed a recent decrease in the number of chicks surviving.
In 2024, Vermont saw a record-breaking 123 nesting pairs, 11 of which landed at first-time nesting sites. Out of the 125 loon chicks that hatched in 2024, 65% survived through the end of August, slightly below the 2004-23 average of 76%, according to the Vermont Center for EcoStudies. 
Eric Hanson, a biologist for the Vermont Loon Conservation Project, said the three main reasons for less chick survival are competition, habitat loss, and predation from eagles and other wildlife.
Flooding in Vermont in recent years has contributed to habitat loss and affected nesting success. Twenty-one nests were flooded in the summers of 2023 and 2024, a stark contrast to the one flooded nest reported during the drier summers from 2020 to 2022, according to the center’s 2024 loon season summary.
Nesting loons make their homes in smaller lakes when larger lakes are taken by other pairs of loons with established breeding grounds there. These sites tend to have more marginal habitat, often lacking protective features like marshes or islands. Nests built there are more exposed to predators, such as eagles and snapping turtles. Adults must also leave small lakes to feed in bigger areas where fish are plentiful, and the additional time spent away from their young can lead to their neglect, according to the season summary.
A higher presence of adult loons also creates territorial conflict, resulting in “turf battles” between loons that could prevent a pair from nesting, Hanson said. Chick casualties can also occur during these encounters.
However, lower nesting success rates are part of a natural process as the loon population begins to level out, he said.

“Loons overall are doing really well, and we don’t need to see success all the time,” Hanson said. 
Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department Biologist Jillian Killborn said this new phase is a balancing act on the landscape. After years of great success in increasing the loon population, slower growth and productivity is to be expected.
“With any wildlife population, there’s natural checks and balances that are built into populations when they start to get too high or exceed carrying capacity on the landscape,” Killborn said. Now, scientists are figuring out how many loons will remain in Vermont long term and where, she said.
Despite the drop in chick survival rates, Vermont loon chicks do better than those in eastern Maine, New Hampshire and the Adirondack region, according to preliminary data from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies.

Since 1983, volunteers and biologists have been gathering on the third Saturday of July for LoonCount Day, a survey of adult and nesting loons in water bodies statewide. On July 19, Hanson said he expects more than 200 participants to visit 175 lakes in Vermont to tally the number of birds. These efforts are important for tracking loon health, nesting success and the identification of emerging threats, he said.
“We’re just trying to hit everything,” he said. “We’ve expanded that out as loons start to land on smaller ponds compared to what they used to do.” 
In tandem with LoonCount Day, the Vermont Loon Conservation Project at the Vermont Center for Ecostudies organizes an annual loon monitoring program, during which volunteers take regular trips to lakes throughout the summer season to post signs in nesting areas and keep tabs on new and known nesting pairs.

The nesting signs respectfully ask boaters to give the loons a little space since they are highly territorial, especially during breeding season. If humans get within 10 feet of their nest and the birds feel it’s threatened, they’re more likely to abandon it, Hanson said. 
In attempts to curb disruptions along ecologically sensitive shorelines, Vermont passed one of the most protective statewide wake sport regulations in the country in April 2024. However, Hanson said kayakers and people fishing in boats close to the shore create more harm for loons than far-off wake boats.

“If we can give them that little bit of space, they’re more likely to hunker down and watch you go by,” he said. 
In addition to shoreline disturbances, recreational fishing poses another serious threat to loon survival. After a period of decline, loon deaths due to lead poisoning from ingesting tackle have risen again over the past six years, Hanson said. Ingestion of lead tackle, monofilament fishing line and fishing hooks remains the cause of more than half of loon deaths in Vermont.
Vermont banned the use and sale of small lead sinkers in 2007, but despite the ban’s initial success, loons are still ingesting poisonous tackle, according to Hanson and Killborn. To address the issue, the Vermont Loon Conservation Project partnered with lake associations and the Fish & Wildlife Department last summer to install lead tackle and fishing line collection sites at around 30 public boat access sites, which they plan to add to this year.

Responsible fishing, boating and recreation are vital to loon health and survival, Killborn and Hanson said. As Vermont’s loon population stabilizes, they emphasized that the next phase of conservation will depend on how well humans learn to share the landscape.
Either way, Killborn said loon numbers are increasing at a sustainable rate, and overpopulation is not yet an issue. “I’m not sure if we’ll ever get there, depending on conditions,” she said.

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.

“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”

Esteemed choreographer, activist and educator Katherine Dunham was born in Joliet, Illinois. For more than 30 years, she directed the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, the only self-supported black dance company in America at the time. 
She was often called the “Mother of Black Dance.” In the 1940s, Dunham’s troupe traveled across America, even performing in the segregated South. After discovering that African Americans were not allowed to buy tickets to one of her shows, she refused to perform. 
She received a standing ovation after a performance in Louisville, Kentucky, but following the performance she made an announcement that she would never perform there again because the manager would not allow black and white people to sit next to each other.

In this time of hardship, our administrators must show real leadership by cutting executive perks to save middle-class jobs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ellen Kaye and Claire Whitehouse: Amid federal chaos, will Vermont employers retain good jobs or reward their executives?.","This commentary is by Ellen Kaye and Claire Whitehouse, co-presidents of UVM Staff United. It is signed by 11 Vermont higher education and health care unions, listed below the text of the commentary.


On Tuesday, May 20, the dean of UVM libraries eliminated three frontline positions at the Dana Health Sciences Library, along with two other positions that are currently unfilled, leaving these suddenly unemployed workers and their library colleagues in disbelief and shock as the remaining staff scrambled to find ways to keep Vermont’s only medical library open to the UVM community, health care providers, patients and the public. And a week later, UVM’s associate controller laid off two employees performing essential regulatory work in the treasury services department.
UVM blamed these layoffs on the rising cost of health care, the federal government’s threats to higher ed funding, and, in the case of the libraries, the astronomical cost of journal subscriptions and databases. Yet UVM has chosen to retain many expensive budget line items, including raises for executives exceeding those negotiated by our unions, and we have heard that a multimillion dollar library redesign is in the works.
Our unions ask: why do our institutions cut good jobs and public services instead of addressing the root causes of rising costs? 
Across Vermont, too many of our institutions are responding to the rising cost of health insurance by eliminating jobs and reducing services Our state legislators just passed education reform bill H.454, which aims to reduce the rising tax burden of public education. Vermont’s health insurance premiums, which are the highest in the country, are a major driver of increasing education costs.
Earlier this spring, the city of Burlington laid off 25 employees in response to a budget crisis in part caused by the doubling of the city’s estimated employee benefits expenses. Investigations by the VT Health Care 911 coalition suggest that the primary cause of these runaway costs are UVM Health Network’s lopsided priorities: growing upper management jobs beyond industry standards while decreasing the number of employees engaged in direct patient care. 
The real question is: why do our public institutions and lawmakers choose to cut good Vermont jobs instead of acting together to rein in costs? Fixing the structural deficiencies of a broken health care system is challenging, but not impossible.
In the short term, we can start by confronting bloated executive compensation and bonuses at the UVM Health Network. In the longer term, we can commit to working together to enact a single payer health care system that more efficiently and effectively provides care for all. 
The cruelty and chaos of our federal government makes it critical for Vermont employers to do all they can to retain jobs. We have already seen many job losses in our state caused directly by Trump cuts: from federal jobs to federal contractors to the potential loss of programs like Northlands Jobs Corps. In addition to the Library and Treasury layoffs at UVM, several of our grant-funded colleagues have lost their jobs in the last month due to non-renewal of funding. 
Vermont cannot address the root causes of these federal cuts alone, though our legislators and our people power play an important role in facing down these threats. At the same time, it is essential that we pull out all the stops to keep decent jobs funded by state, municipal and private dollars.
To do this, employers and employees alike must come together to fight against corporate excess in statewide issues like health care premiums, and in industry-specific issues like the cost of journal subscriptions. And in this time of hardship, our administrators must show real leadership by cutting executive perks to save middle-class jobs.
At UVM, we are hopeful for an opportunity to change course. UVM will welcome Marlene Tromp as its next president on July 1. President Tromp has a choice: continue to opportunistically cut decent Vermont jobs and balance the budget on the backs of dedicated UVM workers, or invest in the people who make UVM work: in our expertise, our institutional knowledge, and our teaching and scholarship.
President Tromp can choose to put UVM back on track as a public good for all Vermonters, serving students and residents. Our unions call on her to make the right choice, and serve as a model for employers across Vermont.

A common whispered statement is, “Another flood and we’re outta here.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Jones: Gov. Scott, why do you want your capital city to become a ghost town?.","This commentary is by Dan Jones. He lives in Montpelier, where he has twice unsuccessfully ran for mayor.


Gov. Scott, your capital city is in dire shape. Montpelier’s flood ravaged downtown lives in fear of the Winooski rising again. Its infrastructure is wearing out fast, while the customers for its downtown have vanished and its local government lacks the resources necessary to address these multiple challenges.
So imagine, if you will, future visitors coming to our state capital and finding a crossroads of boarded up stores and restaurants, graffiti tagged on the downtown windows and a pervasive sense of sad despair. Is that the face you want your state capital to show the world?
This specter is far from the image that the city has recently enjoyed. “One of the best small towns in New England.” “One of the best towns for shopping.” Montpelier has long basked in these accolades promoting the glory of its charming warm community. This quaint visual facade projected a desired image of beautiful Vermont, where one could simply find the good life. Today things are changing fast, and it is time you paid attention.
I invite you to walk down the quaint Main Street of Montpelier today. Spend some time talking to the small merchants along the way. You’ll be surprised at the underlying apprehension they share.
All of them have endured overlapping crises for the past six years which have left them fearful and fragile. They condemn your failure to bring back state workers and a faltering economy make grim prospects. A common whispered statement is, “Another flood and we’re outta here.” In my discussions with business owners, I’ve heard people saying that they expect a number of other businesses to close later in the year.
Most of these folks don’t have the energy or the resources to rebuild and restart yet again. Of course, lots of Vermont towns face future destruction from their placement by rivers. The main difference is that Montpelier is your state capital. If you can’t help it become a showcase for how Vermont creatively responds to the certain knowledge of future disasters, how will those you want to attract have any confidence that Vermont cares for resilient innovation?
I fear you are trapped between a couple of your Vermont values. You are certainly the proponent of thrift, with lean budgets and trusting the private sector to fix things. Then, you give lip service to protecting our landscape and our citizens, but without commitment to actually doing anything concrete. 
Our perilous times are demanding visionary leadership, rather than partisan game playing. Climate change is real. Legislators, I know, bemoan your lack of vision and leadership while tussling with how to make policy in the face of your do nothingness. 
We are seeing the economy contracting rapidly as we sink more deeply into these times of continuing and overlapping crises. Some of us are hoping that perhaps our leaders could talk a bit more honestly about what is probable on the horizon.
In hopes that your administration could start attending to the threats facing our capital, let me briefly list some that seem evident, but maybe they aren’t.
The downtown lives in fear of another flood and without some serious aid (no longer coming from the feds) the next wave of water will wash away most of our restaurants and businesses. We need immediate attention to floodproofing our buildings. That will mean major foundation and support work, not just tiles and flashing. Antique buildings will require a lot more attention than newer structures built with flooding in mind.
Since you failed to demand state workers return to town after the Covid lockdown created remote work, once-predictable customers are not coming down to shop and eat. That, coupled with disappearing Canadian visitors and economically strapped tourists, means our merchants’ confidence in their businesses is failing.
Your state office complex takes up almost half of the most valuable real estate in our downtown, yet you pay a Pittance in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT). When I tried to bring up the city’s failure to get more during the last mayoral election, Mayor McCullough brushed me off saying they tried and didn’t get much.
So perhaps our less-than-persistent capital city’s leadership is also to blame for this failure. However, since all the state’s water, sewer, roads, etc. are provided by the city, it seems consideration is due. By the way, without rapid attention and support, the wastewater treatment plant, which also serves the state offices, is at risk from the next flood.
For a future that would create flood resistant housing and commercial spaces, there are places near the capitol that would provide significant opportunity. Without the long hoped for public monies and investment opportunities, we now need a more “Vermont way” approach that can train local labor, use local materials and start showing how to make a truly meaningful response to the ongoing decline.
The time is now to decide, do you want people in the future to say “when times got tough, there was Phil Scott,” or will they be asking (as many legislators do now) “when times got tough, where was Phil Scott?”

Biologists at the DNR’s Atlanta field office were first alerted to the bear’s predicament in 2023 through trail camera photos showing a cub with his head stuck in the lid. He proved elusive over the next two years, occasionally appearing in trail camera photos before disappearing after a day or two.

However, a Hillman resident captured the bear on their trail cameras in late May, and with their permission, DNR biologists set up a baited enclosure trap. The bear was safely caught on June 2, and anesthetizing the creature, they cut the lid off its neck and collected measurements and other data.
The DNR wasn’t able to determine how the young bear got its head stuck in a five-inch hole in the lid, nor where the lid came from, however a statement from the department noted the lid is similar to those on 55-gallon drums hunters use to bait bear, or that store materials like chicken feed that can attract bears.

While bear baiting is legal in Michigan, bait containers can only be used on private land and holes in those containers must have a diameter or one inch or less, or 22 inches or greater. The DNR encourages landowners to recycle or crush containers like empty cheeseball tubs, and to follow the Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies’ “BearWise” advice on securing their garbage.

“Container openings of a certain size can result in bears and other wildlife getting their heads or other body parts stuck in them, leading to injury or death,” Cody Norton, the DNR’s bear, furbearer and small game specialist said in a statement.“It’s important to remember that the opening diameter is more important than the size of the container.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Without being cajoled, threatened or begged, they fully funded education during the recently completed special session.","Give Mississippi legislators credit. Without being cajoled, threatened or begged, they fully funded education during the recently completed special session.
With little fanfare, they provided full funding of $2.97 billion or $16 million more than last year to the formula that provides the basics to operate local school districts.
That, famously, has not always been the case.
Through much of the early 2000s, the preeminent issue facing legislators each session was whether education would be fully funded. There were knock down, drag out fights about education funding.
Most times it didn’t happen. From 2005 until 2024, education was fully funded once.
But in 2024, legislators fully funded education and did it again this year in the special session that was held late last month.
When referencing the full funding of kindergarten through 12th schools, most times educators, policymakers and advocates are referring to the formula that provides for the basics of operating a local school district. The basics include items like staff salaries, utilities, transportation, textbooks and other items needed to operate a school district.
Starting in the 2003-2004 school year, the Mississippi Adequate Education Program incorporated the formula that determined how much money each school district needed to meet those basic needs.
The MAEP arrived at that dollar amount through an objective formula developed by education experts and put into law by legislators.
But after the MAEP was developed and passed into law, many legislators and more than one governor balked at fully funding it. They said it provided too much money for public education. There were multiple efforts to rewrite or even replace the funding formula.
Finally, in the 2024 legislative session, House Speaker Jason White, R-West, and his leadership team offered a new formula that would provide as much or more money for the schools than MAEP for at least one year. But the proposal removed the objective funding formula, leaving it to the whim of the legislators what full funding was each year.
Many educators and advocates balked at the idea of leaving the definition of full funding to lawmakers – many of whom had a history of wanting to underfund education. Some feared legislators would offer the big pot of money the year the MAEP was replaced, but in later years reduce the money, pulling the old bait-and-switch.
But a funny thing happened on the way to rewriting the Adequate Education Program. Senate Education Chair Dennis DeBar, R-Leakesville, backed by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, insisted that objective criteria be used in the new formula to determine full funding.
House leaders and Gov. Tate Reeves, wanting desperately to say they replaced the MAEP, yielded and agreed to the objective criteria for the new, simply named Mississippi Student Funding Formula.
In essence, the new funding formula is a lot like the old funding formula with objective parameters and a mandate for the Legislature to fully fund it, though the Supreme Court has ruled that legislators do not have to follow the law and fully fund MAEP. Supreme Court members would presumably reach the same conclusion with the new funding formula.
But legislators would look hypocritical to make a big deal of passing a new formula to replace MAEP and not fully fund it.
This year, we can give lawmakers the benefit of the doubt and say that they are excited about fully funding education.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/06164830/Ms.-Dept.-of-Education4.jpg,,,2025-06-22 07:58:55.080516

Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton will showcase more than 250 paintings of everything from covered bridges to clotheslines in a new wing under construction at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Historic trove of Vermont art set to go public in a permanent home.","A new wing at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center, illustrated here by the Richmond-based Birdseye architecture and building company, is set to open next summer.
MANCHESTER — Over the decades that Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton has amassed what Yankee magazine has called “the largest private collection of 20th-century Vermont art in the world,” the 83-year-old has hung his paintings at home, the office, seemingly everywhere but a single, permanent site.
Then Orton gathered them two years ago for a state tour that began at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center.
“This collection should end up here,” he recently recalled thinking about the arts center, “so my kids don’t sell it at a yard sale.”
Orton assured he’s just joking about his three sons, the third generation to run the family’s multimillion-dollar retail and catalog business. But he’s serious about wanting a place to share his more than 250 paintings in perpetuity. That’s why he’s breaking ground on a two-story addition to the arts center that’s set to open next summer.
“We are aligned with Lyman on the vision that this should be a public resource,” Amelia Wiggins, the arts center’s executive director, said of showcasing the collection. “We know the beauty of this area is such a draw, and art that captures it compels both locals and visitors.”
The new 12,000-square-foot wing is expected to cost $8.5 million, with related sitework raising the project up to nearly $10 million, according to a state land use permit. The building will be funded by a $14.5 million capital campaign that’s hit 90% of its goal.
“We’re not just constructing galleries, we’re creating space for freedom of expression and bold ideas,” said Bob Van Degna, president of the arts center’s board of trustees and, along with Orton, a top project donor.

‘What’s the story behind it?’
The wing now under construction is a full circle moment for Orton, who was 5 years old when his parents founded the Vermont Country Store in the nearby town of Weston in 1946.
Orton grew up in the unplugged days before the interstate and internet as artists working with oils, watercolors and woodblock ink “came up from down country” to capture the landscape and lifestyles of Vermont.
“They didn’t just pass through,” he recalled in an interview. “They started living here, painted what they loved.”
A group calling itself the Southern Vermont Artists displayed its work on the lawn of Manchester’s Equinox hotel and inside the gym of the nearby Burr and Burton Academy before purchasing the property that would become the arts center in 1950.
Turning 20 a decade later, Orton started his own collection, not knowing he was seeding a lifelong mission to “repatriate” Vermont art sold and scattered over the decades across the country and around the world.
When choosing pieces, Orton has looked for artists such as Luigi Lucioni, whose oils and etchings appear in the Smithsonian American Art Museum; Kyra Markham, an actress, painter and printmaker who was briefly married to the son of architect Frank Lloyd Wright; and Ogden Pleissner, nationally recognized for his Life magazine work and sporting scenes.
But Orton has ultimately focused on the art itself. Take Rockwell Kent’s 1926 depiction of Sunderland’s Union Church. Many see the canvas for its creator, whose works are displayed at the National Gallery of Art. Orton has appreciated it for memorializing the place his great-grandfather helped build.
“I look for paintings that have a ‘there’ there,” he said. “What is it? Where is it? What’s the story behind it?”

‘Art accessible to everybody’
When the collector debuted the traveling show “For the Love of Vermont: The Lyman Orton Collection” in 2023, he grouped both minor and master works into themes such as “Making A Living,” which pictured sugaring, slate quarrying and sawmills, and “Coming Together,” which portrayed families, fairs and ice fishing.
Amid paintings of barns and covered bridges, Orton has an affinity for depictions of clotheslines, be it Leo Blake’s circa 1940 “Summer Laundry” or Mitzi Goward’s “Out to Dry.”
“There is nothing more consistent with a Vermonter’s heritage of practicality, frugality and common sense than hanging the washing outside,” he said of the latter work. “Sunshine and the breeze are free.”
Similarly, Orton traded discreet museum labels for large-print signs more familiar in a school or senior center.
“That makes the art accessible to everybody, not just experts and Chardonnay sippers,” he said.
The traveling show included a postscript requesting “new, corrected or missing information” about the people and places illustrated but not necessarily identified in the art. In response, visitors from Manchester, Vermont, to Manchester, England, offered dozens upon dozens of comments.
“One woman left a card that tells it all,” Orton recalled. “She said, ‘Dear Lyman, I had to drag my husband to the show — and then I had to drag him out.’”
The state tour went on to attract crowds at the Bennington Museum, Montpelier’s Vermont Historical Society and the Manchester Community Library. But each location could only squeeze in a fraction of the full collection.
“It’s 250, 300, 400 paintings,” Orton said of the ever-changing total. “I’m not being coy. I bought 15 paintings in the last two months, just because things happen to come up. But because there’s so much art, it creates the opportunity to have a scheduled rotation.”
The Southern Vermont Arts Center is expecting to exhibit about 75 works in the new wing and keep the rest in a climate-controlled storage space for future viewing.
The addition, designed by the Richmond-based Birdseye architecture and building company, will include a second general exhibition gallery and a patio for outdoor events. But Orton’s collection promises to be the main draw.
“By being the highest bidder on the dozens of artworks of Vermont that Lyman Orton saw go up for sale at local country auctions, he made himself every Vermonter’s heir,” author Anita Rafael wrote in the collection’s 2023 catalog. “By keeping the art of Vermont in Vermont, it is tacitly being passed down to all Vermonters.”

The Sunnymede project and extensive legal fees have inspired controversy in town.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on June 19.
HARTLAND — Vermont’s highest court ruled in favor of a farm store planned on Route 5 near the Interstate 91 interchange, paving the way for the project to move forward.
In a split June 13 ruling, the Vermont Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Hartland Planning Commission and upheld a lower court’s decision that the proposed 9,000-square-foot Sunnymede Farm Store is permitted under Vermont’s Act 250 and the Hartland Town Plan.
Plans for the project include a two-story, barn-style farm store, deli and bakery with a 46-space parking lot on a property two miles from Sunnymede Farm. Both the 600-acre cattle and maple operation and the store property are owned by Florida real estate developer Aubrey Ferrao.
“My client is very pleased, but is also saddened that the good people of Hartland had to pay for this completely senseless appeal,” James Goss, an attorney representing Sunnymede, said in an email statement about the ruling Wednesday.
Ferrao bought the 17-acre farm store property in 2018 and the District 3 Environmental Court awarded Sunnymede an Act 250 permit for the project in 2023.
Shortly after the permit was issued, the Hartland Planning Commission and Two Rivers Ottauquechee Regional Commission filed an appeal that Vermont Superior Court Judge Thomas G. Walsh denied last summer.
The two planning commissions argued that the development constitutes “strip development” that extends construction along highways and contributes to sprawl outside of village and town centers, so it does not comply with Act 250. They also argued that it does not align with the town and regional plans because it is in a rural area.
Walsh argued that the development “makes efficient use” of space and infrastructure so it doesn’t constitute strip development. He also said that no provisions in the planning documents use strict enough language to deny the project.
After the first unsuccessful appeal, the Planning Commission forged ahead alone, appealing the Vermont Superior Court decision to the Supreme Court.
The commission’s decision to file the second appeal prompted some backlash and confusion from others in town, including the Selectboard, the Valley News reported at the time.
With no zoning code, development in Hartland is largely guided by state law and the town and regional plans. In its second appeal, the Planning Commission argued again that the farm store should not be allowed under Act 250 or the town plan.
The Supreme Court found that the project constitutes “strip development,” a change from the lower court ruling, but argued that because it is “agricultural in nature and unlikely to attract other commercial development” it is still allowed under Act 250, Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice Nancy J. Waples wrote in the decision.
The other piece of the Planning Commission’s argument was that the farm store is not allowed under the Hartland Town Plan because it is in a designated rural area.
Under the Town Plan, only “low density residential development” is allowed in rural areas, the Planning Commission argued. But, the plan also describes the area around I-91 as a “‘Rural business area’ and encourages further business development there,” according to the court ruling.
Because this language “is so internally inconsistent with the rest of the town plan,” it doesn’t provide clear guidance and can’t be enforced, Waples wrote.
The Planning Commission is “obviously disappointed” in the decision, but “we consider the case over with now so we’ll have to move on,” Vice Chairman Dan Jerman said in an interview.
For its part, the Selectboard did not issue a response to the ruling as a group, Selectboard Chairman Phil Hobbie said in a Thursday interview.
But, in his opinion, “the writing was on the wall when our regional planning commission, Two Rivers, decided not to make the appeal once they lost the first appeal.”
The town spent a total of $28,000 for both Sunnymede appeals, Hobbie said.
Lengthy legal process
The Sunnymede project and extensive legal fees have inspired controversy in town.
Early this week, Planning Commission chairman Dave Dukeshire resigned via email after posting about the project in the Hartland Listserv.
On Tuesday evening, other Planning Commission members “firmly” requested in an email that Dukeshire not post again until the Planning Commission could discuss the issue at an upcoming meeting because he had caused “inflammatory Listserv replies at a time when the HPC is trying to approve a new town plan and create a bylaw.”
Two hours later, Dukeshire resigned.
Moving forward, the Planning Commission and Selectboard are taking some of the lessons from the lawsuit into account as they update Hartland’s town plan.
The two groups and the regional planning commission are also planning to work together to write a set of unified development bylaws that will help to formally regulate some portions of the town plan, including for housing projects.
A contract with Two Rivers to work together on the plan was finalized in early June.
The town plan was originally set to expire in May but when a new town plan was not ready, the Selectboard voted to readopt the 2017 Town Plan in the interim.
“We did not want to leave the town vulnerable,” Hobbie said of the readoption of the old plan. Work on a new plan is ongoing and slated to be finalized in the fall.
Ahead of the May deadline, the Town Plan was “very close” to being ready for Selectboard review, but there were outstanding questions with the lawsuit still pending, Jerman said.
“We didn’t know how far we needed to take the town plan, so rather than pass something and invest all the time and possibly make a mistake if we got an adverse court ruling we decided to just put the other plan in place,” Jerman said.
Now, the Planning Commission is “wrestling” with how to include clearer language in the land use portion of the plan — a point that the Supreme Court said was lacking — and add language that will let them write other land use regulations in the future that they can enforce, like the unified bylaws or a zoning code, Jerman said.
As for the farm store, there is “no definite timeline” for construction yet because a “great deal of preliminary work” such as hiring contractors and other vendors for the project has to be done before breaking ground, Goss, the store’s attorney, said.

Ryan Farrington eyed the green and red bocce balls between the rails of his specially designed ramp, a device that looked like part of a roller coaster track. 
With his family by his side, the Rutland athlete pushed each ball down the ramp and watched them shoot across the grass as he tried to get as close as possible to the target.
“He is quietly observing, but he loves every second,” said his mother Michele Farrington. “It’s great to get to be a part of a team.”  
Ryan, whose speech is limited, nodded in agreement from his wheelchair.

The sentiment was echoed by players, coaches and organizers alike during the Special Olympics Vermont Summer Games last weekend. For two days, 12 delegations from across the state gathered at St. Michael’s College to compete and celebrate with athletes like Farrington. 
“We get to put the athletes’ talents on display,” said Susannah Kelley, a bocce coach and board member for Special Olympics Vermont. “More importantly, what we get to see is the teamwork that comes together and then, of course, the sportsmanship.”
The organization brought together some 500 delegates this year for the event, which is free for both athletes and attendees. 
Following the opening ceremony Friday, the Games kicked off with basketball and bocce competitions Saturday morning.  
Several bocce courts lined the field, with tents for each delegation set up on either side. Volunteers worked to track scores and organize the games, while athletes competed in teams of two to four. 
Brothers Matthew and Ben Spinney were at the Games playing bocce for the Chittenden County delegation.

“I have fun, and everybody gets gold medals,” said Ben. 
Jessie Huntoon, an assistant coach for the Central Vermont delegation, was standing by as athlete Jerry Weston faced Farrington on the bocce field.  
Huntoon has been involved with Special Olympics Vermont for over a decade. She initially began as an assistant for day programs before helping house athletes.  
“I fell in love with the people,” Huntoon said. 
She lives with athlete Rachael Skinder. The two go to concerts, Broadway shows and more. 
“We have a blast,” Huntoon said. 
Camaraderie at the games was not limited to bocce. On the basketball courts, teams competed together in hopes of winning gold. 
Athlete Jeremy Flemming from the Windham Wizards has been playing basketball for almost 30 years. 
“I love having fun with the team and being a leader,” Flemming said.

Jeremy and the Wizards went on to win their division. But winning wasn’t the only important part of the event. 
“I’ve seen athletes go from not wanting to socialize to dancing and meeting friends,” said Rhonda Mercier, head of the Franklin County Maple Leafs delegation.
The Special Olympics can also fill a gap for athletes with disabilities after high school. 
The national org runs a sports-centered program called Unified Champion Schools, which tries to make K-12 schools welcoming for all students. Farrington, the Rutland athlete, has been playing bocce for almost a decade and began in elementary school as part of the program. 
Kelsey Conway, a vice president at Special Olympics Vermont, has worked at the organization for over six years and seen firsthand how the Games can benefit athletes and volunteers alike. 
“The perspective on life that our athletes have is so inspiring and really, really helps to put things into perspective,” Conway said. “You’re with a whole bunch of people who are just happy to be there and happy to be living life.”
Special Olympics Vermont will meet again in St. Albans for the Fall Games on Sept. 14.

(Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – Every morning, to avoid getting sick, Jessica Baudean must take a long trip across the Mississippi. Baudean, who is disabled, lived in a tent near Tchoupitoulas Street until she received housing support in 2022, and now lives with her partner in an apartment in Avondale.
Beaudean and her partner, Terry Asevado, are methadone patients. Once heroin users, they now take a prescribed daily dose of methadone – a synthetic opioid medication which relieves them of their withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Baudean and Asevado say it’s changed their lives and allowed them to function. 
But to get the medication, the couple must travel for hours every day. If they can’t get a ride through Medicaid, Baudean must climb into her wheelchair and have Asevado push her 1.4 miles to the nearest bus stop. Then they spend an hour taking two buses,crossing the river to reach the only clinic on the city’s East Bank which is allowed to give them their medicine. If they arrive even a minute past noon, they miss their dose. If they miss a dose, they may be denied the next one. And if they’re arrested?
“Poor Terry,” sighs Baudean. “I know he’s still going to be sick right now.”
As the Trump administration cracks down on immigrants and hikes tariffs on Mexican imports, largely in the name of fighting the fentanyl crisis, a look at the experience of local people wrestling with substance use disorder suggests different approaches could be more effective.
Louisiana has among the highest overdose death rates nationwide. It’s also embattled by repeated disasters, internal migration and displacement, and poor public health support. And examples of effective drug policy under similar pressures can be found in a surprising place, far from the Gulf South: Ukraine.

Prison here, prison there
In a corridor within Strizhavka Detention Center, a medium-security prison complex in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, Iana Romaniuk smacks the glowing blue button of a vending machine. Inside, a sterile syringe tumbles to the bottom. 
“There are clean needles, lubricants and condoms” – and no cameras, explains Romaniuk, who works with Free Zone, an organization providing harm reduction services in Ukrainian prisons. 
“It’s new, installed 10 days ago,” she adds, with a hint of pride. 
Romaniuk, an unassuming woman with glasses and straight brown hair, spends her days advocating for the men in this sprawling prison complex and attached hospital. Though far from the frontlines, the specter of war hangs overhead. Security guards forbid photos of an old sign written in Russian, the language of their invaders.
The vending machine at the facility in central Ukraine is just part of one of the world’s most effective harm reduction networks, still going – and growing – after three years of war.

Harm reduction is a public health approach that emphasizes minimizing the negative physical and social impacts of risky behavior. It aims to inform and support, rather than punish, drug users. It can mean supplying clean needles and naloxone, which can reverse an overdose. And it involves testing for HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other diseases. 
In Strizhavka, about 3½ hours southeast of Kyiv, more than 25% of the 400 inmates receive opioid substitution therapy, or OST, just like Baudean and Asevado back in Louisiana. Here, a doctor distributes it in tiny paper cups from a pump bottle.
Since the prison began offering inmates free, clean syringes, it has seen zero new HIV cases. The prison even has a program that trains interested inmates to be social workers. Trained inmates support their incarcerated peers and can potentially work in addiction recovery after their release. 
The radically different approach is striking because, though 5,000 miles apart, Ukraine and Louisiana wrestle with similar public health challenges. Ukraine has among the highest HIV and intravenous drug use rates in Europe, trailing only Russia. Louisiana has the fourth highest HIV rate in the U.S., the fifth highest rate for drug overdose mortality and disproportionately high levels of hepatitis C, a viral infection commonly spread through sharing needles.
“Louisiana is very unique with its positioning,” said Ellis Lee, a former employee of New Orleans’ Syringe Access Program (NOSAP) at Crescent Care. “We have so many viral illnesses, historically, in part because we’re a port city.”
To grapple with the crisis, Louisiana has made some policy updates in recent years. New Orleans’ City Council decriminalized fentanyl test strips in 2021, and Narcan has helped slow overdose deaths. But drug policy in the U.S. South – and in Russia – has remained largely punitive, while Ukraine’s has grown steadily more progressive – partly in reaction to Russia’s approach.
The contrasts are many. Hypodermic needle exchanges exist all over Ukraine and are rapidly expanding. In Louisiana, needle exchanges are only allowed in East Baton Rouge Parish, New Orleans, Shreveport and Alexandria. NOSAP is the Gulf South’s largest needle exchange, serving over 2000 people in six months. There are no syringe exchanges in Louisiana prisons. 
The results speak for themselves. Before the war, Ukraine had seen an 81% reduction in AIDS mortality since 2010, according to the Ukrainiain Public Health Center, and drug overdose rates fell in 2021. 
Meanwhile, drug overdoses in Louisiana rates more than quintupled between 2017 and 2022 – from 401 to 2,376 – and hepatitis C infections are increasing, based on numbers from the state health department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since the war began in February 2022, Ukraine’s harm reduction networks have successfully pushed the government to expand services in light of the crisis. That’s partly how, as one incarcerated person put it, “civilization came to this place.”

‘The best way to torture somebody’
Beaudean’s partner, Terry Asevado, was arrested this spring in Jefferson Parish for bringing contraband into a correctional center. He’s still in jail because they can’t afford his $10,000 bail. Baudean said she knows he’s suffering because the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office does not facilitate prescribed methadone for people in jail. Baudean remembers a time she was arrested and cut off from her medication.
“I wanted to kill myself, straight up, but I didn’t have the guts to do it,” she recalls. 
Baudean remembers weeks of sleeplessness, being unable to hold down food or water, throwing up bile, finding all noise excruciating. 
“It’s the best way to torture somebody. Get them addicted to some stuff, and then put them in a room and lock it.”
Federal and state regulations permit jailed patients to receive methadone, but parishes would need to coordinate with the local methadone clinic to do so, according to Traci Perry, Louisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority. Gretna’s methadone clinic is run by Behavioral Health Group. They say they’ve never been contacted by Jefferson Parish Corrections, nor by CorrectHealth, the company that provides medical services for the jail.
“We would look forward to the opportunity to begin a relationship with them, so they can best serve our patients,” said Michelle Peres-Tenorio, BHG’s program director. 
Most correctional facilities bring in an outside contractor to provide medication-assisted treatment services, Peres-Tenoria added. The treatment typically involves a non-methadone medication for “a very limited amount of days,” followed by only over-the-counter medication, she said. “The staff is typically not educated on methadone treatment.”
A JPSO public information officer told the Illuminator the department has no policy on the matter and referred questions to CorrectHealth, which did not respond to queries.

Mobile outreach testing
Harm reduction also entails making sure people can get testing and treatment for illnesses associated with drug use. That’s why, inside a van parked near a Kyiv methadone clinic, behind sheer peach-colored curtains, Mykolai, an addicted man who declined to share his last name, folded himself into a seat at a tiny plastic table. Leaning in, Valeriy Timoshenko, a social worker with the Ukrainian harm reduction organization Convictus, helped him prick his finger. Mykolai pinched a plastic dropper to carefully take a few drops of blood, releasing them onto two HIV and hepatitis testing strips laid out before him.
“You’re living with a partner, so I can give you one to take home,” Timoshenko told him. The results of the tests – HIV and hepatitis – take a few minutes to appear. “If your results are positive, I will describe where you should go to get free treatment.” 
Mykolai, a 38-year-old former landscaper, handed Timoshenko a card. Printed on the card is a QR code that Timoshenko can scan to see how often Mykolai has gotten tested and some of his medical history. The card also qualifies Mykolai to receive a small payment – 100 Ukrainian hryvnia, equal to about $2.40 – for being tested. Mykolai also got five cards to hand out to friends, slowly building a kind of self-testing network.
Mykolai looked down, his expression neutral. The HIV test was negative, but he’d tested positive for hepatitis C. 
Louisiana does have some mobile outreach testing units. Some groups, like Below Sea Level Aid, also offer incentives when they can. But while Ukrainian police are forbidden from approaching the clinic or Timoshenko’s van, “police used to stake out NOSAP,” said Below Sea Level Aid founder Jack Waguespack, which he said deters the group from parking its testing unit outside clinics.

War, storms, and displacement
Already, there has been some exchange of expertise between Ukraine and Louisiana.
On a February afternoon, Velta Parkhomenko, project manager of the NGO Club Eney, a woman-focused harm reduction organization in Kyiv, sat before a screen as chatter from a sobriety meeting filtered in from the next room. Parkhomenko and another Ukrainian harm reduction worker were meeting online with two of their peers from Louisiana, who asked their names not be disclosed for fear of reprisal at their workplace. Talking excitedly through the screens, they ticked through some policy differences in their respective homes.
Perhaps the biggest: prescription parity.
In Ukraine, where about 20,000 people receive opioid substitution treatment, patients can go to government or private clinics for methadone prescriptions, get them filled at any pharmacy, and then take home a 10-day supply. Thanks to advocacy efforts, patients were given 30-day supplies during certain periods of the war.
“That is not how that works here,” one Louisiana worker said, startled enough to laugh. Patients “have to fight really hard to be able to even just get a seven-day take home” supply, they said.
Methadone is among the most controlled substances in the U.S., meaning it’s under restrictions that make acquiring it especially difficult for patients. In the event of a natural disaster, it has to be transported to impacted areas under armed guard.  
Just one methadone clinic exists on Orleans Parish’s east bank, serving more than 900 OST patients. 
Clinics are meant to hand out extra take-home supply before storms, but adoption of that policy is up to the discretion of clinics, and has not been widespread, according to sources familiar with the issue. During evacuations, there is no protocol in place for ensuring an OST patient has continued access to medication, nor gauging need – unlike, say, dialysis patients. 
Louisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority, part of its state health department, makes decisions about methadone dosing sites and transportation during declared emergencies, which then require approval from federal officials.
The divergence in policy is notable since Ukraine and Louisiana are both deeply familiar with displacement and evacuations.

Sitting in her office in a quiet apartment block in Kyiv, Tatiana Lebid wears a pink headband and sparkling eye shadow. She’s the founder of VONA, an organization for women who use drugs, as well as a recovering addict. 
She lists the effects of the war on her country, many of which will sound familiar to those who lived through Hurricane Katrina and other major storms: post-traumatic stress disorder, the destruction of medical facilities, a “brain drain” that’s reduced the number of health care workers, and a spike in domestic violence. Lost documents, displacement, unemployment and increased police encounters with curfews in effect are also commonplace, she said. 
Lebid herself was shaken last year when a drone dropped bombs just behind her apartment block. She recalled leaning out her window to try and see the damage, certain the bomb had destroyed her car. It was spared, but she has felt the fear that has driven millions to flee Ukraine. 
A major part of VONA’s work is to ensure people forced to flee can continue receiving treatment and support. They help Ukrainians replace lost identification documents and refer users to nearby OST clinics using a simple tool: a telephone hotline.
Lebid’s colleagues field calls from every region in the country, from prisons, and even from Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines. OST recipients were exempt from being conscripted into the military until March 2024, though some still are not draft eligible because of their HIV or tuberculosis status. 
Bodhan Protsenko, manning the phones, says the beginning of war saw a dramatic uptick in calls: 50-70 per day, up from eight before the war, he said. 
Protsenko pays special attention to the soldiers’ calls. He served a year and a half on the frontline and knows how hard it can be. Lately, he’s seen an uptick in soldiers using opiates. He isn’t surprised – the drugs can help with stress and sleep, he said.
‘I understand how to do this in a smart way’
Back in Strizhavka, Romaniuk leaves the vending machine behind and enters a small office. Yellow light falls over the wallpaper. Outside, an inmate chops firewood.
Advocates say prisons are where the need for harm reduction services, like clean needles, are most needed. Syringes on the black market can cost a hundred times more what they cost outside prison, which leads to reuse and illness. HIV rates are 25 times higher for the incarcerated. 
Needle exchange programs in Ukraine count more than 900 incarcerated clients and some 20,000 syringes replaced as of this spring. Before beginning its exchange program a year ago, the Strizhavka prison used to see a handful of new HIV cases each year. This year, they’ve seen none.

Oleksandr Lushnia, sitting against the wall and smiling shyly, is one of the prison’s incarcerated people who’ve been trained as addiction social workers. A former construction worker, he was put in prison about three years ago for stealing a bicycle. 
“Before this program, people could take dirty needles from trash bins – broken, dirty needles. Or they’d pay money to get clean needles, which meant they had to do different harmful things,” Lushnia said. “Now, people get infections less. I feel good. I understand how to do this [manage addiction] in a smart way, and tell other people how to.”
Lushnia took eight lessons in social work over one month, and was trained in how to administer Narcan and treat overdoses. He hopes to continue working in addiction recovery once released. Out of more than 400 inmates trained through the program, 77 have become certified social workers within the prison program.
And the war has only spurred Ukraine to bolster its efforts.
In fall 2022, Russian forces entered and occupied the southern city of Kherson, including the prisons there. Soldiers cut off OST, which is banned in Russia, for all inmates – then flaunted the decision on Russian state media. 
In response, Ukraine stood firm – and in fact further expanded OST services, from three prisons to 10, now serving more than 500 people.
Now, there are fears U.S. policy on opioid addiction treatment could become more regressive under the Trump administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has talked about “healing farms” or work camps for people with addiction, similar to the system once used in Soviet Russia.
Baudean would like to see Louisiana, instead, draw some lessons from Ukraine – like having more clinics, staffed by more counselors with lived experience of addiction, like Parkhomenko. There are formerly addicted people “that really changed their life, and they did the right thing and turned it around,” says Baudean. “So why don’t we hire the ones that did, to teach the ones that can’t?”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ukraine_0407-2-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-06-22 06:58:06.050290

Potentially jeopardizing them further is a federal proposal around habitat loss.,"Editor’s note: We now offer an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
“There’s a piping plover here somewhere,” said Corrie Folsom-O’Keefe, reacting to a faint peeping on a recent foggy, cloudy, on-and-off-rainy afternoon along Sandy Point Beach in West Haven.
And then after a pause: “Yeah, right there,” she said. “Oh, these ones might have chicks. There’s a pair here that had three chicks.”
The tiny white, black and gray shore birds move fast, darting up and down the beach. “These guys are maybe 14-ish days old right now,” continued Folsom-O’Keefe, who is the director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut, the state office of the National Audubon Society.
Piping plovers are a federally designated endangered species, meaning they are protected under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, ESA, enacted in 1973, which is managed jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in the Interior Department, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, in the Commerce Department.
Piping plovers are also probably the best known of the approximately one dozen federally endangered or threatened animal and plant species in Connecticut.
Folsom-O’Keefe said there are just over 2,000 pairs of piping plovers along the Atlantic coast — that’s Florida to Maine. In the current nesting season, there are roughly 80 pairs in Connecticut, and about a dozen of them have been spotted nesting along Sandy Point Beach.

To keep piping plovers safe during nesting season on Connecticut beaches, state officials and wildlife groups put fencing and a string perimeter around nests with signs warning the public. But with storms and sea level rise, tides can still flow inside the enclosures, as this shows with a tide line intruding beyond the fencing. Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel / CT Mirror
This year, as in every spring-summer breeding season, Audubon and environmental groups working with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have fenced the birds’ beach-level nests and erected perimeters with string to keep people from disturbing them — an act that is punishable under federal law.
But the fencing is no match for the impacts of climate change, which is causing rising sea levels and more intense storms. 
The evidence is clear this day. The residue from earlier high tide lines — wrack lines, as they are called — sits just outside some of the fencing around the nest, even pushing though it in spots, jeopardizing the habitat these birds need to breed.
Folsom-O’Keefe said a number of high tides and storms destroyed some nests right before Memorial Day. 
“The birds do re-nest, but then we have to re-setup 40 to 50 enclosures, which is this enormous amount of effort,” she said.

Potentially jeopardizing the birds further is a proposal by the Trump administration that in effect would mean loss or destruction of habitat would no longer constitute “harm” to wildlife under the ESA.
The law prohibits what’s called the “take” of an endangered fish or animal. The law specifically says: “The term ‘take’ means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” 
The administration summarizes the change it wants to make this way:
“The existing regulatory definition of ‘harm’ which includes habitat modification, runs contrary to the best meaning of the statutory term ‘take.’ We are undertaking this change to adhere to the single, best meaning of the ESA.”
“What the Trump administration seeks to do is to strip endangered species of habitat protections almost completely,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the national Center for Biological Diversity. “That’s quite concerning, because habitat destruction is the main cause of species extinction. You just really can’t protect and recover endangered species without protecting the places where they live.”
Indeed a recent article in The Conversation by two professors, Mariah Meek, a biology professor at Michigan State University, and Karrigan Börk, a law professor at the University of California Davis, provides the data to back that up. It cited a U.S. study from 2019 that showed that habitat loss or degradation caused far more species to be listed as endangered from 1975 to 2017 than any other factor, including outright killing. And it cited another global 2022 study that determined “habitat loss threatened more species than all other causes combined.”
The professors wrote: “Habitat protection is the single most important factor in the recovery of endangered species in the United States.”
Nearly 358,000 comments were filed during the comment period on the proposed change, which ended May 19. The Center filed comments, pointing out, as have others, that the Supreme Court has weighed in on the definition, ruling that habitat loss is valid.
DEEP also filed comments opposing the definition changes, saying it could reverse the conservation successes the state has achieved.
The letter reads in part: “Removing the protection under the ESA of critical habitat will only serve to further imperil populations. Further, removal of protection of habitat will also affect many other species that utilize said habitats, potentially leading to population declines in other species and listing under the ESA.”
It also noted: “Rescinding the current definition of ‘harm’ would also undermine habitat protections for all migratory birds and other game and non-game species that share habitats with listed species. Habitat modification is the most significant threat to nearly every migratory bird species in North America.”
Folsom-O’Keefe notes that many beachfronts along the Connecticut shore are narrow, which means limited space for birds like piping plovers with specific habitat needs. They have to nest above the high tide line. They need a sandy area with limited vegetation and a slope, but a shallow one. And they need to be fairly isolated without humans bothering them.
“Some of these species are so range-restricted that if we really want them to be able to recover, we have to protect not just the habitat where they are now but the habitat where they might be down the line,” Folsom-O’Keefe said.
If conditions push them out of their current locations, “where are they gonna expand to?” she wondered.
“I think the short answer is, ‘It’s complicated,’” said Jenny Dickson, DEEP’s Wildlife Division director, who signed the comments letter. “There’s a lot of nuance to it, so it can be really challenging to sort out.”
But she agreed that one event like a storm or flood or even a full-moon high tide can be devastating.
“That’s the challenge whenever you’re working with threatened and endangered species. There is already an incredibly delicate balance in trying to keep many of those species in existence. So one thing can dramatically change it,” she said. “But absolutely for those species that tend to be very specific in their habitat requirements, that habitat can be everything.”
The list
What most people know about nationally endangered and threatened species is most likely the big-name animals like polar bears, wolves, North Atlantic right whales, bald eagles and California condors. None of them are in Connecticut.
The federal list is in two parts — one from Fish and Wildlife and the other from Marine Fisheries. The Fish and Wildlife list contains more plants than animals.
The federal list for Connecticut is also in two parts — Fish and Wildlife and Marine Fisheries. 
But Connecticut has its own endangered species list based on the state’s determination. It is enormous, because it includes “species of concern,” as well as those that are endangered or threatened, and cross-references the federally designated species. The biggest category by far on the state list is plants. There are also a lot of moths.
The list is supposed to be updated every five years, but the current one is from 2015. Due to COVID, the 2020 update was never done. A review is underway now for the 2025 update. Any changes to criteria for federal species listing will not have an impact on how Connecticut evaluates species for its own list.
The state Natural Diversity Data Base, essentially a program that does environmental review for impacts to state-listed species, will also be reviewed as required by legislation passed this session, with the goal of updating the existing process to be more efficient, transparent and predictable. A report is due in February.
Not all the species on the federal list for Connecticut or the state’s own list are there due habitat-related stress. Most notably, bats are being decimated by a disease called white-nose syndrome. There are two on the federal list, the Indiana and northern long-eared bats, both endangered. The state lists eight.

Birds seem to get the most public attention, and habitat tends to be their key issue.
Besides piping plovers, there are two others on the federal list. Rufa red knot is a threatened species here. Roseate terns are endangered seabirds with three colonies in New England that constitute the bulk of the roseate tern population in the Western Hemisphere, according to Folsom-O’Keefe of Audubon CT. One of the colonies exists on two islands in Long Island Sound: Falkner, off Guilford, home to 30-50 birds, and Great Gull Island in New York’s portion of the Sound, with around 2,000. There are a couple more Massachusetts islands with populations.

Their habitat needs are an island that’s uninhabited and unforested and high enough above sea level so it’s not going to get flooded all the time. The birds also need plenty of food — in their case, fish, most commonly one called a sand lance.
“I think that really speaks to the habitat impact,” Folsom-O’Keefe said. If something catastrophic like an oil spill were to affect one of the islands, the population could drop dramatically. “It’s important to also protect other habitat,” she said. “The recovery plan for roseate terns is actually to try to get them to establish on additional islands.”
Another federally endangered species in Connecticut for which habitat plays a critical role is the dwarf wedgemussel. It’s a freshwater mussel that has faced habitat loss mostly due to the quality of some of the freshwater streams where it historically occurred, said DEEP’s Dickson.

Other endangered species include the puritan tiger beetle, which is only found along the Connecticut River and in Maryland. Its habitat is the sandier areas along the Connecticut River where it consumes other small invertebrates, acting as a control on them. The Atlantic and shortnose sturgeons are others, the former being a more-than-200-million-year-old species, feared extinct due to overfishing a century ago. In the last few years, however, Atlantic sturgeon juveniles have been found in the Connecticut River, leading to the assumption they may be spawning and perhaps living there again.
And then there are turtles: nine on the state list, six of which are listed federally. Some have aquatic habitats that may connect through multiple states. While habitat maintenance is important, they also bring up concern over what has emerged as a prime Trump administration tactic — non-enforcement of all manner of environmental laws and regulations already on the books.
“That is very concerning for us,” Dickson said. Connecticut environmental conservation police have to enforce federal law, but their powers are limited. And the state laws they can fully enforce generally are not as effective as federal laws.
“That lack of enforcement at the federal level is important, because if it’s an issue that might span state lines, that gets incredibly complicated, because we can only work within our jurisdiction. The federal special agents can work across state borders,” Dickson said.
For instance, bog turtles, which are federally listed, occur in Connecticut and New York in connected wetland habitats that are rare and very specific to that species. “If something occurs in New York that has the potential to impact the turtles in Connecticut, there’s a challenge there,” Dickson said. “We can’t address something that might happen across our borders.”
“Habitat is everything for that species.”

The politics
But wildlife, and really all life, exists in ecosystems in which changes have cascades of impacts. If warming oceans due to climate change sends certain fish into cooler waters, what happens to the birds that may feed on those fish? Or the marine mammals that may feed on them? If they follow the food source, will the habitat they need exist?
If inland wetland and aquatic habitats dry up, where do the species that live and spawn in them go, if they can even go anywhere?
“Those are some of the things that we do try to look at,” Dickson said. “What are some of the unintended consequences of other changes that are being made? If you change this thing over here, well, what does that do over there?”
The situation with the ESA also raises questions about whether the Trump administration will be proactive at any level on endangered species protection. The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned to have a Connecticut-based bird, the saltmarsh sparrow, added to the federal list.

That bird nests in salt marshes, but sea level rise often floods the nests, preventing the species from reproducing. An Audubon CT project in Stratford has installed higher mounds for the birds to use. It seems to be having some success, but it’s unknown how it will fare long-term as global temperatures continue to rise.
According to Greenwald, the Fish and Wildlife Service had said it was going to list the sparrow, but now, “I don’t expect that the Trump administration will move forward on it without us litigating,” he said.
He said the ESA is only one among several longstanding environmental laws the administration is looking to neuter — such as the Clean Air, Clean Water and National Environmental Protection Acts — along with individual rule rollbacks including on limits to chemical and insecticide use and more permissive toxic emissions that could harm wildlife.
Such efforts may compound the impact on species that may already be struggling from conditions caused by climate change and other factors like disease.
“It’s just a wholesale attack on environmental protections across the board,” Greenwald said. 
While loosening of many environmental regulations has been a goal of the Republican party for decades, many view the Trump endgame to be a glide path towards more oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other land uses without tough or even any environmental restrictions to slow or prevent them.
Connecticut does have a bit of a backstop, though, thanks to a few state laws, such as its own Endangered Species Act and a seabird and shorebird protection program.
Folsom-O’Keefe also points to the importance of local regulations in some communities, such as no fires on the beach, no ATVs on the beach, no dogs on the beach. 
“Those are all, I think, intentionally meant to protect people, but they also protect birds,” she said. “One thing we found is that a lot of the local police officers really know nothing about the birds at these sites. They don’t even realize they have federally threatened bird species here.”

So last summer, using money from its parent organization the National Audubon Society, Audubon CT piloted a program in Stratford to train police officers about the protected birds, their habitats and how violations of the local rules could affect them. For instance, if an officer sees a fire on a beach or an ATV, if it’s nesting season, the officer will know to check that as well.
This season, they’ve expanded the outreach, training and funding to West Haven.  
“Towns can look at what regulations that they have in place and maybe consider adding some more, or maybe upping the fines, or just enforcing it better,” Folsom-O’Keefe said.
If the Center for Biological Diversity’s Greenwald’s hunch is correct, that may be the only protection some of the birds get. 
“We don’t expect [the Trump administration] to make any changes or take the comments seriously. So I think that they’ll just plow forward with finalizing what they proposed,” he said.
Spokespeople for the Fish and Wildlife Service and Marine Fisheries both declined to comment on when a decision might come.
The Center is already laying the groundwork for a lawsuit. 
“We’re preparing legal action and fully intend to challenge in court and think that we have strong arguments,” Greenwald said. “But if they were to get away with it, we will really undercut how the Endangered Species Act has been implemented and how we’ve been protecting species for the last 40-plus years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Piping-Plover-fledgling-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-22 05:57:36.301882

They pair each show with a location to bring layers of meaning to the stories devised from scratch, inspired by New Haven history. Sometimes that means highlighting historic architecture or outdoor space in city parks, as they did during The Library Project in 2012 or Thunderbolt in 2009, respectively.  Many times  it means transforming an underutilized location into a newly reimagined space, like CitySeed’s new headquarters at 162 James Street in Fair Haven. 
“This year’s home-grown production [at the Festival] is a quintessential New Haven story. It’s about pizza. Or maybe it’s a story about immigrants risking much to settle in a new place. Or maybe it’s a story about survival, or maybe it’s about family. Or maybe it’s a story about life. Watch the show and decide for yourself,” said Kevin Ewing, Interim Director of Arts & Ideas.

FAMILY BUSINESS: (A) PIZZA PLAY, follows the multi-generational story of the fictional Carbonizatto family’s pizza shop (from the Italian for “carbonized” — a knowing wink to the black-dusted fingers walking out of any apizza shop) from it’s immigrant beginnings in the 1920s through the early 2010s. This production explores New Haven’s pizza magic (la magia dell’apizza) with over 23 actors of all ages and an equal number of backstage technicians bringing this charming history to life. Set against the backdrop of the city’s evolving apizza culture, the play explores themes of identity, inheritance, and the shifting meaning of home. Blending historical research with personal stories, it examines how food traditions both preserve and transform a family’s legacy. Jes Mack, Director and Co-Writer of FAMILY BUSINESS: (A)PIZZA PLAY explained, “My hope is that you, the audience, feel the truths of what we share in Family Business. Not only about the Carbonizzatto family, but also what it truly means to our ensemble to be part of a family business in New Haven.”
For FAMILY BUSINESS: (A)PIZZA PLAY, the all volunteer company partners with CitySeed, the steward of New Haven’s farmer’s markets, and Sanctuary Kitchen, who through their culinary training program and social enterprise, provide professional development and employment for new residents of Greater New Haven.  “CitySeed provides wraparound support services to food entrepreneurs like the Carbonizattos – from restaurateurs to food truck operators to caterers to packaged goods creators. Among them is our own Sanctuary Kitchen, a social enterprise run by immigrant chefs. By engaging with the stories of the Carbonizatto family and Sanctuary Kitchen, you support our vision for the future of 162 James St., build economic opportunity and strengthen human connections through the shared language of food,” said CitySeed Executive Director Sara Miller. By radically transforming this old factory into a place of performance, A Broken Umbrella Theatre has enlivened the raw space and brings awareness to the awesome work of these immigrant entrepreneurs and the ways that they make lives in Greater New Haven richer and deeply delicious. Sanctuary Kitchen will be selling pizza-style concessions before and after all performances of Family Business in the lobby.

(Mark McCormick for Kansas Reflector)The Greenwood Rising Center in Tulsa features a James Baldwin quote on its exterior: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”
It’s built atop the site where one of the nation’s greatest Black surgeons had hunkered down during terrifying nights of violence, only to walk outside the following morning, his gifted hands raised, to be gunned down by a mob.
During a recent tour in Oklahoma, with members of the Church of the Resurrection, we saw monuments and markers of two of the deadliest acts of racial violence in American history — Tulsa’s Greenwood and the Osage murders.
Despite Baldwin’s quote, nothing’s really being faced on that corner. Not in nearby Pawhuska, where the Osage murders unfolded. Not in a country where neo-Nazis and white supremacists continue marching with renewed vigor.
We remain in a perpetual approach pattern, where we descend but never land on justice. We measure racial progress in America by the pace of white acknowledgement, and during current Juneteenth celebrations, we should remember that freedom isn’t a destination.
It remains an endless climb.
A couple of weeks ago however, Tulsa’s Greenwood district and Pawhuska marked destinations for the Adult Discipleship Ministry billed by the group’s leader and my dear friend, the Rev. Robert Johnson, as definitely “not a vacation.”
This “human rights immersion” trip, inspired by church Senior Pastor Adam Hamilton, sold out online in 43 minutes, which spoke to the earnest desires of the group to learn how discipleship must have social as well as personal expressions.
“You will be expected to engage in intense learning and discipleship-building exercises,” Johnson’s preparatory missive to the group read.
Johnson’s lovely wife, Linda, kept us on pace for all our stops.
We saw monument after monument in Tulsa.
We saw a statue of the iconic historian John Hope Franklin, the son of a prominent Greenwood lawyer who had written real-time notes of black, fiery, turpentine balls dropping from planes strafing the 36-BLOCK, Black business district.
We gathered around solemn black monuments in front of the Greenwood Cultural Center that offered a register of Black businesses destroyed. We paused over rectangular plaques embedded in the sidewalks in front of the only remaining buildings from old Greenwood.
We saw murals and remembrances under the Interstate 244 bridge that state and local officials drove through the heart of Greenwood, intent on strangling the vaunted business district. We saw the refurbished Mt. Vernon Baptist Church, burned in the massacre.
Our Greenwood tour guide, Kode Ransom, explained deeply and deftly what rarely garners mention in the massacre’s lore.
Ransom said that by 1933, Greenwood had rebuilt itself, only to have I-244 and urban renewal destroy much of what had been rebuilt. He mentioned that no white death toll existed, nor identification of a single white looter or rapist.

After a day and an evening in Greenwood, we moved an hour northeast to Pawhuska, the site of the Osage murders resurrected by David Gann’s book and the Martin Scorsese film, “Killers of the Flower Moon.”
The book and film detail the theft of wildly profitable oil rights from Osage people. The Osage selected the rocky, barren land as a barrier to white interest, but those hopes died, as did many Osage, when oil was discovered there.
Historians often teach the Greenwood massacre and the Osage murders in tandem since they occurred in roughly the same area, in the same era, each with white greed and envy fueling orgies of violence.
Outside the Osage Nation Museum, we saw still more monuments.
We saw a granite memorial for the Osage veterans with a giant feather in the center. Another monument rose from the ground like a huge headstone with etchings saying the petroleum industry had gifted the slab.
Another nearby featured a seated, majestic Chief Claremore, weapons in each hand.
The monuments — from Greenwood to Pawhuska — harkened Carl Hines Jr.’s words: “Dead men make such convenient heroes for they cannot rise to challenge the images we would fashion from their lives and besides, it is easier to build monuments than to build a better world.”
Bodies likely remain under a new baseball field in Greenwood. Many more bodies have not been discovered. Killers dumped still more in the cloudy brown Arkansas River.
Society’s response?
You can have all the museums and monuments you want, just don’t ask for justice. This process of misremembering and denial is designed to preserve the innocence of one group, at the expense of another.
It’s a pattern visible since the Confederacy’s “Lost Cause” narrative after the Civil War. Look closely, and there’s a bloody thread running from the Appomattox Courthouse to Greenwood, to a dozen other massacres, to George Floyd, to Jan. 6, 2021.
Deny the obvious and blame the victims.
“The Civil War wasn’t about slavery.” “The slaves were happy.” Calling the Civil War the “war of northern aggression.” “Black men (trying to prevent the lynching of a falsely accused man) started the Greenwood Massacre.” “George Floyd was a drug addict.” “Jan. 6 was a day of love.”
Then, attempt to erase evidence. Rip out newspaper accounts. Refuse to teach it in schools. Pardon participants. Never speak of what happened. When that doesn’t work, willfully misremember it.
When that doesn’t work, argue the pointlessness of rehashing the past, but eventually, while denying any culpability or remuneration, grudgingly grant the smallest modicum of acknowledgement: a monument. Then relax as grief and terror get monetized.
Wash, rinse, repeat.
This has remained true even of Juneteenth, the supposed date when Texas’ enslaved people learned about their freedom. But enslaved people knew already. It was the people who “owned” people who were learning they could no longer keep people hostage.
This is the cycle Pastor Adam, the Rev. Robert and Linda wanted to shatter with the human rights tour. On the trip back, I offered another James Baldwin quotation: “To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger.”
So no, freedom can’t be a destination.
It’s a perpetual climb because seemingly, there always will be resistance.

But there’s a lot of unfinished business on the transportation front worth remembering.,"The end of June has a sense of finality.  School wraps up, celebratory parties are held and everyone looks forward to the summer.  But there’s a lot of unfinished business on the transportation front worth remembering.
AMTRAK AVELIA: Whatever happened to Amtrak’s promise to have the new Acela trains in service “by the Spring?” The initial contract for 28 train sets was signed in 2016 with the first prototype of the sleek nine-car sets delivered for testing in 2020.  The plan was for all the new trains to be running between Washington and Boston by 2022.


Computer simulations found problems as real life testing continued. By 2024 the hope was for the new trains to be running by now.  But we’re still waiting.  Amtrak’s only explanation for the latest delays is “crew testing.” 
The new trains have been sighted in New Jersey (where maximum speeds of 160 mph are possible on short stretches of track) but I’ve not seen Avelia on Connecticut tracks… yet.
DIGITAL DRIVERS LICENSES: In September 2021 the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles and Gov. Ned Lamont announced that ours would be among the first states to allow smartphone users to show a digital version of their driver’s license on their devices.  To date, 17 states offer such options.  But still not Connecticut.
When I last asked DMV what was delaying the launch, their PR team gave me some boilerplate answer about “testing” and “security”… but no announced date for the launch.
How can California have solved those issues but we can’t?
WALK BRIDGE:  Built in 1896, this crucial rail bridge in South Norwalk has a history of problems.  In one year alone the bridge was stuck 16 out of 271 times it opened.  Now it’s undergoing a $1.5 billion rebuild, not just of the bridge but its supports and nearby tracks.

The IMAX theater in the adjacent Maritime Museum was demolished to make way, but work on the bridge structure itself is still years away.  The removal of the existing tower structure for overhead wires is scheduled to begin in 2026 with the new bridge (finally!) being finished in 2029.
DARIEN TRAIN STATION:  Last rebuilt in 2003, the station’s platforms were starting to crumble.  By 2018 it was clear that the Connecticut Department of Transportation would have to replace them. The $40 million contract called for first-of-their-kind heated platforms, obviating the need for corrosive salt to melt ice and snow.  Half of the platforms were removed and the station waiting room was closed.
But now, years later, construction delays and problems with the electrical system have slowed the work, initially promised to be done by now.  It’s hoped the first half of the new platforms may be ready later this summer.  Then the other half of the platforms will be demolished and rebuilt.  By March 2026 the work will (hopefully) be done and the station’s 1,800+ daily commuters will be able to use the new station platforms.
Engineering projects take time.  But with every ceremony celebrating the launch of a new project there are overly-optimistic promises of speedy completion.  The politicians take the credit while we just wait and grow more cynical watching the costs rise.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Darien-station-constructionequipmentguide-dot-com-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-22 04:58:48.157650

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Less than an hour after President Donald Trump announced that the United States had bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities, Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said he supported the decision.
In a written statement posted on the social media site X, Sullivan said he commends the president.
“The terrorist leaders of Iran have, in essence, been at war with the United States for decades — targeting, wounding and killing thousands of American service members for years,” Sullivan wrote.
Sullivan, a former Marine Corps officer, has repeatedly called for aggressive actions against Iran, particularly amid Iran’s support of anti-American militias during the Iraq War. Five years ago, he supported Trump’s decision to assassinate an Iranian general in Iraq.
Sullivan and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, previously supported Trump’s decision in 2018 to withdraw from a diplomatic agreement intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
International experts and Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence under Trump, have said that no evidence has been produced showing that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.
Trump himself has said he does not believe Gabbard, and Sullivan, a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, spoke this week in that committee, implying that he would support military action in order to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
He reiterated that position after the Trump-ordered bombing.
“Making sure the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism never gets a nuclear weapon is part of the work of reestablishing deterrence against Iran, which was lost during the appeasement of the Biden Administration. This is difficult work, but critical for our national security. I fully support the President and his national security team in these critical efforts,” he wrote.
A spokesperson for Murkowski said she did not have an immediate comment.
Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, spoke about Iran during an interview Friday, one day before the Trump-ordered bombing.
During the interview, he said he had no special knowledge about what would happen in the coming weeks and months but viewed the situation as Iran’s to settle.
“I think the ball is at this moment in Iran’s court: Do they want to be a member of the international community or not? And what’s been made clearly, not just by the United States, but many of our friends and allies around the world, is that we cannot allow them to become a nuclear-armed nation,” Begich said. 
“We don’t need another nation, particularly a nation like Iran, to gain the ability to attack with nuclear weapons. We’ve already seen they have hypersonics and are willing to use those. A nuclear-tipped hypersonic would be very difficult to intercept, and it creates an asymmetric capability in a nation that has made quote, “Death to Israel” and “Death to America,” official policy. And when you have a nation saber-rattling like that on a regular basis, actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it’s a dangerous situation, not just for Israel, not just for the United States, but for the entire world,” he said.

The audit question amounts to an act of constitutional vandalism, an example of the mischief that can result from Article 48, and why this seems a good time to consider amending the initiative process.
The post The century-old flaw that let Question 1 go the ballot   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT SHOULD NOT be surprising that, last year, 71 percent of Massachusetts voters endorsed the ballot initiative designated as Question 1. That measure granted the Office of State Auditor the authority to audit the state Legislature, without its consent, with the aim of enhancing legislative transparency and accountability.  
Who would be opposed to more transparency and accountability? The problem is that the law is almost certainly unconstitutional. It lays waste to the principle of legislative independence by undermining both the separation of powers and the constitutional grant of authority to each chamber of the General Court to control its internal rules and procedures.  
Nonetheless, state Auditor Diana DiZoglio continues to maintain that the voter-approved law grants her the authority to audit the Legislature as she might a state agency. She has submitted audit requests and complained in public about the failure of each legislative branch to respond; at the same time, the attorney general has yet to approve any kind of enforcement action on the auditor’s behalf. 
In our judgment, the audit question amounts to an act of constitutional vandalism, irrespective of the merits of the policies and sentiments that led to its approval. It is an example of the mischief that can result from the initiative process set out in Article 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution, and why this seems a good time to consider amending the initiative process to prevent future politicians and activists from accomplishing constitutional change “on the cheap” and thereby weakening (intentionally or not) the integrity of the oldest written constitution in the world. 
Proposed and ratified more than a century ago, Article 48 represented a progressive effort designed to close the distance between public opinion and public policymaking outcomes. Lawmaking through direct democracy was intended to allow the people to engage in a more dynamic form of lawmaking, one capable of meeting the needs of a rapidly changing world.  
But the framers of Article 48 did not seek to jettison the commitments that animate the original 1780 constitution—not least of which was the principle of separation of powers, which John Adams believed crucial to effective democratic governance.  
Article 48 therefore includes a list of “excluded matters”—constitutional provisions that cannot be changed by popular vote. Initiative proposals accordingly must be reviewed by the attorney general before being allowed on the ballot to ensure that they do not address “excluded matters.”  
The list of such matters reflects what the Article 48 framers saw, in 1918, as constitutional guarantees vulnerable to challenge at the polls on Election Day, where the constitutional checks and balances that safeguard representative democracy are not front and center. Excluded matters include those that seek to make a specific appropriation of money from the state treasury or that relate to the right to trial by a jury, the freedoms of speech and the press, or the right to peaceable assembly.  
At the time of Article 48’s adoption, neither legislative independence, nor the separation of powers that facilitates it, were thought to be particularly vulnerable. Both remain exceptionally resilient in Massachusetts.  
As a result, when the audit initiative came before the attorney general for review under Article 48, that office could not act on the measure’s obvious constitutional problem because the “excluded matters” do not specifically include the authority of each branch of the Legislature to control its own functioning.  
The framers of Article 48 could not have imagined the ways in which determined activists today can pull together support for initiative efforts far more quickly and easily than in 1918, and that such efforts might well be fueled by fundamental misunderstandings about how government works—if not outright misinformation. In such an environment, Article 48’s framers likely would have appreciated the need to protect a core component of John Adams’s vision for representative government in the Commonwealth—namely, that legislators should be beholden, first and foremost, to their constituents, and that executive branch officers should not have the power to interfere with the legislature’s basic functioning.  
There may well be other core principles in the Massachusetts Constitution that should qualify today as “excluded matters,” but the audit question directly implicates two provisions that are vital to legislative functioning and the separation of powers:  Part II, chapter I, section 2, article 7, which authorizes the Senate to “choose its own president, appoint its own officers, and determine its own rules of proceedings”; and Part II, chapter I, section 3, article 10, which provides the same for the House of Representatives.  
By amending the state constitution to exclude these provisions from modification or alteration through direct democracy under Article 48, the Legislature can be protected from efforts to impede the long-established ability of senators and representatives to represent the people of the Commonwealth.  
Indeed, the critical importance of these provisions to the functioning of the Legislature has been recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court. In a case called Paisner v. Attorney General, the court concluded that the authority of each house to manage its own affairs “is a continuous power absolute and beyond the challenge of any other tribunal.”  
In addition to providing the authority for lawmaking by initiative, Article 48 spells out the means by which the constitution itself can be amended, a process that turns on approval by voters and the Legislature.  
It is time to engage this process to secure the Legislature’s independence from the vicissitudes of proposals animated by the popular sentiment of the moment, rather than by the view embraced by Adams and the framers almost 250 years ago—that the people themselves stand as the best check on their elected representatives.

Tim Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy Seal and Montana’s junior senator, praised the Trump administration’s announcement Saturday it had bombed three nuclear sites in Iran.
“The right decision,” said Sheehy, a Republican from Bozeman, in a social media post. “Iran had every opportunity to give up their nukes. To the naysayers out there, this isn’t starting a war, this is ending one. Iran has been at war with America for 46 years. The Iranian people should rise up and put an end to this murderous regime.”
U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, also a Republican, reposted a social media message from President Donald Trump, adding four American flags. He posted a subsequent message on social media with the following:
“Thank you President Trump and the men and women of our armed forces,” Daines said in the post. “America, Israel and the rest of the world are safer tonight as a result of your bravery, courage and unrivaled skill. Iran is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, has killed hundreds of U.S. service members, attempted to assassinate President Trump and calls the United States ‘Big Satan’ and Israel ‘little Satan.’ Stopping Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons is a major step toward achieving peace.”
President Trump said Saturday night that the United States attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, and all U.S. planes were outside Iran and on their way back to the United States, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau reported.
“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said on social media.
“All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he wrote.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, also a former U.S. Navy Seal and Republican, and U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, a Republican formerly with the U.S. Air Force, did not have statements immediately posted to their social media sites and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An automatic message from a spokesperson for Zinke’s office said the spokesperson was out of the country with no access to email, and the Daily Montanan did not receive an immediate reply from the recommended contact.
Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte did not weigh in on the bombing in a social media post reposting a message from the White House with the news, but he offered a message to soldiers, the president and country: “God bless our armed forces. God bless President Trump. God bless America.”
In a phone call, military veteran and Montana Senate President Pro Tempore Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, expressed concerns about the action and aftermath.
“As a Marine who fought in Iraq, I’ve seen firsthand the cost of war in the Middle East, both in lives, in taxpayer dollars, and long-term consequences,” said Bogner, who spent four years with the U.S. Marines Corps and was twice deployed to Iraq. “I don’t know why we need to get involved in this. Our involvement just opens up the possibility of another endless war. I don’t want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, but this is Israel’s fight. It’s not ours.”
In Montana, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls controls 150 nuclear warheads. Bogner said he doesn’t believe the decision will directly impact Montanans in the state, but it could impact those serving abroad.
“But if there are Montanans overseas on military bases, this could impact them if Iran wants to retaliate. That’s where I have concerns.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-21 21:58:39.827010

Jim Himes condemns attack,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/21/trump-iran-strikes-ct-himes/,"President Trump said U.S. military struck three sites in Iran Saturday, joining Israel’s effort to decapitate the country’s nuclear program.","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel ’s effort to decapitate the country’s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran’s threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict.
There was no immediate acknowledgment from the Iranian government of any strikes being carried out. The country’s state-run IRNA news agency early Sunday reported an attack on the country’s Fordo nuclear site that activated air defenses. The agency did not elaborate.
The decision to directly involve the U.S. in the war comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran that aimed to systematically eradicate the country’s air defenses and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. But U.S. and Israeli officials have said that American stealth bombers and the 30,000-pound (13,500-kilogram) bunker buster bomb they alone can carry offered the best chance of destroying heavily fortified sites connected to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground.
“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said in a post on social media. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.”
Trump added in a later post that he would address the national at 10 p.m. Eastern time, writing “This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!”
Trump said B-2 stealth bombers were used but did not specify what types of bombs were dropped. The White House and Pentagon did not immediately elaborate on the operation.
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, who represents Connecticut’s 4th congressional district, called the action “a clear violation of the Constitution” in a statement late Saturday. Himes said only Congress has the power to declare war.
“It is impossible to know at this stage whether this operation accomplished its objectives,” he said in the statement. “We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East.” 
Himes, who plays a key role in overseeing the intelligence community and threats to the U.S. as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was “continuing to closely monitor the situation and demand answers from the Administration.”
The strikes are a perilous decision, as Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, and for Trump personally. He won the White House on the promise of keeping America out of costly foreign conflicts and scoffed at the value of American interventionism.
Trump told reporters Friday that he was not interested in sending ground forces into Iran, saying it’s “the last thing you want to do.” He had previously indicated that he would make a final choice over the course of two weeks.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the United States on Wednesday that strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.” And Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei declared “any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.”
Trump has vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, and he had initially hoped that the threat of force would bring the country’s leaders to give up its nuclear program peacefully.
The Israeli military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. attack that American military involvement “would be very, very dangerous for everyone.”
The prospect of a wider war loomed. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joined Israel’s military campaign. The Houthis paused such attacks in May under a deal with the U.S.
The U.S. ambassador to Israel announced that the U.S. had begun “assisted departure flights,” the first from Israel since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war in Gaza.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Trump planned to make his decision on the strikes within two weeks. Instead, he struck just two days later.
Trump appears to have made the calculation — at the prodding of Israeli officials and many Republican lawmakers — that Israel’s operation had softened the ground and presented a perhaps unparalleled opportunity to set back Iran’s nuclear program, perhaps permanently.
The Israelis say their offensive has already crippled Iran’s air defenses, allowing them to already significantly degrade multiple Iranian nuclear sites.
But to destroy the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, Israel appealed to Trump for the bunker-busting American bomb known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets and then explode. The bomb is currently delivered only by the B-2 stealth bomber, which is only found in the American arsenal.
If deployed in the attack, it would be the first combat use of the weapon.
The bomb carries a conventional warhead, and is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility.
Previous Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.
Trump’s decision for direct U.S. military intervention comes after his administration made an unsuccessful two-month push — including with high-level, direct negotiations with the Iranians — aimed at persuading Tehran to curb its nuclear program.
For months, Trump said he was dedicated to a diplomatic push to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. And he twice — in April and again in late May — persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on military action against Iran and give diplomacy more time.
The U.S. in recent days has been shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel and U.S. bases from Iranian attacks.
All the while, Trump has gone from publicly expressing hope that the moment could be a “second chance” for Iran to make a deal to delivering explicit threats on Khamenei and making calls for Tehran’s unconditional surrender.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump said in a social media posting. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”
The military showdown with Iran comes seven years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-administration brokered agreement in 2018, calling it the “worst deal ever.”
The 2015 deal, signed by Iran, U.S. and other world powers, created a long-term, comprehensive nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
Trump decried the Obama-era deal for giving Iran too much in return for too little, because the agreement did not cover Iran’s non-nuclear malign behavior.
Trump has bristled at criticism from some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon […]","A carbon dioxide (CO2) injection well drilled by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy) at the Cranfield CO2 test site in Mississippi. (USGS)PIERRE, S.D. – Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said.
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, sent a similar reply that did not disclose his position on the tax credits.
“As congressional Republicans work with President Trump to pass legislation that will create long-term strength, safety, and prosperity for America, Sen. Thune appreciated the opportunity to meet with and hear firsthand from state legislators who have been on the front lines of this issue.”
Anti-pipeline activists are also concerned about a provision in an early draft of the House budget reconciliation bill that they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law. That provision was removed before the bill passed the House. The rest of the statement from Thune’s office appeared to address that issue: “He understands their concerns, and he conveyed that the provision removed by the House is unlikely to be included in the final bill.”

(Photo by Dennis Schroeder/NREL)For decades, federal support for renewable energy largely excluded Alaska while building new energy opportunities and capacity in the Lower 48. Nonprofit cooperatives, which generate nearly all of Alaska’s power, didn’t qualify. Hydropower, which is an important energy source in many communities, also didn’t qualify, or received a lesser credit. 
Legislation passed in 2022 finally reformed these credits to work for Alaska. Today, the ‘elective pay’ provision allows not-for-profit entities like our electric cooperatives and governments to take the credit in cash, putting them on equal footing with the rest of the country. The new credit is technology-neutral, so hydro and geothermal can qualify. And the entire state of Alaska receives a 10% bonus on top of the 30% baseline.
As the U.S. Senate works on President Trump’s comprehensive budget reconciliation package – his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – we urge Sen. Dan Sullivan and Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, as well as Rep. Nick Begich, to safeguard the federal investment tax credit and the production tax credit provisions. The House budget bill stripped the most important parts for Alaska before we can even benefit, and would drive up electric rates. Early Senate edits may soften some of these changes, but most Alaska projects won’t be able to access the incentives before they phase out. 
Depending on the final text, the Railbelt stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, from the state’s proposed Dixon Diversion hydro expansion, planned wind farms, and solar on the Kenai Peninsula. That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit. This comes as fuel costs are driving up our already high rates, which have risen 10% in the past 18 months. Rural Alaska faces even steeper increases. 
That’s if the projects happen at all. Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits. It takes years to get projects to the start line, and the state and federal grants that kickstarted them are disappearing. Ratepayers in other communities, like Kodiak, that have already made the move to renewables but must maintain and eventually replace their equipment, will also lose if these incentives are taken away. If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas. With the Senate expected to vote on final language for these provisions within the next few weeks, Alaska’s window to defend these benefits is rapidly closing. 
Draft Senate language means many projects would have to start construction almost immediately to access the full credits, and phases them out fully over several years. Alaska’s remote logistics, long supply chains and short building seasons mean that a single delayed barge could make ratepayer costs jump. Slower-to-build projects like hydro plants don’t have a hope of meeting the schedule.
“Prohibited foreign entity” rules demand that utilities prove that no wire or microchip ever touched a blacklisted country. A small rural co-op has no chance of tracking this and could see money clawed back years later for an honest mistake.
Alaska needs our congressional delegation to help keep the elective pay option, technology neutrality, the 30% baseline, and Alaska’s 10% energy community bonus. 

It is also important to fix the parts of this bill that don’t work for Alaska. We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.
Our state has waited decades to benefit from federal clean energy incentives. These credits are our chance to finally diversify our energy system and build a more stable, affordable future. Let’s not eliminate Alaska’s opportunity before we can use it.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The general manager of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District has been put on leave, with officials saying only that it involves a “personnel matter.”
Mike Sousek, who has served as the district’s general manager for the past two years, was recently suspended from the $178,000-a-year position.
On Wednesday, the Lincoln-based NRD voted to have Assistant General Manager David Potter perform both his job and the general manager’s responsibilities.
Bob Anderson, the chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, told the Examiner on Friday that Sousek’s job status was a “personnel matter,” and he wasn’t able to comment further.
“I want to be sensitive to all parties,” Anderson said.
The suspension of the general manager comes days after the NRD resolved a federal lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination by a candidate for the general manager’s job when Sousek was hired in March of 2023.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the lawsuit claiming that she was bypassed for the NRD’s top job because she was a woman. She also claimed that she was retaliated against after she filed a sex discrimination claim with the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission.
Her lawsuit stated that two members of the committee interviewing candidates for the general manager’s job told her that the agency wasn’t ready to have a female in the top job.
She left the NRD in January, with her lawsuit stating that Sousek told her to clear out her desk a day prior to her last scheduled work day.
U.S. District Court records indicate that Barry’s lawsuit was dismissed on June 13 after a joint motion was filed by the NRD and her attorney, Kathleen Neary of Lincoln. The terms of the dismissal were not revealed.
Neary, when contacted, said only that “the matter has been resolved.”
Anderson, and another board member, David Landis, said they could not comment on whether the job action against Sousek was related to the lawsuit.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails, along with working with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.
Most recently, Sousek and the NRD have been in talks with the Cass County Board about selecting a route for a hike-bike trail to connect the Mo-Pac Trail from Lincoln with the Lied Bridge that spans the Platte River. A recommended route had won approval in the fall, but the board declined recently to give that route final approval.

(Photo courtesy Sherdan Kady)When Louvannina Tsosie walked into The Door Christian Fellowship Church in Gallup, N.M., she expected the kind of church service she had growing up: worship, music, a sermon, prayer and some scripture reading.
What she didn’t expect was a stage performance aimed at Native people that included a condemnation of traditional Navajo beliefs — and those who embrace them.
“Unfortunately, it turned out to be a really disrespectful kind of play,” she said.

Among other scenes that trafficked in harmful stereotypes of Indigenous people, the play showcased a Diné Hataałii, or medicine man, being condemned to hell for practicing traditional Diné ways of life, including ceremony and traditional healing.
Hataałii protect and preserve all traditional ceremonies and customs of the Diné way of life, and they hold a special place of honor among the Diné people.
The Door showing the damnation of a Hataałii “wasn’t a misunderstanding,” Tsosie said, but rather a “direct attack on our beliefs and spirituality.”
The Door is an offshoot of the Potter’s House Christian Fellowship Church, which was founded in Prescott, and is part of Christian Fellowship Ministries located in Benton, Kentucky. Christian Fellowship Ministries has over 4,000 churches worldwide, with seven churches on the Navajo Nation.
“Our church here in Gallup was among the first few Southwestern works launched out of the Prescott congregation,” The Door’s website states. “From the earliest days, it has stood as a testimony to God’s power to transform lives and reach cities through evangelism, discipleship and church planting.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to The Door and Potter’s House, but neither church responded.
The shock from the play prompted Tsosie to start recording a video of the over-the-top theatrical production on her phone. She then posted that video on her TikTok account with the caption: “The things you see in border towns.”
Her TikTok posts feature two parts of the play, which was set in a dark room with the stage illuminated by red lights, while ominous drum music plays in the background.
The music played throughout the show featured remixes of traditional songs, layered with sound effects to create a more menacing tone.
At the center of the stage,  a Navajo man dressed in traditional clothing kneels by a fire, holding an eagle feather in his hand. Kneeling next to the Navajo medicine man is an actor dressed in a demon costume, encouraging his actions.
Suddenly, another Navajo person appears, shouting at the medicine man and demanding to know what he did to his niece.
“She’s in the hospital. What kind of ceremony did you do?” the man shouts. The interaction escalates into violence, as the angry man stabs and kills the medicine man.
In the next scene, the medicine man — the murder victim — is standing at what is supposed to be the gates of heaven, surrounded by white light, interacting with an angel. That angel swiftly bars the Hataałii from heaven and condemns him to hell.

The stage suddenly bathed in red lights, demons surround the medicine man, taunting him. “Come on, let’s do a ceremony,” and “We don’t like tradition, do we?” they say.
The medicine man is laid on the floor, and the lead demon gives orders to his minions: “Let’s do a purification. I’ll purify your soul in the fiery pits of hell. Demons, take this pedophile and make him suffer.”
Since she posted the video, Tsosie said she has received an overwhelming response. The video has garnered more than 230,000 views on TikTok, with nearly 1,600 comments.
Tsosie said some of the comments in her videos claim she is taking the play out of context, misrepresenting the situation and she needs to find her way with Christ.
“It kind of felt like a big slap in my face,” she said.
Tsosie, 24, grew up in a Christian household in Tohlakai, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. She said she is familiar with the religion, even though she is no longer religious. She attended The Door’s service because a friend invited her.
In response to the play, Tsosie helped organize a peaceful protest across the street from the church on June 8. She said they want accountability, including a public apology. They have not received a response from the church, much less an apology.
Navajo elders and youth have reached out to her. Tsosie said the elders appreciate her speaking up about the incident because they thought they’d never see it happen. Youth have shared their feelings about forced religion and the cultural shame they encounter.
“It’s been emotional and overwhelming, in the best and hardest ways,” she said. “This moment is bigger than me, and it’s about our people realizing that we don’t have to stay silent anymore.”
 ‘It was absolutely revolting’

As she sat through the service, Tsosie said she noticed how utterly unbothered the predominantly Native audience was as the actors portraying the demons mocked Diné ceremonies.
“I guess it felt normal to them,” she said. “I think the painful part of the play was that most of the actors were themselves Navajo.”
Diné historian Dr. Jennifer Nez Denetdale said she has heard stories about The Door Church and how many Navajo people involved with the church actively participated in demeaning and derogatory remarks about their people.
Her niece witnessed this firsthand and never returned, appalled by their actions. Denetdale said demonizing the Diné people’s way of life is a long-term strategy of The Door Church.
Denetdale said the Navajo Nation has never really acknowledged or accounted for the extent to which the Navajo people have been Christianized since colonization began on their homeland.
“What follows the soldiers are the missionaries,” she said. “What follows the establishment of the forts is the missionaries and the priests.”
Denetdale holds a doctoral degree in history and serves as the professor and chair of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Her research work focuses on settler colonialism, decolonization and Diné studies.
Denetdale is from Tohatchi, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. During her regular drives to Gallup, which is 25 miles away and the closest community with resources for many Navajo people in the area, she made it a habit to count the churches along the way.
“In that stretch, there are at least 16 Christian churches, and we’re talking about a remote area,” she said. “There’s an investment in continuing to Christianize Navajo people, and in that process, they must discount, vilify and demonize who we are and our foundation as Diné people.”
Due to how heavily Christianized the Navajo people are, Denetdale said their response to conflicts involving the church, such as what was depicted in Tsosie’s video, is often not to say anything — or to deflect by saying things like, “That’s not my church and that’s not us.”
“They don’t see it as problematic because they personalize it,” she added. “I think that’s part of the problem, and a question for all of us is to acknowledge just how Christianized we’ve become.”
Denetdale said she is not a Christian, and it is difficult for any Navajo person to say they are not a Christian because so many prominent leaders on the Navajo Nation are Christian. However, she said she is a historian and knows the history of Christianity, and “it is an ugly, ugly story.”
Denetdale said she doesn’t use the terms “culture” or “religion” to explain the Diné people’s way of life because they do not adequately describe who they are. She said that the Diné people’s knowledge and understanding of the world are rooted in a deep philosophy of Diné values.
When she saw the video, she said “it was absolutely revolting” and she shouldn’t be surprised that, in this day and age, one can showcase something that has “such incredibly grotesque depictions of Diné ways of being, and that medicine people, traditional practitioners, are demonized.”
“I’m shocked, but I shouldn’t be shocked — this is Gallup, New Mexico,” she said, a city with a long history of racism and discrimination against Indigenous people.
The City of Gallup was founded in 1881. It has been referred to as the “Indian Capitol of the World” due to its proximity to several tribal nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo Nation, whose tribal lands surround the city, as well as the significant contribution of Indigenous people to the local economy.
Indigenous people make up more than 52% of the city’s population, but like many border towns, Gallup has a history of racism and violence against Native people.
In response to public outcry, the City of Gallup released a statement indicating that, since its founding, it has been a place of diverse heritages, beliefs, and practices.
Due to the diversity of Gallup, the city stated that “conflict is inevitable,” and when it occurs, their priority is to ensure the public’s safety and that all rights are respected and protected.
The city stated it cannot intervene or take sides in matters of speech and expression. However, they can and will impose reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner in the public arena.
“Freedom of expression comes at a price,” the city wrote in its statement. “It requires an acceptance of and willingness to bear insult and offense, to hear and see what one may find hurtful or despicable.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to the City of Gallup for comment, but it did not respond.
 Navajo Nation Council issues letter to church

Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said that since the video was released, council delegates have been asked by constituents to address it. Curley called the church’s play very disrespectful.
“It was very gruesome and visual,” she said, especially with the sound effects. “They went above and beyond to do that.”
On the best way to move forward, Curley said that she consulted with faith-based leaders from various denominations and traditional practitioners to hear their perspectives on the incident.
“Many of them reiterated that this type of disrespect or depiction of discrimination should not be tolerated toward any faith,” she said in an interview with the Arizona Mirror.
Many expressed their disapproval of the church’s performance, she said, noting that it crosses the boundaries of respect among faiths.
“Navajo traditional practices are considered sacred by many of our people,” Curley said in a statement. “They are integral to Navajo identity, history, and our way of life.”
On behalf of the Navajo Nation Council, Curley issued a formal letter to The Door on June 11,  expressing disappointment and calling on the church’s leadership to take responsibility for the performance.
“As neighbors to the Navajo Nation, the City of Gallup and surrounding communities share not only a geographical proximity but also a cultural and social relationship with our people,” the letter stated. “It is within this shared space that mutual respect, understanding and coexistence must be nurtured.”
The Navajo Nation Council described the performance as a misrepresentation and mockery of sacred aspects of Navajo spirituality, stating that the portrayal is disrespectful and culturally insensitive.
“Navajo medicine men are spiritual leaders and should never be made a mockery in such a violent manner,” Curley said in a statement.
The letter calls on the church to take the concerns of the community seriously, Curley said, and she is more than willing to sit down with the church’s leaders to have a “respectful dialogue on what has happened.”
“Many of our people are still frustrated,” she said, adding that they have not received any type of response back from the church.
Curley said that it is essential to acknowledge the religious freedoms practiced on the Navajo Nation. However, she said that “freedom should never come at the expense of another person’s sacred beliefs or traditions.”
“My statement is not intended to play down or disrespect another religion, but there has to be some type of respect, even as neighbors,” Curley added. “This goes across all faiths. We have to stay respectful to one another.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has not released a statement about the incident. The Arizona Mirror reached out to Nygren’s office, but it did not respond.
