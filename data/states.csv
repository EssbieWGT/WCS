(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Skeptical Arkansas lawmakers seemed unwilling to accept Thursday that the escape of a convicted murderer and rapist was the fault of only two prison employees. 
Members of the Charitable, Penal, and Correctional Institutions subcommittee grilled corrections officials and Arkansas State Police leaders for more than three hours about the May 25 escape of Grant Hardin, who was serving nearly 80 years at the North Central Unit at Calico Rock.
Hardin, 56, had no disciplinary record and was working in the prison kitchen at the time of his escape on a Sunday during inmate visitation hours. The kitchen employee responsible for supervising prisoners allowed Hardin to go onto the facility’s rear loading dock unsupervised, in violation of prison policy, Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness told the panel.

Calico Rock Warden Thomas Hurst told legislators that Hardin, disguised in a makeshift guard uniform, was on the dock for more than an hour before the inmate walked to the prison’s sally port, where a guard in a tower let him through without verifying his identity or challenging him — also a policy violation. A sally port is a secure entry-exit with two gates that are not supposed to open at the same time.
“If any one of them had said ‘no,’ Mr. Hardin wouldn’t have got out,” Magness told the Arkansas Legislative Council subcommittee.
Prison employees had recently been updated on those policies and specifically told not to let inmates onto the loading dock without supervision. The kitchen supervisor was busy at the time, but should have called his supervisor and asked to have someone sent to watch over Hardin, Hurst and Magness said.
Both employees have been dismissed, but had not been interviewed beyond being asked how they let Hardin escape, Hurst said.
Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, found it incredulous that no one has interviewed the two individuals or tried to determine whether other inmates had been allowed to remain unsupervised on the dock or others allowed to go through the gate without being challenged.
Other lawmakers questioned Magness, Hurst and Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne about whether the policy violations were endemic.
Hurst replied that the employees simply became complacent and that prison officials are working on keeping staff vigilant. He also said prison policy has changed to ensure no inmates are allowed onto the loading dock.

Magness said prison officials are also looking at installing some sort of electronic system that would alert a higher ranking officer whenever the gates are opened.
Subcommittee chairman Sen. Matt Mckee, R-Pearcy, said the problems go beyond complacency and likely extend to how the Corrections Department classifies prisoners for placement.
McKee and other lawmakers focused on whether Hardin should have been serving his sentence in a more secure prison. Calico Rock is a medium-security prison but does house some more serious felons.
“You misclassified him on the murder, and his reclassification after the rape wasn’t communicated to the prison. He shouldn’t have been in that facility. I think we’ve got major issues I think need to be dealt with,” McKee told Magness.
Before his 2017 murder conviction, Hardin had been a police officer in the 1990s, an elected constable in Benton County and police chief of Gateway, a small town on the Missouri stateline, in 2016. He was working as a guard in a women’s prison in Northwest Arkansas in 2017 when he was arrested for shooting and killing a man in Gateway. He was sentenced to 30 years for the killing.
After he pleaded guilty to that murder, Hardin’s DNA was linked to a 20-year-old cold case from Benton County: the rape of a teacher at a Rogers elementary school in November 1997. Hardin pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in 2019, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported at the time, and was sentenced to another 50 years in prison.
Hardin’s escape drew national attention, partly because he was the subject of a television documentary, “Devil in the Ozarks.” 
Law enforcement officers captured Hardin on June 6 in a forested area less than two miles from the prison. He is now being held in the Varner Supermax Unit near Gould.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250710_Thomas-Hurst-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 23:01:40.018566

(Photo by  Kentaro Yasui/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)A federal judge has upheld the National Marine Fisheries Service’s new system to manage commercial harvests in federal waters of Cook Inlet, concluding that the agency has no obligation to extend that management to state waters.
The July 1 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason lets stand a split federal-state management regime for commercial salmon harvests in Cook Inlet, the marine waters by Alaska’s most heavily populated region.
The ruling is a win for the NMFS, an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and a loss for fishers who sought federal management of all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvests because they were dissatisfied with state management.
NMFS had previously deferred all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvest management to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
The new split management system, with the state in charge of harvests in nearshore waters and NMFS in charge of harvests in waters beyond 3 nautical miles offshore, is the result of a series of lawsuits filed since 2009 by United Cook Inlet Drift Association. The association represents about 500 fishers who harvest salmon with drift gillnets, a type of net gear that is pulled by vessels.
In 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in UCIDA’s favor, triggering the NMFS management takeover in Cook Inlet’s federal waters. Gleason’s ruling came in the most recent lawsuit in the matter, which UCIDA filed last year. That lawsuit accused NMFS of shirking its management duties by not extending its control to all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvesting and instead, continuing to defer too much to the state.
UCIDA has argued for years that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mismanaged Cook Inlet salmon harvests, resulting in what the organization has described in legal documents as “significant under-harvest.” Starting in about 2000, UCIDA said in a brief filed on Nov. 6, state management “took a turn for the worse, and salmon harvest in Cook Inlet began a precipitous and lasting decline that has now persisted for almost 25 years, to the detriment of fishing communities throughout Cook Inlet.”
But NMFS has long disputed the claim that state mismanagement has resulted in under-harvest of salmon. “There has never been credible scientific support for the idea that the drift gill net fleet could meaningfully increase its harvest without harming the more vulnerable stocks in Cook Inlet,” said a Dec. 20 brief filed by the agency.
The state intervened in the case on behalf of NMFS, and Alaska Attorney General Treg Tayor welcomed Gleason’s ruling. It was “a victory for Alaska and our salmon fishery,” Taylor said in a statement. “It upheld the state’s rights and responsibilities to managing our waters.”
NMFS last month set this year’s harvest limits for Cook Inlet’s federal waters. Under those limits, there is an allowable catch of 800,126 sockeye salmon and about 147,000 salmon of other species.
The total Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvest in 2024 was about 2.3 million fish, the vast majority of which was sockeye, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

It took two years to convert the vessel and will return to service on the Seattle-Bainbridge route next week.(Photo by Tom Banse)Washington’s first plug-in ferry will begin shuttling cars and passengers across Puget Sound by the end of next week. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson made the announcement Thursday during a celebratory demonstration lap around Elliot Bay on the ferry Wenatchee, concluding a challenging conversion to hybrid-electric propulsion over the past 22 months.
Ferguson walked on board with his predecessor, Jay Inslee, who appeared in a particularly good mood. Inslee championed the electrification and decarbonization plans of the state ferry system during his three terms as governor. The debut of the overhauled Wenatchee is the first tangible result that taxpayers and commuters can ride.
“Washington state is a great visionary state. It deserves a great visionary boat and it has got one today,” Inslee exulted.
Ferguson joked that he wondered whether it would be possible to rename the Wenatchee as the Inslee. Washington’s former chief executive responded that it would be better to rename it the Trudi, for the former first lady who was standing nearby and has been his most trusted adviser.
Amid the friendly banter, no one mentioned that superstitious mariners consider it bad luck to rename a vessel.
When the Wenatchee returns to service, it will ply the Seattle-Bainbridge route, which has the highest ridership at Washington State Ferries. It will run part-time in the evenings to ease in, returning to full-time service by the end of the month. Ferguson said the 202-car ferry now takes the crown as the largest hybrid-electric ferry in North America.
A little less vibration and a little quieter
As the Wenatchee set sail from downtown Seattle on a short figure-eight loop around the bay, passengers noted a little less of the usual rumble while getting underway. Later, the captain steered the vessel on battery power alone for a spell.
“When we’re going along at service speed and we’re on pure electric, it’s noticeably quieter in the cabin,” Captain Robert Merideth said in an interview. “On the car deck not so much because of the noise of the boat going through the water.” 
“It’s wonderful to drive,” Merideth added from the wheelhouse. “We have to look to the future.”

The main reason the state spent $133 million on the hybrid-electric conversion and other mid-life refurbishment was to save fuel and reduce air pollution. On that score, the climate friendliness will initially be constrained by the lack of any place to plug in the Wenatchee to recharge its massive battery packs.
The complicated shore power infrastructure is in the design phase for the downtown Seattle, Bainbridge, Bremerton, Kingston and Clinton terminals. The Seattle terminal’s plug-in charging arm and power supply will probably be completed first, but not before 2029, according to a presentation to the state House Transportation Committee on Tuesday.
During the Wenatchee’s conversion to battery-powered propulsion, shipyard workers removed two locomotive-sized diesel engines. They kept two diesel-driven electric generators to supply backup power for when the batteries run low. The ultimate goal is to operate purely electric most of the time. But for the next few years, those diesel generators are the full-time source of power for all of the boat’s systems.
“We anticipate saving 25% on the fuel just running in hybrid mode on this boat until we can start charging” from shore, Washington State Ferries chief Steve Nevey told reporters on board Tuesday.
Nevey said the revampe9od ferry’s powertrain works somewhat akin to a plug-in hybrid Prius. In the engine room, staff chief engineer Terry Chen called up an on-screen display that showed the direction of the electron flow between the batteries and the motors that Prius drivers might recognize from their own car dashboard displays. The updated ferry will get an efficiency boost by recapturing energy, not from regenerative braking as in a car but from the boat motor shedding load when the captain pulls back the throttle.
WSF said the battery banks in the engine room below the car deck are equipped with water mist fire suppression systems and advanced safety monitoring features. The batteries themselves are said to be fire resistant and have “emergency stop circuits,” according to a handout.
Will there be more ferry conversions?
The overhaul of the vintage 1998 Wenatchee took nearly twice as long as planned and ran far over the original budget. WSF Electrification Program Administrator David Sowers told state lawmakers on Tuesday that it has been “a very long and difficult project for us.”
“There were things about the vessel that weren’t fully captured in the design drawings,” Sowers explained. “It’s like an old house. As you open up the walls, you find things that you didn’t expect, and you have to make changes to the contract.”
WSF owns two other ferries of the same Jumbo Mark II class, the Tacoma and the Puyallup. Sowers said he anticipates it would cost significantly less to convert the Wenatchee’s sister ships to hybrid electric propulsion given all the lessons learned over the past two years.

Whether the Wenatchee is a one-off or the first in a series of diesel to hybrid-electric conversions as envisioned by Inslee remains an open question. 
In March, Ferguson pressed pause on planned conversions of the Tacoma and Puyallup in order to keep as many ferries in the water as possible and speed up the restoration of pre-pandemic service levels. On Thursday, Ferguson said his thinking about this has not changed; he’ll reevaluate conversion plans after the surge of visitors anticipated to descend on Western Washington for soccer’s 2026 World Cup abates.
“I’m very proud to be here standing on the first hybrid electric vessel in Washington state’s ferry fleet,” Ferguson said. “The good news is it certainly won’t be the last.”
That remark left a smile on Inslee’s face, but it was an easy pledge for Ferguson to make because the state recently ordered three brand new 160-car hybrid electric ferries from a Florida shipyard. The first of the ferries is expected to be delivered around 2030.

(Photo: John Partipilo)In May Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell wrapped up his 2025 State of Metro address with a call for Nashvillians to “give ourselves some more choices about how we move into our future together.” 
Let’s grant off the top that political State of The Whatever speeches inevitably amount to ritually upbeat exercises in civic fantasy with a news making shelf life of about an hour. But parking the cynicism for a few minutes (a heavy lift for me) I found myself chewing on hizzoner’s yen for a promising future as I scanned recent news items on the city’s economic trajectory:

A story chronicling how Nashville over the last decade has parlayed its Music City branding into an unstoppable tourism growth juggernaut that “catapulted us to where we are today,” according to the head of the city’s Chamber of Commerce. 
News that aggressive development of tall gleaming apartment buildings has gifted (some might say saddled) the city center with a large inventory (some might say glut) of unrented tall-gleaming-apartment-building apartments, with vacancies said to number in the thousands. 
Word that the design of a new boulevard down the heart of the Cumberland River’s East Bank may turn out to be just another six-lane car-centric pike rather than the multimodal transit dreamscape we were invited to imagine when the East Bank vision thing went down three years ago. 
Numbers showing that Nashville’s downtown office vacancy rate well exceeds the national average, with many of the city’s largest non-government buildings losing significant value.
Reporting that the downtown convention center is pondering a massive expansion because, according to Music City Center CEO Charles Starks, “we simply don’t have the space to accommodate every group, and we’re turning away business daily.”

Taken together the picture these and similar dispatches paint is a paradoxical one: a city that manages to be simultaneously vibrant and stagnant. There’s a lot going on, yet it somehow feels like Nashville is  running in place. 
To be sure, indicators of economic vim abound: rising population with job growth to match, relentless tourism, low unemployment, new hotels, pricey apartments, added BNA destinations, and let’s not forget expanding options for hot chicken and (finally!) good Italian. It all makes for an impressive array of signals of a certain kind of urban vitality, but these are markers of growth itself, not necessarily development or advancement (except maybe the good Italian part).

Growth doesn’t automatically make a city a better place, and it certainly doesn’t by itself spark us to “move into the future together.” I’ll admit that’s a pretty pedestrian observation, but apparently not pedestrian enough to penetrate the collective crania of the forces driving economic Nashville. If music is Nashville’s cultural house of worship, growth for the sake of growth is its civic religion, propelled by its lead divine commandment: more is better.
This may have made some sense ten or fifteen years ago, as outside attention to Nashville’s blossoming cosmopolitanism grew and the city began to imagine itself flourishing into something that might rate the adjective world-class. But taken to extremes, more-is-better means a shortage of forward-looking adults in the room ready to tap the brakes when the thing spins out. 
That spin has produced for us the opposite of world class: a city center that is principally a lucrative theme park of intoxication in which corporate operators profit off synthetic music celebrity branding, culinary mediocrity, and exploitation of talented musicians hustling for a subsistence living as country-rock human jukeboxes. 
It is also a downtown that many Nashvillians want little to do with. The same apparently can be said about business. The concerning downtown office vacancy rate I mentioned above isn’t just an artifact of post-Covid hybrid work; it’s in part due to some enterprises choosing to escape the theme park and relocate outside the heart of downtown. 
We have, quite simply, lost control of our downtown, with no relief in sight: the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp’s strategic plan gleefully projects significant growth in visitor spend and hotel occupancy through the mid-2030s. Those who profit off of it will inevitably insist that given how taxation works around here, a theme-park downtown is the price we must pay to fund everything else. 
My rejoinder: a city without an active core that can commercially and culturally engage both locals and visitors is an uninteresting city, and a theme park for inebriated visitors doesn’t qualify. The idea that untamed growth makes all the other good stuff possible would be more compelling if we had more to show for what we have let tourism become over the last 15 years beyond incremental improvements in generally mediocre regimes of education, transportation, and attainable housing.
I don’t want to suggest there has been an absence of forward-looking thinking in and about the city. Last year’s Imagine Nashville project, self-described as a “community-led process to unify the city around a set of priorities and actions to guide Nashville over the next decade,” is an ambitious example. Its final report—subtitled “A Vision for Nashville’s Future”— offered a large array of goals, metrics, and action ideas in four buckets: standards of living, transit, housing, and neighborhood quality of life. It’s a strong document, but their ambit apparently didn’t include much attention to the city’s commercial and geographic center. 
 
It has become fashionable to put untethered growth on notice. “Growth brings mostly benefits and advantages if it is more carefully managed,” reads the Imagine Nashville report. The challenge is to grow “in a smart way … showing duty of care of the city and that we want to protect it,” says Convention and Visitors Corp CEO Deana Ivey.
Charming thoughts but it’s all lip service, and it’s getting old. Many look around downtown Nashville and think: Well, better this than the hollow shell of commercial decay it was thirty years ago. That’s not an insane position. But you can also look around and ask: Who did this to us and how do we make it stop? And by the way does anyone seriously think that doubling the size of the Music City Center and building more hotels so we can stuff more conventioneers and bachelorettes into more cookie-cutter celebrity bars is the answer?

A new local journalism report from Rebuild Local News and Muck Rack reveals a 75% decline in local journalists across the country since 2002. 
“The goals of this new report and project is to try to create a measure of journalists per population and an index that could be recreated each year down to the county level,” Rebuild Local Journalism Founder Steve Waldman said during a webinar Thursday. “The reason that we all felt that that was important is that at the heart of the local news crisis is the lack of coverage and the lack of reporters in communities.”
The report, which was released Thursday, found that the shortage of local journalists is both severe and widespread. This shortage is measured by a new metric called Local Journalist Equivalents (LJEs), which uses a formula to evaluate the strength of local journalism. LJEs were determined by outlet types, verifiable bylines and reporting capacity based on factors like publishing frequency. This data was then used to show nationwide trends and state specific metrics.
In 2002, there was a national average of about 40 local journalists per 100,000 people. Today, that figure has dropped to an average of 8.2 Local Journalist Equivalents. Georgia’s average currently sits well below that number, landing Georgia at No. 46 on this year’s ranking.
With a statewide population of 11 million people, Georgia has an average of 5.8 Local Journalist Equivalents per 100,000 people. This average was significantly less than the No. 1 ranked state of Vermont that has an average of 27.5. Nevada trailed four places behind Georgia with the lowest ranked average of 4.8 local journalists.
While the decline of local news is not a new phenomenon, the report confirms that rural areas are not the only communities underserved by local news. Many fast growing areas including Los Angeles and Las Vegas also scored below the national average.
Richard T. Griffiths, a retired reporter and president emeritus of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said continued decline of local journalism goes beyond local journalists.
“It’s not the industry that is the future casualty of this, it’s democracy itself,” Griffiths said. “If you have a populace that doesn’t understand what’s going on in its community because there are no reporters able to go to the meetings to figure out what’s going on, then you have a collapse of the institutions that underpin our society and our democracy.”
Griffiths cited waning advertising dollars and the rise of social media as notable factors behind the demise of local news. In a world of subscriptions and paywalls, Griffiths said he believes that the business model of local journalism needs to be re-evaluated. He points to nonprofit models like The Current on the Georgia coast and The Macon Melody as potential ways to revitalize local news.
While the new report may not identify clear-cut solutions, the creators behind the report hope their findings can help improve the viability and sustainability of local journalism.
“We think we made a real significant contribution here, and that this really gives a very meaningful picture of the sort of journalistic horsepower in counties across America and will help all of us to better understand both the crisis and how to solve it,” Waldman said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office charged two people this week in the first child torture case since lawmakers passed a bill inspired in part by social media influencer and convicted child abuser Ruby Franke. 
Tyrel Scott Belone and Amber Lee Leary were both charged on Tuesday with attempted aggravated murder, aggravated child abuse and child torture, all first-degree felonies. 
It’s the second time child torture charges have been filed in Utah, the state judiciary confirmed on Thursday, and the first case since the new law took effect on May 7. In late May, prosecutors in 7th District Court in Castle Dale filed an amended complaint charging Timothy James Soots and Jesica Lynn Stoops with the new crime. However, the initial charges were filed in December 2024, in a crime that allegedly occurred in May 2023. 
Lawmakers want to stiffen penalties for child abuse cases so severe they can be called ‘torture’

This week’s charges stem from SB24, a bill sponsored by Sen. Don Ipson, R-St. George, that passed with broad support earlier this year, receiving one “no” vote in the Senate and two in the House. The bill was partly inspired by a notorious case of child abuse in Ipson’s district involving Franke and her associate, Jodi Hildebrandt. 
Franke was a popular family vlogger whose YouTube channel, 8 Passengers, had nearly 2.5 million followers. Allegations of child abuse dogged Franke and in September 2023, she was arrested after her 12-year-old malnourished child ran to a neighbor’s door asking for help.
The child, who escaped from Hildebrandt’s home, had “open wounds and duct tape around” their extremities, according to a police report. Police then found Franke’s 10-year-old child in Hildebrandt’s home, also malnourished. 
Both Franke and Hildebrandt were sentenced to four one-to-15 year prison terms for child abuse.
Previously, if a child died from abuse in Utah, prosecutors could pursue stiff charges, including homicide. When they survive, “there is nothing that adequately addresses what happens to these children,” said Eric Clarke, the Washington County attorney whose office prosecuted Franke and Hildebrandt, speaking to lawmakers last year. 
SB24 created a new criminal penalty called child torture, defined as “a serious injury that is inflicted in an exceptionally cruel or exceptionally depraved manner that causes the child to experience extreme physical or psychological pain or anguish.” It can also include conduct that takes place “over a prolonged period of time.” The law requires a 10-year minimum prison sentence, in most cases.

The law is aimed at the worst cases of child abuse — during the legislative session, one advocate described it as being a “POW in your own home.” 
And according to Salt Lake District Attorney Sim Gill, the alleged abuse from Belone and Leary meets the high bar now outlined in state code. 
According to court documents, Sandy police responded to a reported assault on June 28 involving a 3-year-old child. When officers found the child, she was unconscious and was covered in bruises. 
After speaking with both Leary and Belone, detectives confirmed multiple instances of child abuse, according to the charges. Belone told officers he threw the child on the bed, where she hit the wall with her face; he admitted to spanking and using an open hand to strike her face; he said he hit her with a closed fist and slapped her in the bathroom, causing her to fall. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I have knocked her a couple times,” Belone told officers, according to court documents. 
Prosecutors described the girl being so bruised after being alone with Belone that her eyes were swollen shut, leading Leary to keep her in the house where she wouldn’t be seen for several days.
Leary was in the bedroom during at least one of Belone’s alleged attacks, and charges state that she “has never physically gotten between him” and the child. 
Prosecutors say that as the child was injured and unresponsive, Belone wouldn’t let Leary call police, telling her, “If you call, I’ll go to jail, you don’t have any money, you don’t have any friends.” Leary then told Belone she needed to have a smoke, and stepped outside and called 911. 
“If you are a parent who is struggling with your children, please ask for help from friends or family or outside organizations that can help you. As parents, we are meant to protect and raise our children in a healthy environment where they can flourish,” said Gill in a statement. “We appreciate the thorough investigation done by Sandy Police Department that helped lead to these charges being filed. All persons accused of wrongdoing are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010324_Salt-Lake-County-District-Attorney_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

Invasive plants, new housing development and climate change are boosting tick populations in Vermont, officials say, prompting new concerns about diseases the tiny insects carry. 
Although ticks have been present for a long time in Vermont, the population has grown substantially, said Patti Casey, environmental surveillance program director for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets.
The blacklegged tick, or deer tick, is the type most frequently spotted in the state and responsible for 99% of the tick bite illnesses reported to the Vermont Department of Health.
“We are a high-incidence state for several blacklegged tick-driven tick-borne diseases,” said Natalie Kwit, public health veterinarian for the state Department of Health. “For Lyme disease, we have had over 1,000 cases in 2023.”
According to the 2018-22 Tick Pathogen Surveillance Report by the Department of Health, more than half of the blacklegged ticks analyzed carry Lyme disease, an infection that can be transmitted to humans and cause symptoms like fever, fatigue, headache, skin rash, and if left untreated can affect heart, joints, and the nervous system. In Vermont, Chittenden, Windsor and Rutland counties had the highest prevalence of blacklegged ticks infected with the disease.

Ticks can be found any time of the year when the temperature is above freezing, with their peak activity being in May and June and then again in October and November. Ticks survive by biting their host for blood, which leads to the transmission of diseases.
Other tick bite illnesses recorded in Vermont are anaplasmosis, babesiosis, hard tick relapsing fever, and Powassan virus disease, which is very rare.
Since 2015, Vermont has had the nation’s highest annual number of cases of anaplasmosis. Symptoms are similar to those of Lyme disease except for the skin rash. The most common effects are fever, muscle aches, chills, malaise and headaches, but the disease can also cause people to develop anemia, low white blood cell counts, low platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. The illness can have serious consequences if not treated, especially for old patients or people with health problems.
The American dog tick, brown dog tick, squirrel tick and woodchuck tick are other common ticks found in Vermont. The lone star tick, which carries alpha-gal syndrome, an illness that leads to the development of a red meat allergy, is not fully established in Vermont.
“We’re not seeing any of the lone star tick-driven tick-borne diseases in Vermont in humans, so we’re pretty confident that they’re not here, but it doesn’t mean that they can’t geographically expand to be in Vermont in the future,” Kwit said.
To prevent tick bites, Casey suggests wearing long pants tucked into socks and long-sleeve shirts when spending time outdoors in areas where ticks prosper to spot ticks more easily if they end up on clothes. Spraying EPA-registered repellents or treating clothes with permethrin is also recommended to keep ticks away.
Once home, it’s advisable to put the clothes in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill potential ticks and take a shower, checking the body and scalp to spot bumps. 
In case there is a tick, it should be removed quickly using tweezers, grabbing the tick as close as possible to the skin surface and pulling upward steadily, and then cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol, soap and water. The Vermont Department of Health provides detailed guidelines on how to remove ticks.
The Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets allows people to send ticks to be identified. The agency doesn’t test the ticks for diseases, but it will inform people of the species, sex and age of the tick, giving them information they can tell their doctor to assess the best course of treatment in case they later develop symptoms.
Since many people don’t realize they have been bitten by a tick, experts recommend being on the lookout for potential symptoms, especially after outdoor activities.
The agency also conducts a tick surveillance program in collaboration with the Vermont Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, collecting ticks across Vermont to test them and gather data on tick species, their habitats and the diseases they may carry. 
Casey said the program has been temporarily suspended this year due to uncertainty surrounding funding. The priority has instead shifted to mosquito surveillance to track illnesses such as Eastern equine encephalitis.
“Most of us live in Vermont, in part, because it’s so beautiful, and we like to be outdoors in it. And it’s just that things have changed a little bit, and now we need to be very vigilant about interactions with ticks to try to avoid tick bites,” Casey said. “The good news is that if we’re careful, we can really drastically lower our risk for contracting a tick-borne illness.”

(U.S. Geological Survey photo)A small creek on Alaska’s Little Kiska Island has been renamed, more than 80 years after it was named after Germany’s Nazi Party by World War II soldiers fighting in the Aleutians.
Nazi Creek was the last landmark in the United States to bear the Nazi name. Its new name is “Kaxchim Chiĝanaa,” meaning either “gizzard creek” or “creek or river belonging to gizzard island” in Unangam Tunuu, the language of the Indigenous Unangax̂ people. 
On Thursday, the Domestic Names Committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names voted 17-0 to approve the new name, without discussion.
The board’s decision allows the federal government to officially change the creek’s name in federal databases that are the official repository of geographic names. That repository is used by federal agencies and commercial companies that provide maps to the general public.
The board also approved the renaming of nearby “Nip Hill,” named by soldiers using a derogatory term for Japanese people. That hill was renamed “Kaxchim Qayaa,” or “gizzard hill,” again using the traditional name for Little Kiska Island, which is not far from Kiska Island, site of a World War II battle.
Michael Livingston, an employee of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, has been working for almost two years to have the names changed. Moses Dirks, an expert on Unangam Tunuu, recommended the new names.
“I think that’s pretty awesome. I think elders … and others are happy about it. It really should have never been there in the first place,” Livingston said of Thursday’s vote.
“Like one of my teachers … used to say, if you know something that can make our community better, our villages better, be brave and stand up and say something about it, do something about it,” Livingston said. 
The new names were previously recommended by the Alaska Historical Commission, which considered them in April. The changes were endorsed by local Native tribes and Native corporations, the Museum of the Aleutians, the manager of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, Congregation Beth Sholom of Anchorage, and the Alaska Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, among others.
Kiska Island is located 242 miles west of Adak, at the far end of the Aleutian Islands. The area has been mostly uninhabited since World War II, when invading Japanese forces took 42 people on Attu Island prisoner. More than half died in Japanese internment camps.
The United States forcibly relocated almost 900 Unangax̂ residents of the Aleutian Islands, housing them in unsuitable internment camps in Southeast Alaska and elsewhere. Many became sick and died from the conditions imposed by the government.
Aleutian Islands residents subsequently received reparations from the federal government under legislation that also paid reparations to Japanese Americans also interned during the war.
Livingston’s work isn’t yet complete. He’s also seeking to rename Quisling Cove, a small body of water named after the Norwegian Nazi collaborator Vidkun Quisling. That name change remains pending.

More than $26 million in federal funding was abruptly withheld by the Department of Education last week. Districts and organizations across Vermont fear it will force program and staffing cuts.

School districts and adult learning centers across Vermont are beginning to feel the impact of the $26 million in federal funding President Donald Trump’s administration is withholding from the state.
The U.S. Department of Education told state education officials on the evening of June 30 — less than 24 hours before the funds were set to be dispersed — that they would be conducting a review of the grant programs. No timeline was given for when that would be completed.
The funding pause was part of a broader freeze by the Trump administration of more than $6 billion nationwide for after-school and summer programs and English language instruction.

Six federal grant programs were affected, including Title IIA and Title IIIA grants, which respectively fund professional development for teachers and staff, and support services for English language learners.
In Vermont, the grants for years have helped fund nearly 100 afterschool and summer programs, serving more than 10,000 students, as well as an array of English language programs, according to the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
The abrupt pause in funding has left many school districts in limbo. The announcement, which came just days before the Fourth of July holiday, has sent school officials scrambling to realign their budgets without federal funds.
That is likely to be a tough task for some districts. In the Winooski School District, the funding pause has left a roughly $700,000 budget hole for the high-poverty district, according to the district’s director of finance and operations, Sarah Haven.

The district has primarily used those dollars to fund staff salaries and has signed contracts with its staff through the 2025-26 school year, Haven said.
Because the district is a designated high-poverty district, officials have been able to pool those federal grant dollars together and have primarily tied them to salaries, Haven said.
“The hardest thing about what’s happened here is that this decision came after we had done a lot of financial planning, and we’re caught really off guard,” said Michael Eppolito, the director of curriculum and learning with the Winooski School District.
“We don’t really know what the impact is going to be, other than somebody is going to have to pay for it, particularly because most of this money is tied up in positions that we’ve already agreed that we will pay,” he said.
Eppolito said he expects to cut programming that is not vital.
“We need to start looking anywhere we can to trim things that are not essential,” he said. He pointed to a digital program teachers use to support math and English language arts instruction in the classroom.
Haven said she expects leadership to begin developing an action plan in the coming weeks. Any changes to the district’s budget allocations will need board approval.
She anticipates the district will be able to manage the hit this upcoming school year but said harder decisions may need to be made during next year’s budgeting cycle.
“In the long run it is going to impact the students that have the fewest resources or the most vulnerable students — there’s no doubt that they’re going to be the ones that are hit,” Eppolito said. “And it will be really apparent in Winooski because anything that we cut out is going to affect those kids right away.”
Budget shocks
Other districts took similar hits to their budget. The Essex Westford School District had allocated in its fiscal year 2026 budget more than $400,000 from federal grant funding, according to Mark Holodick, the district’s new superintendent.
“It’s a significant source of funding for us,” he said. “We’ve already had a number of internal meetings. We’re beginning to plan accordingly if these dollars are not released.”
In the Hardwood Unified Union District, Superintendent Michael Leichliter said the funding pause is forcing the district to pause professional development programming.
Leichliter said the federal funding pause threatens to exacerbate an already difficult budget climate for school districts in the state.
“We’ve already been in that trim back mode,” he said. “We’re getting to the point where in order to provide basic services, it will be challenging to reduce any further.”
Holodick, likewise, said his district over the past two years has cut $10 million from its budget.
“What I don’t want to see is the mindset shift from the expectation being, ‘We are providing an outstanding education to our students,’ to ‘This is an adequate educational system where we’re getting by,'” he said. “That worries me greatly with the way we’re chipping away at our budget and resources for our students and families.”
‘Wait and see’
Local school districts are not the only organizations that are affected. The grant money also helped fund adult learning centers, institutions which offer residents a path to earn a high school diploma or GED, as well as offer English language classes and workforce development programs.
Tara Brooks, the head of VT Adult Learning, which runs adult learning services in seven counties throughout the state, said the funding pause will “drastically impact our ability to serve students.”
Her organization last year served nearly 1,500 residents, helping some earn their GED or bolster their English language skills.
Brooks estimated the pause will amount to a nearly $500,000 hit to her organization. If the funds are not released, she said she will have to cut staffing.
“There’s no way around it,” she said. “We already have wait lists for a lot of our bigger locations, so in Chittenden and in and some of our southern locations … it’s only going to increase the wait lists that we have if we have to reduce staff.”
Seam-Marie Oller, who operates The Tutorial Center in Bennington County, said the roughly $36,000 cut to her organization means she will have to cut back on night classes.
“We will continue to do the work with what we have, but I’m cutting people’s hours back, I’m cutting two classes that would be in the evening,” Oller said. “Things like that impact people directly.”
The Vermont Agency of Education has yet to hear from federal officials since their decision last week, according to Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the agency.
Ballard said the agency is “closely coordinating with the governor, the attorney general and our congressional delegation on next steps, as well as continuing to provide intensive support to school districts.”
It’s unclear what the Trump administration will ultimately decide about the funds. Similar federal funding cuts in other sectors have resulted in litigation against the federal government.
Sanders wrote to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought last week, demanding they immediately reverse what he called “their illegal and unconstitutional decision” to withhold those funds.
“Your unexpected and cruel decision has sent shockwaves, distress and heartbreak in local communities all over America who now may be forced to cancel or substantially delay summer school activities that had been planned for months,” Sanders wrote.
“Further, your illegal actions have denied teachers the funding they rely on for professional development,” he added. “Important services for English learners have been halted. Thousands of school principals, superintendents, and school board members may be forced to lay off dedicated staff. And school district budgets in every State and community have been negatively impacted. That is beyond unacceptable.”
Patrick Barham, a spokesperson for Sanders, said they have not gotten a response to their letter.
Some are holding out hope that the funds will be released. Brooks said her organization is “in a wait and see mentality.”
“We’re trying not to knee-jerk react to the news yet,” she said.
Catherine Kalkstein, the head of Central VT Adult Education, which serves Washington, Orange and Lamoille counties, said her organization is relying on reserve funds in the meantime.
“We don’t want to impact our students in any negative way and disrupt the services that we’re currently providing,” she said. “We don’t know whether these cuts are going to stick.”
“But,” Kalkstein added, “it’s not something we can continue to do long term.”
Holodick hoped that officials at the federal level would “come to their senses and release this funding — not just for kids in Essex Westford, or Vermont, but for the students across this country right now.”

(Photo by Blair Miller)A Helena man detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents looking for different Latino men had his rights violated and should be released immediately, his lawyers argued Thursday in U.S. District Court in Missoula.
Additionally, the court should prevent the U.S. government from immediately re-arresting Christopher Martinez based on the same evidence — because it was obtained illegally, said lawyer Molly Danahy of the Upper Seven law firm.
But Judge Dana Christensen said he wanted to know whether the federal district court had authority in the first place, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon said the court did not.
Rather, Weldon said the case against Martinez should be heard in immigration court, also the proper venue for raising questions about his rights.
  Upper Seven lawyers Molly Danahy, left, and Rylee Sommers-Flanagan, founder, argue Christopher Martinez should be released because he was unlawfully detained by ICE. The U.S. government argues the case should be in a different jurisdiction. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
Thursday, the lawyers made their arguments to Christensen before a full gallery in a case that has sparked alarm and outrage in Helena and beyond.
Martinez is a Mexican citizen and national who lives in Helena with his wife and children, according to court records. His wife and their children are American citizens.
After a U.S. Marshals Service officer released his handcuffs in court, Martinez reached out to his family in the gallery and touched the face of the littlest child.
Last week, law enforcement officers arrested Martinez during a hunt for two different people, Venezuelan nationals, according to court records.
Martinez’s lawyers allege he was detained illegally, based on appearing to share the same racial ethnicity as the suspects.
His attorneys said Martinez was engaged in legal activity when he was arrested. They said he was buying parts to fix a hot tub he was repairing.
But a nearby area was under surveillance, and in search of the other suspects, Helena Police Department officers who were part of the task force observed Martinez, a court document said. It said an ICE officer then requested police stop Martinez.
Six minutes later, police determined his truck had expired plates, court records said. They said a masked ICE officer and other officers interrogated Martinez about his immigration status.
The officers could easily have verified Martinez’s identity and confirmed he was not one of their suspects based on a traffic stop the previous day, attorneys said. Instead, they purposefully delayed processing the citation, and ICE officers took him to an unmarked vehicle.
In court, the U.S. Attorney’s office confirmed removal proceedings had started against Martinez.
However, in response to a question from Christensen, Weldon confirmed he understood the judge did not want Martinez deported before he had a chance to issue an order.
The judge ruled Martinez would remain in custody in the meantime.
Martinez’s lawyers are asking the court to find it has jurisdiction in the case, declare his detention violates the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal search and seizures, and to release him immediately.
Danahy argued law enforcement officers had no reason to arrest Martinez before they stumbled across his expired registration after first racially profiling him.
And she said the law does not allow officers to “transform” an issue into an immigration case without prior suspicion.
However, the judge read from court records that said Martinez illegally entered the U.S. on multiple occasions and was expelled. The records the judge read said he applied for entry in 2014 and 2018 but was denied and was under a 10-year ban as a result.
Christensen also wanted to know what would prevent the U.S. government from indicting Martinez for illegal re-entry even if he was released from custody.
Danahy, though, said the government gathered evidence about him unlawfully, and the court should stop the government from immediately rearresting Martinez.
Weldon, on behalf of the government, argued Martinez is being held on a lawful arrest warrant, and the parties were essentially “in the wrong courthouse.”
He said Martinez could raise questions about whether his arrest was legal in the immigration court instead.
“Mr. Martinez will have his day in court, but that day is not in this court,” Weldon said.
Christensen said he would issue an order as quickly as possible.
In a press conference after the hearing, Upper Seven founder Rylee Sommers-Flanagan said Martinez did not have a criminal record or warrant for arrest when he encountered ICE agents.
“They were not looking for Christopher,” Sommers-Flanagan said.
However, he has been detained for the past nine days, his lawyers said.
Sommers-Flanagan said the situation is tied to an “aggressive attack” on immigration by the Trump administration, and it presents “a somewhat unprecedented moment for courts.”
“They need to have an opportunity to consider these questions really thoroughly,” she said.
After the hearing, Martinez’s wife, Maria Pacheco, said her husband was deprived of his rights.
She and his lawyers also said he was prevented from seeing an attorney while initially detained in Lewis and Clark County.
“I just think it’s unfair,” Pacheco said. “He should have the time to be with his kids and his wife.”
The hearing drew members of the League of Women Voters of Missoula and members of the public. In a statement, local league President Mary LaPorte said the organization was concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Martinez.
“When due process is denied to some people, it puts all of our rights at risk,” LaPorte said.
Community member Nancy Seldin of Missoula said she showed up to court because she believes the justice system should be fair to all.
“I think it’s important for citizens to show up in support of people who might be subject to extrajudicial proceedings,” Seldin said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

Based in Kennett Square, Chester County, private equity-backed Genesis HealthCare said in a statement Wednesday that the petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection would permit it to pursue a reorganization plan with minimal disruption. 
It said the reorganization would allow staff to retain their positions, pay and benefits so that patients and residents would continue to be served by providers they trust. Genesis operates 42 facilities in Pennsylvania and a total of 175 across the country.
“We assure all those who rely on us for care that we remain fully focused on and committed to providing the high-quality care you have come to expect, and we thank you for your continued confidence,” Lauren Murray, the company’s chief operating officer, said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A Shapiro administration official said Thursday that Genesis HealthCare’s bankruptcy is another example of a bad outcome when private equity investors become involved in health care. 
“Governor Josh Shapiro strongly believes that private equity should get out of the nursing facility business in Pennsylvania,” Department of Human Services Press Secretary Brandon Cwalina said.
Among his budget priorities this year, Shapiro proposed a plan that would prevent investors from stripping money and resources from nursing facilities, community hospitals and other health facilities. The measure is awaiting action in the state Senate, 
In April, Crozer Health System closed its two remaining hospitals in Delaware County after its parent company Prospect Medical Holdings declared bankruptcy. Efforts to keep Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital open were unsuccessful, leaving the suburban Philadelphia county of nearly 600,000 people with only two emergency rooms.
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.
The Genesis bankruptcy filings list $708.5 million in secured debt, which the company proposes to satisfy through the sale of its assets to a “stalking horse bidder” affiliated with the primary secured creditors. The bankruptcy petition also lists nearly $800 million in unsecured debt to creditors who include the Internal Revenue Service, vendors and the recipients of legal settlements. 
Pennsylvania is Genesis’ fourth largest unsecured creditor with a $58 million claim for taxes the state collects from some providers participating in Medicaid. 
In its bankruptcy filings, Genesis asks the court to approve $30 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its primary creditors that would allow the company to continue operating, pay its employees and maintain business relationships during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings.
The company’s bankruptcy comes amid uncertainty over how the federal budget reconciliation’s $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over ten years will affect providers across the country. The effect on the state budget, which was due June 30, is also uncertain. Shapiro noted Monday that Pennsylvania would lose billions it can’t afford to backfill. 
The state Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Some 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases.
Advocating for Seniors, an association of long-term care providers across the country, said underfunding in Pennsylvania coupled with reductions in the state’s Medicaid reimbursement rates are a major cause of Genesis’ financial distress. 
DHS recently proposed reimbursement rates for nursing facilities, called the budget allocation factor, that would provide long-term care providers only 80% of their calculated reimbursement costs. Those are already based on audited costs and the care needs of patients, according to the association.
“Long-term care facilities cannot keep their doors open in this chaotic and unreliable environment,” said Brittany Crampsie, spokesperson for Advocating for Seniors
Dropping reimbursement rates, staffing ratios that facilities struggle to meet and a late state budget with no certainty about funding for nursing homes will put residents in peril, Crampsie said.

“Facilities are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. Some are closing. Many more are considering that option. We need increased funding in the budget now,” she said.
Cwalina said DHS works to ensure Medicaid recipients have access to quality nursing facility services while operating within the funding the General Assembly appropriates in the state budget. He said it’s inaccurate to say the budget allocation factor is what is pushing nursing facilities to the brink of closure. 
The process for setting the rates and the use of the budget allocation factor is set in state law and the proposed rate assumes that funding in the 2024-2025 budget will remain level. If the amount of funding changes, the rates would be revised. 
“In the case of Genesis HealthCare, this is another private equity-backed health care organization that has bled dry by greed and mismanagement. Genesis owes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania – and its taxpayers – $58 million, and like every taxpaying-resident of Pennsylvania, they should pay their fair share,” Cwalina said. 
Last month, the state House passed legislation proposed by Shapiro to give the state Attorney General’s Office oversight of mergers and acquisitions involving health care companies, prohibit sale-lease back agreements, and require health care facility buyers to submit financial and operational disclosures to the state.
Less than a decade ago, Genesis was the largest skilled nursing operator in the nation, with over 500 facilities and 60,000 beds in 30 states, according to a court filing. The growth strategy wasn’t profitable and it began to divest unprofitable facilities. 
The COVID-19 pandemic struck another blow and Genesis narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2021 with a $100 million injection of capital from private equity firm ReGen Healthcare. 
It also renegotiated its master lease with landlord Welltower, a health care focused real estate investment trust, to which the company owes more than $112.6 million, according to court documents. Welltower is the largest owner of senior housing facilities in the United States, according to Hindenberg Research, which specializes in forensic financial research.
The company’s legacy costs, which include $8 million a month in settlement and defense costs associated with personal injury and wrongful death claims, proved insurmountable, the court papers say.
Genesis said in a court filing that in the first half of the year, it has engaged in negotiations with its creditors to negotiate the terms of a “comprehensive solution” and entered bankruptcy with a “clear and defined exit path.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1483938846-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

The amount of bond is discretionary, according to Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School who represents De La Cruz and Perez.
“It’s undeniable that Heidi’s case is sympathetic,” Stokes said in a text message Thursday. “The fact that she is 18, just graduated high school, really played with the judge.”

To receive bond during an immigration court hearing, the attorney for a detained immigrant must convince the judge that the person is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. The federal government, on the other hand, seeks to prove that one or both of those risks warrants keeping them behind bars. 
The Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency that oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which held De La Cruz and Perez in detainment since their apprehension almost a month ago, didn’t convince the judge that Perez should be kept in custody, according to Stokes.
“Nacho’s was higher because [the] judge indicated that she believed that Nacho posed a greater flight risk,” Stokes said. 
When considering De La Cruz’s flight risk, the judge weighed the amount of time De La Cruz spent in the U.S. without taking substantial steps toward applying for relief for his potential removal from the country, Stokes said. 
Neither the judge nor the Department of Homeland Security argued that De La Cruz or Perez posed a danger to their community. Stokes called the granting of bonds the right outcome. 
“My heart breaks thinking of the toll that getting to this point took on both of them,” Stokes said. 
Both De La Cruz, 29, and Perez had cases pending in both federal court and immigration court.

In federal court, both filed habeas corpus petitions alleging their initial apprehension on June 14 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection was unlawful and the result of racial profiling. 
The pair were pulled over in De La Cruz’s Ford Transit van on a Saturday around noon after delivering food to local farmworkers who have been apprehensive about leaving their farm in the midst of an ongoing immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, according to court records. Both allege in filings in that case that Border Patrol agents did not give them a valid reason for the stop.
In a declaration filed in support of his habeas corpus petition, De La Cruz stated that Border Patrol Agent Arnold Parent, who initially pulled them over, told him in broken Spanish “that the fact that I spoke Spanish and did not understand English was enough for the stop.” 
In a separate affidavit filed by Parent’s colleague, Parent said he had reasonable suspicion for the stop: He noticed through the van’s windows that both De La Cruz and Perez appeared evasive to law enforcement, with darting eyes, hands clenched on the steering wheel, and the fact that they did not smile or wave when driving past the agent. Parent said he had not seen either on the rural road previously and they were not wearing the typical clothes of farmworkers.
De La Cruz and Perez allege that they were physically harmed by the interaction. De La Cruz’s face was injured when a Border Patrol agent bashed in the driver’s side window, shattering glass, De La Cruz said in his declaration. Agents also twisted Perez’s arm behind her back and injured her nail, she and De La Cruz attested. 
Border Patrol agents threatened further harm to Perez, De La Cruz alleged in his declaration, if he did not cooperate with providing information, such as his fingerprints and DNA. He said an interpreter told him “that they did not want to hurt her again but would do so if it became necessary. He also said that they had children and would not want anyone to harm their own children.” 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael Niezgoda told VTDigger on Tuesday that matters around De La Cruz’s and Perez’s cases “all relate to an ongoing criminal prosecution, court proceeding, or immigration hearing currently being litigated in the District of Vermont District Court or Immigration Court,” and therefore would not comment.
Their cases were heard in Massachusetts because Vermont does not have an immigration court that hears ICE cases.
Both De La Cruz and Perez had bail hearings scheduled this week for their federal petition in Vermont Federal District Court in Burlington. Perez’s hearing was delayed after the judge asked for more information from both sides, and De La Cruz’s was postponed. They had a temporary restraining order, which prevented their removal from Vermont by the federal government, until July 31.
Those bail hearings and that restraining order will be nullified. But while De La Cruz and Perez return home from ICE detention, their cases aren’t over. Both their habeas petition and their deportation proceedings will move forward.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)After Republicans found rowdy crowds waiting for them in town halls during the first months of the second Trump administration, Democrats have taken it upon themselves to host similar events in all 50 states. Friday will be Utah’s turn.
California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs is scheduled to join Utah Democratic Party leaders at the Salt Lake Community College Miller Campus in Sandy, a city that is part of Utah’s 4th Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Burgess Owens.

Brian King, the newly elected chair of the state’s Democratic Party, Millcreek Mayor Jeff Silvestrini, and others are also scheduled to speak with constituents on Friday at 6:15 p.m.
King said this is an initiative aiming to listen to the people where town halls haven’t happened, particularly in red states. Utah’s congressional delegation members, who are all Republican, were also invited to tune in, King said.
“Our feeling on this is simply ‘listen, if you’re an elected official, or if you’re trying to represent people, if you’re running for office, things like that, you need to make sure that you listen to the people that you’re trying to represent and that you find out what they want and don’t want and you receive their criticism,’” King said.
The last time Utah Republican Reps. Celeste Maloy and Mike Kennedy tried to hold a town hall, a crowd of about 300 showed up to protest, booing and jeering throughout the discussion.

King says he doesn’t know what to expect from those attending the Friday town hall. However, he would like to see a mix from a broad political spectrum participating.
“I want to see people who are Trump supporters. I want to hear people who are moderates, and pragmatists, and independents, and unaffiliated, as well as Democratic base voters, and more moderate, pragmatic Democrats,” King said. “I mean the range of people, I hope, is broad and reflects Utah.”
Jacobs, a San Diego congresswoman, was elected Caucus leadership representative in 2022 and now serves in the U.S. House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee. Being a representative of a Western state and sharing characteristics with Utah, King believes Jacobs will be able to understand the state needs.
“We want to have somebody who is in Congress who can come and be sort of a representative for Congress, because our representatives in Congress right now are not basically willing to receive information in a town hall setting from their constituents,” King said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)RUIDOSO — Taylor Sanchez was taking an afternoon nap on her day off Tuesday, when the dark waters surged in the Rio Ruidoso. A knock on the door from a Lincoln County Sheriff’s Deputy woke her.
“The officers came, they told me, ‘You’ve got to get out, it’s bad, it’s bad,’” she recounted near the twisted wreckage of her home in Galivan trailer park, her 3-year-old son Noah on her hip, and his five-month-old brother burbling in his car seat.
She followed their warnings, grabbed the dogs and picked up her children from daycare. She returned and watched from higher ground as the Rio Ruidoso broke its banks, filming as it swept up her neighbors’ homes and cars. Some of her neighbors needed further rescue. When the waters rose too high, she evacuated to Alamogorodo.

The deadly flooding had displaced at least 300 people as of Thursday afternoon, according to Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also on Thursday announced President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration, freeing up some funds, but a full disaster declaration has not yet occurred, and the city does not have authorization for funds to pay for shelter, food and other necessities. The declaration covers Chaves, Lincoln, Otero and Valencia counties.
Feds partially approve funds for Ruidoso flooding disaster

“We’re grateful that this approval will unlock funding needed for immediate disaster response,” the state’s congressional delegation said in a statement, “and we will continue to push President Trump to grant the state’s Major Disaster Declaration request to make sure that all New Mexicans impacted by this disaster are provided with the federal support necessary to rebuild.”
Crawford told Source NM he’s coordinating with the state for now: “We’re trying to find the money to try and find them hotels.”
On Thursday, much of officials’ focus remained on preparing for more flooding, with rains forecasted for Friday. Water service remained out for several neighborhoods, but power has been restored to much of the town. More than 600 people were without power during the floods, according to a PNM spokesman, and the utility lost 38 poles and more than 4,500 feet of lines. Only 10 people remained without power, which was expected to be restored late Thursday.

Taylor, her two sisters and their mother returned for the first time on Thursday to see what could be salvaged from the two homes shared among the sisters. Neighbors joined on front loaders or picked through the wreckage.
“I’d rather lose my house, rather than our lives,” said Rhiannon Sanchez, 25, who lived next door. She had been at a doctor’s appointment with her children on Tuesday. Now, a power pole jutted through the living room of the lilac trailer. Neighbors’ homes, marked with mud nearly to the rooftops, were sheared open, piled haphazardly on top of cars. Children’s toys, a painter’s kit, knitted blankets stripped into the black silt.
The cleanup poses its own dangers.
“The flood waters may have receded but there still may be hazards,” said Chelsea Eastman Langer, bureau chief for the Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau at the New Mexico Department of Health.
“Essentially, the flood waters usually have chemicals and debris, and if left standing in homes, will cause mold,” she said in a statement. “Private wells can also be severely damaged in floods, and well water should be tested after floods.”

Rhiannon sifted through the mud in the home, looking for her ultrasounds, and packed away the ashes of their beloved dog. Her sister Miya Otero carried out a bookcase. Otero, a bartender at the Ruidoso Downs Casino and Racetrack, said her job and life were upended all at once.
The damage from Tuesday’s floods caused officials to cancel the 2025 racing season Thursday, as Downs officials tally the damages, which compounded the damages the track suffered in the 2024 fires.
“I’m not too sure if we’ll stay in Ruidoso, unfortunately,” Otero said. “We’ve lived here our whole lives, almost.”
They won’t rebuild their home, Patricia Sanchez said, even if it means losing the community they had for 15 years.
“We worked our whole lives for what we have then from one day to the next, it’s all gone,” Patricia Sanchez said. “Now, we’re just here to pick up the pieces.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ZAM0798-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 20:08:59.426472

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).Another proposal that would legalize recreational cannabis in Pennsylvania was introduced at the state Capitol Thursday, this time by a bipartisan pair of senators.
But the measure from Senator Dan Laughlin (R-Erie)  and Democrat Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) seems unlikely to pass any time soon.
The bill comes as state budget negotiations push nearly two weeks past the June 30 deadline. Republican and Democratic negotiators have struggled to agree on how to curb the state’s budget deficit while funding their parties’ priorities.
Posting on Facebook after the new bill was introduced, Laughlin warned, “We’re at the point where tax increases are being discussed in Harrisburg to balance the budget.” Revenue from a tax on legal cannabis, he said, could provide an alternative solution.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the leader of his own party in the Senate, Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), has already thrown cold water on the proposal.
“Discussions surrounding the state budget continue to progress, and we remain committed to a final agreement, which will help to address the structural deficit facing our commonwealth,” Pittman said in a statement provided to the Capital-Star. “However, I do not see a prevailing view for legalization of recreational marijuana within our caucus as part of the current budget.”
The latest bill would legalize cannabis use for Pennsylvanians age 21 and over, and allow possession of up to 30 grams of flower, five grams of concentrate, and 1,000 milligrams of THC contained in marijuana-infused products like edibles. It would also impose a 6% sales tax and an 8% excise tax on all cannabis products.
Non-violent cannabis convictions would be automatically expunged. Eligible inmates would be released from incarceration.
Recreational cannabis is already legal in 24 states, including five of the six that border Pennsylvania — West Virginia being the exception.
Democrats in Harrisburg have broadly supported recreational marijuana legalization for some time, and Gov. Josh Shapiro has repeatedly called on lawmakers to act. But the idea has struggled to gain traction in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Earlier this year, senators shot down another cannabis bill backed by Democrats that passed the House on partisan lines.
Unlike Laughlin and Street’s measure, it would have seen cannabis sold in state stores, like liquor, which was a nonstarter for Republicans and some Democrats.
Following the bill’s rejection, Pittman called the House’s approach “unserious” and said it “took that issue five steps back.”
The state store model was staunchly opposed by the cannabis lobby, which represents many of Pennsylvania’s medical dispensaries, as well as some of the largest players in the industry nationally.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/state-capitol-state-street-1024x741.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 20:08:59.426472

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Immigrant rights advocates in Colorado want Attorney General Phil Weiser to investigate any possible violations of the state’s law against information sharing with federal immigration officials.
The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition on Thursday delivered to a representative from Weiser’s office a petition with over 2,000 signatures calling for an investigation. Leaders said the move represents a demand for public accountability.
“We are not trying to be antagonistic with this action and this petition delivery,” CIRC Organizing Director Nayda Benitez said. “We’re open to working collaboratively with the attorney general’s office to ensure that Colorado state laws are being upheld, and that all Colorado families, regardless of their immigration status, feel safe being here.”

The petition specifically asks for Weiser’s office to ensure that local law enforcement and government agencies are educated on the state’s laws against sharing personal identifying information in immigration cases except when a request for that information is part of a criminal investigation.
Last month, a Denver judge blocked Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, from ordering a state employee to hand over information requested in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment employee, Scott Moss, contended that the information requested — which immigration officials said was to ensure the welfare of unaccompanied immigrant children — ran afoul of state law because the request was not related to a specific criminal investigation and might be used for immigration enforcement.
Polis’ lawyers contended that his office wanted to cooperate with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation.
During testimony in that case, CDLE Executive Director Joe Barela said the department had complied with at least one other ICE subpoena in March.
“Let’s be very clear: Gov. Jared Polis knew about these laws when he directed state workers to share information about undocumented children with ICE, because he signed both of those bills into law. Shame on you, Governor,” said Denver City Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez, who sponsored the initial information protection bill in 2021 as a state representative.
The petition also calls for an investigation into an incident in Mesa County earlier this summer when a Utah college student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was arrested by ICE. Federal agents used information that a sheriff’s deputy shared in a Signal group chat to detain Goncalves after a traffic stop.
Weiser’s office announced on June 23 that it is investigating whether law enforcement followed state law in that interaction.
CIRC also denounced the use by law enforcement of Flock Safety security cameras around the state. The cameras photograph license plates to track vehicles. Local law enforcement mostly uses that information to find stolen vehicles.
An agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched Loveland’s Flock data on behalf of ICE six times in April, 9News reported.
Denver City Council voted not to renew its contract with the company earlier this year over concerns that the data could be fed to immigration officials. The cameras are still operational for the current contract period.
“Our immigrant communities are under threat while Flock is still being used across Colorado,” Gonzales-Gutierrez said. “Our city and our state must resist collaborating with ICE under the guise of public safety.”
Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco said the AG’s office will review the petition and its claims.

Kim Reynolds. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The sound of honking caused several heads to turn toward nearby Fleur Drive during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa at the historic Butler Mansion in Des Moines. 
A small crowd of protesters gathered outside of the Thursday event with signs decrying Iowa’s water quality, which incited the honks.
The protesters gathered there in the hopes of catching Gov. Kim Reynolds’ attention as she attended the groundbreaking for the cultural site that received several million dollars from state and county governments. 
Following the event, Reynolds spoke with reporters about immigration, water quality, the recently signed federal budget bill and how she plans to move past party tension from the eminent domain topic.
Food & Water Watch Iowa Organizer Michaelyn Mankel said the goal of the protest was to catch Reynolds in public, not to protest the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa event. 
“But we’re also here to communicate with the public that there are people and political actors responsible for the water crisis that we’re facing,” Mankel said. 
Mankel’s group regularly protests water quality issues in the state, but the subject has been top of mind for many central Iowans who have been under a lawn watering ban since mid June, due to high nitrate concentrations in source water rivers. 
Blake Iverson, a protester from Des Moines, said “it’s absurd” that the city has “one of the most advanced water treatment facilities in the world” yet the water is “not safe to drink.” 
Tap water in Des Moines, continues to be below the federal nitrate concentration limit of 10 milligrams per liter, meaning it is safe to drink according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But some argue, and some data support the idea that health impacts can occur from consuming lower nitrate concentrations. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Central Iowa Water Works reported Thursday the water coming out of treatment facilities had concentrations between 6.7 mg/l and 7.7. mg/l.
Iverson said he doesn’t spend money on an in-home water filter, or purchase water from the grocery store, because it should be the responsibility of the government and the industry to keep the water safe. 


Italian-American community celebrates groundbreaking of cultural center
Members of the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa broke ground at the Butler Mansion, located on the south side of Des Moines, which will serve as a permanent home for the group. 
The group received a $2 million grant from the state’s Destination Iowa fund and more than $1 million from Polk County to renovate the 1930s building that was, at the time, called the “the world’s most modern house.”
Once renovated, the site will serve as more than a cultural museum. It will also have an event center, cooking classroom, education center, Italian market, cafe and speakeasy. 
Jeff Lamberti, the center’s chairman, said it was a “historic day” for the group that used to meet in church basements and diners. 
“We want this to be a place for everyone,” Lamberti said. “While preserving and promoting our culture and educating folks about our rich history, we hope to create a destination for all of Iowa.”


A report, commissioned by Polk County, found nearly 80% of nitrate in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers can be traced directly to agricultural sources. 
“It’s an absurd proposition that the majority of Iowans who are not agribusiness CEOs should be expected to suffer for the profits of a tiny minority … of executives and big shareholders in this industry,” Iverson said. 
Protesters did not have a direct interaction with their intended recipient, but Reynolds said to reporters following the event that “we’re working on it everyday” when asked about water quality issues. 
Reynolds said Iowa farmers want to take care of the land to be able to pass it down to the next generation, said it’s “in their best interest to make sure that they’re doing everything that they can to protect the water and soil.” 
Reynolds said more farmers are employing conservation practices like cover crops and bioreactors to help keep nutrients on the field, rather than waterways. The state also announced a nearly $2 million project Tuesday to improve water quality in the Beaver Creek watershed. 
“They are continuing to work on processes that will help improve water quality,” she said.
The “Currents of Change” report also suggested more regulation and data on the ag industry, particularly in terms of manure application to fields. 
Reynolds, asked about this portion of the report, said “regulation is hardly ever the answer.” 
“There’s a huge cost to those (nitrate) inputs, so farmers don’t want to waste it, they don’t want to see it run off,” Reynolds said. “There’s processes right now that they can tell the exact amount that each plant needs to get the growth that they need, and so they’re doing that every single day.” 
Reynolds said she has supported conservation practices throughout her administration and said it’s an area where the state needs to “continue to put our efforts.” 
“But mark my word, they’re working every single day to implement conservation practices because they know it benefits everybody,” Reynolds said. 
Immigration policy, ‘big beautiful bill’ 
Reynolds said earlier this week she hopes Iowa can be part of the conversation with federal agencies as they try to figure out how the agricultural industry can keep undocumented workers on their farms amid the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations. 
She said Thursday the conversation is possible only because the border has been secured and agencies “continue to remove some of the you know, criminals and bad people.” 
“It just creates a different environment where you can, I think, have some of those healthy discussions to see what that looks like,” Reynolds said. 
She said issue, brought up by President Donald Trump while in Iowa, is a “moving target.”
GOP divisions over eminent domain
The governor vetoed a controversial bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines in June, which garnered criticism from some voices in her own party. Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, even said he would “work to kill” any bill with Reynolds’ name on it in the future.
When asked about the comment, Reynolds said there are “passionate feelings” on both sides of the issue that make it a “difficult issue” moving forward. 
“Time and separation does a lot of good,” Reynolds said. “Most importantly, I think all of us have the same goal, and that really is serving Iowans and making sure that we’re being impactful and we’re getting things done. Iowans are so sick of their government not getting things done.” 
She said Iowa will need to “rethink” how it identifies priorities in order to create meaningful change, especially on the issue of property taxes. 
“We want to keep the cost of moving down, and that is a hardship on some of our families, but … you’re going to have to either be a part of the solution, and there’s going to have to be some changes in how we deliver services, or if they’re not willing to do that, then we’re probably going to end up with the status quo,” Reynolds said. 
She pointed to the recent passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill, named the “big beautiful bill” and said the same thing could happen in Iowa. 
“Now, we need to work through it, we need to see what (the bill) looks like, but the fact that they actually got something done, I think, is incredible, and it really is a testament to President Trump’s leadership,” Reynolds said.

Of particular concern was the east branch of the Passumpsic River at East Haven, which, starting around 3 p.m., rose over 4.5 feet in just over 2 hours to a “minor” flood level, according to the National Water Prediction Service. By 5:30 p.m., levels began to recede.
The flooding washed out part of Route 114, according to a post by NBC5 meteorologist Ben Frechette, and threatened the low-lying Northeast Kingdom Mobile Home Park, located on the northern side of Lyndonville.

In Sutton, one water rescue team was dispatched to “assist the residents of one home cut off by floodwater,” according to the release. In Lyndonville and Stowe, more rescue teams are staging in case assistance is needed.
“The thunderstorms today are going to be capable of producing very heavy rain and frequent cloud-to-ground lightning,” Matthew Clay, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Burlington office, said earlier Thursday afternoon.

Thomson and Kit Gage. Now's not the time for backsliding by the council, they say.","Soldiers use a gas--powered leaf blower to clear an intersection at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, in this photo from 2022. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Lauralle Walker/U.S. Marine Corps)Four members of the Montgomery County Council, led by Councilmember Gabe Albornoz, want to gut the ban on the use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers that took effect on 1 July. The councilors’ 11th-hour proposal would let landscaping companies use gasoline-powered leaf blowers between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, for three years.
Councilmembers supporting this proposed exemption are consigning the health and welfare of landscape workers and county residents to the back seat while favoring firms that have failed to prepare for the ban. As writer James Fallows put it, this amounts to a cruel bargain for workers: People without power jeopardizing their health because those with power aren’t willing to shield them from avoidable risks.
The push to undermine the leaf blower ban comes almost two years after the council voted for it almost unanimously in September 2023, with an exemption for agricultural producers. Councilmember Albornoz’s latest proposal recalls his failed attempt in 2023 to exempt for five years large properties, like golf courses. In voting against the exemption, Councilmember Natali Fani-González, an immigrant, asserted, “This is about the health of low-income workers that we’re trying to protect.”
The council has eased the transition to electric-powered equipment via a rebate program. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, about 250 companies — most of them small businesses — have already received those subsidies and more have applied.

Clearly, many companies are preparing conscientiously for the ban. Further, any company managing leaves in the District of Columbia has had to use electric equipment since 2022.
Nonetheless, four locally elected officials want to cave to industry laggards, saying that, “Commercial landscapers argue that the ban will significantly harm the industry.” No documentation has been offered to support this claim.
But the hazards of gasoline-powered leaf blowers are clear. They are a health menace, especially for vulnerable landscape workers, who are often Spanish speakers and may not know about leaf blower risks. They might not have a choice in the equipment their employers provide. Landscape workers undertake hard labor — often for the very affluent — while earning an average hourly wage in Maryland of $19.76.  In 2024, 48% of landscaping workers nationally identified as Hispanic or Latino.
Gasoline-powered leaf blowers expose landscape workers to harmful noise levels, which can reach 95 to 106 decibels at the user’s ears. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a two-hour exposure to a leaf blower blasting at 90 decibels is enough to cause hearing damage.
Hearing loss is associated with a host of problems, including communication difficulties and dementia. Chronic exposure to noise pollution can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment  in children.
Routine use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers exposes community members to disruptive noise. The low-frequency component of the noise produced by gasoline-powered leaf blowers carries much farther and is perceived as much louder than the noise generated by battery-powered blowers.
A substantial body of evidence indicates that anthropogenic noise is detrimental to wildlife.
Gasoline-powered leaf blowers also expose workers to a toxic air pollution brew of fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carcinogens, oxides of nitrogen and unburned fuel. They blast whatever is on the ground — dirt, excrement, mold, chemicals, particles — into the air.
Those same air pollutants threaten public health and the environment. Operating a professional backpack leaf blower for one hour produces as much ozone-forming air pollution as driving a light-duty passenger car 1,100 miles. The Baltimore area — which includes Montgomery County’s neighbor, Howard County — still fails to meet EPA’s ozone air quality limit. Leaf blowers emit carbon dioxide, and Montgomery County has an aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goal. Reducing nitrogen oxides air pollution is important to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. An estimated one-third of the Bay’s nitrogen load comes from the air.
Montgomery County’s ban followed those of a long list of cities that have paved the way.  Annapolis and Baltimore City have also adopted bans. Further, in California, new leaf blowers are subject to a zero-emissions standard.  Such policies are undoubtedly pushing manufacturers to improve battery=powered equipment.
Safer leaf-handling methods include rakes and brooms, leaving the leaves, or mulching them with electric equipment.
We will need to keep educating businesses — especially small ones — and county residents about the need to protect workers from gasoline-powered leaf blowers. But the Albornoz proposal, which capitulates to companies that are dragging their feet, is not the answer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7407662-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 20:08:59.426472

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)For the first time in half a dozen years, the number of unhoused people in Rhode Island is on the decline. 
But the good news comes with a caveat: More people were without shelter when volunteers from the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness conducted its annual winter census for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all across the state on a frigid night in January.
Among the people who were either in a shelter or on the street counted on the night of Jan. 21, 2025, over 40% had been unhoused for more than a year, according to data released Thursday.
The results of the 2025 Point in Time count were presented to the board of directors for the Rhode Island Continuum of Care — the collection of state departments and nonprofit organizations that manage the state’s homelessness response — during its monthly meeting at the United Way of Rhode Island. 
At least 2,373 unhoused individuals were counted across the state on that Tuesday night in January when the temperature hovered around 18 degrees in Providence. The number of individuals is down 2.8% from the record high of 2,442 counted in 2024, marking the first decrease since 2019.
“Although an overall decrease seems really exciting, it’s the result of fewer emergency shelter beds being online,” Kimberly Simmons, the coalition’s executive director, told the 12 board members present.
According to Simmons’ presentation, there were 1,826 shelter beds available in January 2025 — representing a decrease of 71 spots compared to the previous year. 
As the number of beds dropped, the number of unsheltered Rhode Islanders rose over 15%. Overall, the coalition counted 618 people whose primary residence is a car, tent, abandoned building, or other outdoor space. Last year that number was 534. 
Around 66% of unsheltered people were considered “chronically homeless,” meaning they were unhoused for more than a year and have a substance or mental health disorder. Overall, 1,022 of those surveyed by the coalition were deemed chronically homeless.

The increase in chronic homelessness was the result of longer lengths of stay  in motels and other shelter space made available by the state. Advocates and lawmakers had pushed Gov. Dan McKee to call for a state of emergency over the winter to try and open up more shelter beds, with a particular focus on expediting the opening of ECHO Village — the community of 45 pallet shelters off Route 146 in Providence.
ECHO Village opened on Feb. 11, after sitting empty for a year as officials struggled to figure out how the cabins fit into the state’s fire and building codes, which had no category for the shelters.
But McKee resisted the calls to rush the village’s opening, contending that an emergency declaration would not yield any federal funds toward the issue and could create potential problems should regulations be relaxed.
“If it had been open in the beginning of the year, more individuals could have been served,” Simmons said in an interview after the board meeting..
And while the total number of unhoused individuals was down from the prior year, Simmons told Rhode Island Current that the census likely undercounted, as there are many people who are couch surfing or have been forced to double up with relatives or friends.
There were some positives from this year’s census. The number of families who are unhoused decreased by 1.1% — with no unsheltered families counted. Transitional housing increased by three beds and the state saw an additional 37 permanent supportive housing units go up.
Simmons said she is concerned that the state’s homeless population could skyrocket in the future as the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans cut funding for social programs.
“We’re still in the hole,” she said.

(Courtesy Indianapolis Bar Association)Lawyers, law students and other fans of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson erupted in cheers and a standing ovation — eagerly snapping far-off, hazy cell phone photographs during the single occasion it was allowed — as she appeared Thursday at an Indianapolis Bar Association luncheon nestled within the Indiana Convention Center.
Guided by moderator and U.S. District Court Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson of Indiana, she covered the personal — giggly tales of meeting her husband of 28 years — and got serious.
“What keeps you up at night?” Magnus-Stinson asked, during a “lightning round” of questioning.
“I would say the state of our democracy,” Brown Jackson confessed.
Role models, turning points and more
Brown Jackson, the first Black female justice in the court’s 236-year-history, always hoped to pursue law.
“My father, who was a public school teacher when I was born, went back to law school when I was three years old, and some of my earliest memories are of sitting at the kitchen table, and he has his law books, and I have my coloring books, and we’re working together,” she told the crowd. “So I had always thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I didn’t know what else you’re supposed to do.”
But it was in learning about Constance Baker Motley, the first Black female federal judge, that she thought: “I could be a judge.” And it was Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, who inspired her to aim even higher.
She spoke to promote “Lovely One,” the memoir she began writing upon her confirmation to the court, with the goal of “pay(ing) tribute to the people and the circumstances that I thought were really most responsible for that success.”
That began with her grandparents, who grew up in Georgia “in the early 1900s, in a time that was really significantly restricted for African Americans.” Neither graduated from formal schools; her grandfather chauffeured white families.
They moved to Florida, and her grandfather drove for a beer company — until he “got fed up with how he was being treated” — and launched a landscaping business. It financed education for his five children, including Brown Jackson’s mother. All were first-generation college students.

Even the timing of her 1970 birth mattered, Brown Jackson told the crowd. It was shortly after the end of Jim Crow Segregation and after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act.
“My parents had grown up in Florida under segregation, having their life opportunities restricted,” she recounted.
“I’m born … and my parents thought, this is our shot. This is our shot to do everything that we didn’t get a chance to do,” she continued. “So our daughter’s going to be in the swimming lessons if there’s swimming lessons; she’s going to do the piano lessons if there’s piano lessons.”
Brown Jackson later attended Harvard University, where, Magnus-Stinson noted, “racism was not a strange experience.” One student hung a large Confederate flag — representing the failed attempt at secession by 11 slave-holding states — from a dormitory window along the prominent Harvard Yard. A bulb illuminated it 24 hours daily.
As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against the student, but realized it was taking time from her study and work.
“The very real function of racism is distraction,” she said, citing writer Toni Morrison. “… It was a big turning point in the way that I view my purpose, which is to stay as focused as I can on the work that I’m called to do.”
“Let’s (not) be distracted from the good work that we want to do and the oath that … we took for the people we’re here to serve,” Magnus-Stinson agreed.
Brown Jackson, who is also the first public defender to join the Supreme Court, described how the experience shaped her commitment to communicating with defendants.
“They might not agree with what ultimately happened to them if I sentenced them or whatever, but they weren’t going to be confused about the process,” she said. Treating defendants with respect, she said, was “crucial for their rehabilitation.”
Throughout her remarks, Brown Jackson emphasized the value of speech and debate, clerkships and networking to the rapt audience.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is instituting new hoot-owl restrictions on rivers in the southwest Montana beginning Friday, in response to continued warm temperatures and low streamflows across the state.
The fishing restrictions prohibit angling on the designated stretches of river from 2 p.m. to midnight each day and will remain in place until conditions improve.
The new restrictions are as follows:

Silver Bow Creek — entire creek
Upper Bitterroot River — from the confluence of the East and West Forks to Veterans Bridge at Hamilton
Upper Clark Fork River — from the Clark Fork’s origin at the confluence of Warm Springs Creek and Silver Bow Creek to the mouth of the Blackfoot River
Upper Rock Creek– from the confluence of the West and Middle Forks to the mouth of Stoney Creek

Hoot-owl restrictions are already in place on other rivers across southeast and central Montana.
To check for other restrictions, click here.
In accordance with the department’s drought policy, FWP institutes angling restrictions when streamflows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm and can help reduce catch-and-release mortality by restricting fishing to only cool morning hours.
Catch-and-release anglers can reduce stress on fish by getting them to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
As the summer warms, Montana offers many other angling options with better conditions for fish, including larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation lakes and streams.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

[…]","The sign for Rosebud coal mines, owned by Westmoreland (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).The entire Montana Congressional delegation has introduced a measure in Congress — in both the House and Senate — that would overturn a Biden administration rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management halting any future coal leases on federal land from its Miles City office, which oversees part of the Powder River coal tract.
The decision to end coal leasing in the eastern portion of the state drew the ire of state and federal Republicans, but would not have ended coal production for companies which already have leases.
On Thursday, Montana’s two Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with its two Congressmen, Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, all of whom are Republican, introduced the legislation that would overturn and invalidate the decision. Such a move by Congress would shortcircuit the decision-making process that federal agencies have to follow to determine how and when to use federal land, as well as a requirements for public comment and feedback. Overturning the Biden-era decision is one of the ways the legislative branch, Congress, can check the executive branch.
“Montana’s Second Congressional District keeps the lights on in the Treasure State. Under the Biden Administration, Montana energy production took a direct hit when an outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin went into effect. I’m proud to lead this CRA in the House to reverse this disastrous management plan amendment that threatens access to affordable, reliable energy and investment in the communities I represent,” said Downing in a joint press release.
The Miles City BLM office is in Downing’s Congressional district. The Powder River Basin extends into northern Wyoming, including the coal mining activities in Gillette, Wyoming. However, the portion of public lands in Wyoming is overseen by a field office in Buffalo. In Montana, it encompasses more than 2.7 million acres of BLM land, across 17 counties in the eastern part of the state.
Closing the federal land to coal mining was one of several options that were considered by the Biden administration in 2023-’24. The federal tracts of land, though, were also subject to heavy litigation from conservation and environmental groups which challenged the permitting processes in federal court. A federal judge in Montana had previously ruled that federal officials did not adequately assess the environmental impacts of the coal when determining whether to open more land for coal mining.
It is also unclear if there is more interest in coal mining.
For example, the Absaloka Mine, which provided an economic engine for the Crow Indian Reservation in south-central Montana, lost its last customer in 2024.
Currently, several large companies have already secured coal mining tracts for years, if not decades. In Montana, Westmoreland mines coal near Colstrip to fire the large generation station there. Current leases for Westmoreland estimate that the company can continue to mine until 2060.
The Spring Creek Mine in Decker, which is owned by the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, has permits and leases that would continue through 2035, even without the change.
Mining permits in Wyoming run through 2041.
The Biden-era BLM decision was a huge blow to coal mining in America, though. Powder River Basin coal between Montana and Wyoming makes up about 85% of federal coal production and 40% of the coal production in all the United States. However, since 2008, the year of Powder River Basin’s peak production, demand for coal has been on the decline, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Still, if the legislation overturning the Biden-era rule is successful, it’s unclear how many acres would become open for mining. Originally, as the Miles City office was considering its future plans, it evaluated four different options. The other leasing options that were considered would have allowed from 1.2 million federal acres to be leased for coal mining to as few as 810.
“It’s time to put an end to the Biden-era, job-killing, environmentalist mandates, and this resolution will help achieve that. As we work to unleash Montana energy, we must support Montana’s resource economy in building a successful future, creating jobs, and powering America. Montanans voted to make America energy dominant so we can bring down prices for families and boost real wages for the hardworking Americans who keep our economy running,” Sheehy said.
In addition to conservation groups challenging the health and environmental impacts of more coal leasing, others have raised the question of coal’s viability with the shrinking number of domestic coal-fired power plants.
“Efforts to roll back BLM’s common sense plan on coal leasing are more about politics than protecting the prosperity of Montanans,”said Mark Fix, a Miles City rancher and member of Northern Plains Resource Council. “Coal simply can’t compete in the marketplace with today’s more affordable and reliable renewable energy sources. State officials should focus on positioning Montana to be a leader in robust, growing energy sectors rather than trying to prop up an industry in decline. Let’s work to create good-paying, long-term cleanup jobs for coal workers while transitioning to meet the demands and economic opportunities of today’s energy markets.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9895-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 19:10:21.970978

Chuck Grassley told reporters this week he is committed to investigating the “political weaponization” of the state’s justice systems by members of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over indictments of President Donald Trump.
On Tuesday, Justice Department officials said former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under investigation for potential wrongdoing related to Trump investigations, with the possibility for prosecution in the future, Fox News reported.
In a weekly news call Wednesday, Grassley declined to weigh in on whether Justice officials had committed crimes related to the Trump-Russia probe or other actions investigating the president.

“I can’t say that the wrongdoing I have pointed out so far, it’s more in the area of political weaponization of the FBI and the Department of Justice, and I can’t say it rose to the criminal level,” Grassley said. “But evidently the Department of Justice has reason to believe that crime has been committed, and I’ll have to defer to them. That’s their job, not mine. My focus is on transparency and accountability for the American people.”
Brennan said in a Wednesday MSNBC interview that he has not been contacted by the DOJ or CIA about the investigation, but said he believed the action was politically motivated.
“I think this is, unfortunately, a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization of the intelligence community, of the national security process,” Brennan said. “And quite frankly, I’m really shocked that, you know, individuals are willing to sacrifice their reputations, their credibility, their decency to continue to do Donald Trump’s bidding on something that clearly is just politically based.”
The Iowa Republican reiterated his commitment as the Senate Judiciary chair to following up on justice officials involved in Trump’s federal indictments that occurred during former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump was charged in 2023 by the Justice Department under the Biden administration in two cases. He faced four felony counts related to fraud and obstruction of justice for his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results that spurred the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and a 37-count indictment for keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House.
These cases were dismissed, and later dropped in November 2024 after Trump won the 2024 presidential election.
Grassley has repeatedly said he plans to investigate the misuse of power and federal authority by Justice officials against Trump, in both the indictment cases as well as actions taken on issues like the Russia probe during his first term in office. Speaking at the Iowa State Fairgrounds ahead of Trump’s appearance July 3, Grassley said of the DOJ and FBI, “everybody who had anything to do since President Trump went down that golden elevator in 2015 have been trying to get him out of the presidency, or when he was out of the presidency, into prison.”
“So we’re getting some whistleblowers their jobs back,” Grassley said at the event. “We are releasing documents.”
Grassley told reporters he wants to get “justice for the whistleblowers” who were fired or disciplined because they contacted him about their concerns about the actions taken regarding Trump, in addition to bringing more transparency to what occurred in these cases and investigations by releasing documents.
The longtime Republican senator said he is working with Justice officials in the Trump administration on these issues.
“I’ve had the cooperation of the FBI and the Department of Justice in doing this in ways that I’ve never had, even under previous Republican administrations,” Grassley said. “And because of what you might call the administrative state and the fact that they don’t want to give out information that may be embarrassing to them. So maybe the people that I’m trying to embarrass now aren’t in government anymore, but the American people need to know what was covered up and I’m trying to uncover it.”
Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee have taken some actions on these cases in recent months. In early June, Grassley released a declassified internal FBI analysis from 2019 raising allegations against Nellie Ohr, who was involved in compiling information for Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI counterintelligence investigation into alleged ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.
The declassified document alleged Ohr had provided false information in her testimony before Congress when she said she did not have knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation into Trump. Ohr worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS, the firm hired by 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee to conduct political opposition research, and is married to Bruce Ohr, a former DOJ official.
“(Nellie) Ohr never suffered consequences for advancing the phony Trump-Russia narrative and attempting to cover up her involvement in the hoax,” Grassley said in a news release on the document. “Yet time and again, the American justice system has been weaponized against President Trump and his associates with reckless abandon.”
In May, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, requested records from the National Archives and Records Administration related to the Trump election interference and alleged mishandling of classified information cases, as well as earlier investigations that led to these charges. Grassley and Johnston had previously released whistleblower reports on FBI investigations into Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.
“The documents we have released show a politically-driven conspiracy that began at the hands of a group of anti-Trump FBI officials who worked closely with Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors in an investigation known as ‘Arctic Frost,'” the senators wrote. “… We are seeking additional records from your offices on this matter pursuant to our ongoing investigation.”

While members of the Democratic-led Michigan Senate and the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives failed to broker a deal by their legal deadline of July 1, Duggan announced Thursday that his first move if elected, would be to call for a law to suspend the salaries of state elected officials if they fail to approve the state budget by the legal deadline.
“We are just six weeks from the start of the school year and none of Michigan’s 4,000 public schools has a real budget. Principals and teachers can’t properly hire or plan for their school’s opening without knowing their budget and it’s always our children who pay the price for this chaos,” said Duggan, a longtime Democrat who announced an independent bid for governor last December. 
Although Michigan law requires the Legislature to pass a state budget by or on July 1, the law carries no penalties. If lawmakers fail to reach a deal when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 the state will face a government shutdown. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, Michigan schools must pass their budgets by the end of June, meaning the legislature’s failure to meet the July 1 deadline has left districts throughout the state in the lurch. 
“For the past six months, Democrats and Republicans in Lansing have been stuck in toxic partisan gridlock. Then, they gave up on July 1 and went home without passing a budget,” Duggan said. 
Duggan noted that in his 12 years as mayor, Detroit has met its legal budget deadline in all 12, calling for a change to “politics as usual” in Lansing. 
Alongside suspending salaries for members of the House and Senate, Duggan’s proposal would apply to the governor and lieutenant governor. 
Duggan further slammed Lansing politicians for allowing partisanship to get in the way of progress, pointing to the state’s long decline in 4th grade reading scores, an issue Duggan has made central to his campaign. 
“Instead of addressing the crisis in the schools, Lansing has made it worse by failing to pass a schools budget,” Duggan said. “I promise you this: If we hold up salaries, we’ll get a school budget approved immediately. If there’s one issue that Democratic and Republican legislators agree on, it’s that they all want their paychecks.”
Michigan ranks 44th in the nation in 4th grade reading levels, with Duggan demanding additional accountability, giving principals in failing districts three years to turn things around before they would be fired, and a new leadership team would be put in place. 
Duggan pitched a $4.5 billion plan for school funding during his keynote address at the 2025 Mackinac conference, though he offered few financial details. 
While Duggan struck out from his long-held home in the Democratic Party, several other Democrats have sought to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, including Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki.

Displayed on the screen is a picture of the grass median just west of the intersection between Chenal Parkway and Markham Street in Little Rock. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin criticized municipalities for not doing more to curb what he characterized as unsafe loitering during a press conference Thursday.
Griffin called on city and county officials to do more to enforce Act 255 of 2023, an anti-loitering law that replaced a law targeting panhandlers that was struck down by a federal judge in 2020 for violating the First Amendment.
Under the act, anyone who “lingers or remains” on a sidewalk, road or parking lot in a manner that is “harassing or threatening,” is “likely to cause alarm,” or “create[s] a traffic hazard or impediment” could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in prison and $500 fine if found guilty.
“This is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of cities and counties and communities, not the attorney general’s office, but I will be a backstop,” Griffin warned. “If this is not fixed, I’m going to take action myself.”
Griffin rotated through slides displaying images of individuals standing near busy intersections around Little Rock, oftentimes with signs asking for monetary assistance. The attorney general said he lives near Cantrell Road, which often sees individuals standing on concrete medians or the side of the road asking for money.
“Some of these individuals have been seen parking their truck down the street, down the block, and then they walk down, and they do this every single day,” Griffin said. “This is where they go for their daily job, or whatever you want to call it.”
Megan Bailey, a spokesperson for the ACLU of Arkansas, which filed the lawsuit that eventually led to the state’s 2017 anti-loitering law to get struck down, said the state has “a long and shameful history” of using such laws to “criminalize poverty and silence vulnerable people.” Bailey called Griffin’s demand for increased enforcement of Act 255 “a dangerous step backward that risks violating Arkansans’ constitutional rights.”
“Courts across the country, including here in Arkansas, have repeatedly struck down broad anti-loitering and anti-panhandling laws as unconstitutional,” Bailey wrote in an emailed statement. “That’s because these laws aren’t really about safety; they’re about pushing poor people out of public view.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Griffin said the issue isn’t that these individuals are asking for money — it’s that they are creating what he described as a safety hazard because they’re putting themselves at risk of getting hit by a car and are distracting drivers.
“When you have people that close to the road with signs, people are reading the signs, or they’re slowing down, or they’re stopping in the middle of the road, even when the light’s green and they’re passing things out of their car, and they’re causing a hazard,” he said.
According to Arkansas code 27-51-104, it is illegal for drivers to drive “too close to or colliding with parked or stopped vehicles, fixtures, persons, or objects adjacent to the public thoroughfares” or “to operate a vehicle in any manner when the driver is inattentive and such inattention is not reasonable and prudent in maintaining vehicular control.”
Griffin told the Advocate that what constitutes a traffic hazard or impediment in line with the law is a “judgement call based on the particular circumstances.”
“If you’re 100 feet from a road, you’re not a traffic hazard. If you’re hanging out into the road, I would say that’s a traffic hazard. If you’re standing like this,” Griffin said, scrunching up his shoulders and gesturing to indicate cars passing by, “with cars going by on a strip about two feet, that’s probably a traffic hazard.”
Griffin said that cities cannot be top-notch “with this kind of nonsense going on.”
“You can’t be a first-class city, a first-class community, with this kind of stuff going on,” Griffin said, displaying a slide showing trash that he claimed was left behind by such individuals.
Bailey had a different perspective.
“The government cannot arrest the state’s way out of poverty, and it certainly can’t police people into invisibility,” she said. “Real public safety means access to housing, healthcare, and support — not criminal citations and jail time for simply existing in public.”
Aaron Sadler, a spokesperson for the city of Little Rock, which was featured in many of the photos shown by Griffin, said the city’s police department works “tirelessly” to enforce laws at all levels of government. He said the city had confidence in the abilities of local and state law enforcement to protect motorists and pedestrians in Little Rock.
“Every day, LRPD [Little Rock Police Department] meets and exceeds its responsibilities to uphold the law and keep residents and guests safe,” Sadler said in a text message.

,DC,2025-07-10 22:05:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,ICE official’s court testimony provides few answers on agency’s plan for Abrego Garcia,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ice-officials-court-testimony-provides-few-answers-agencys-plan-abrego-garcia,,"GREENBELT, Maryland — A top U.S. immigration official testifying in federal court Thursday did not give details of the Trump administration’s plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from pre-trial detention next week in Tennessee.Thomas Giles, the assistant director for enforcement and removal operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was noncommittal about how the agency would handle Abrego Garcia if he is released from jail in Tennessee where he awaits trial on federal charges, saying officials could not consider the question until he’s in ICE custody.“There’s been no decision made as he's not in ICE custody,” Giles said.Department of Justice attorneys have said they would seek Abrego Garcia’s removal again, because he has a final order of removal, but have not detailed the process for that deportation, raising concerns of a lack of due process in the closely watched case that were not answered by Giles’ testimony Thursday.Giles appeared after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration on Monday to produce a witness to detail the plan for Abrego Garcia’s removal.The government is likely to pursue either a revocation of the deportation protections the El Salvador national and longtime Maryland resident has had since 2019 that bar deportation to his home country, or removal to a country other than El Salvador.Abrego Garcia was wrongly removed in March to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador where he says he faced psychological and physical torture.ICE detainerGiles said that ICE placed a detainer on Abrego Garcia last month, meaning the agency requested the U.S. Marshals to notify ICE when he will be released so immigration officials can detain him. Abrego Garcia could be released July 16 after a pretrial hearing that day in Tennessee.The Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last month to face federal charges of human smuggling that stemmed from a 2019 traffic stop. Abrego Garcia has denied the charges.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys said in court Thursday that they found out Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. through media reports and they were given no information by the Trump administration.DOJ attorneys said that Abrego Garcia will be removed from the U.S. before his trial in Tennessee is complete.Restraining order consideredAttorneys for Abrego Garcia said Thursday they are concerned he will again be removed without due process or the ability to challenge his removal to another country if he fears he will experience harm or persecution. Earlier in the week, they pressed for Xinis to have Abrego Garcia brought back to Maryland, rather than remain in Tennessee. Xinis is still mulling that request from Abrego Garcia’s attorneys. This week, she also denied the Department of Justice’s move to dismiss the case as moot, because Abrego Garcia had been returned to the U.S.Xinis said Thursday she is considering issuing a temporary restraining order if Abrego Garcia is released on pre-trial detention. The order would last for 48 business hours and bar immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia to a detention center outside of Tennessee or from the U.S.She also called for a hearing on Friday at 9 a.m. ET on the temporary restraining order.Vague answersSascha Rand, an attorney representing Abrego Garcia in the immigration case in Maryland, grilled Giles on how familiar he was with Abrego Garcia’s case.Giles said that he had not directly overseen Abrego Garcia’s case and had about four hours to prepare for Thursday’s hearing.Rand asked Giles which country Abrego Garcia would be removed to if not El Salvador.Giles said that if Abrego Garcia is removed to a third country, it would take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to determine which country.  Giles said that Mexico is one country that accepts nationals from other countries – including El Salvador – and has diplomatic assurance that an individual removed won’t face harm.He added that South Sudan is also a country that the Trump administration has deemed acceptable to send deportees to.In a ruling last month, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with removing eight men from different nationalities to South Sudan, which recently experienced a civil war. The U.S. State Department advises against traveling to the country.Xinis asked Giles if Mexico, “at a minimum,” would be a country Abrego Garcia could be removed to.Giles said that was possible.Rand asked if South Sudan was a possibility.Giles said that “we have removed people to South Sudan.”Rand then asked Giles multiple times which path the Trump administration was considering for Abrego Garica, either deportation to a third country, or trying to remove the 2019 bar on removal to El Salvador.“Do you have any actual knowledge of which one of these tracks Mr. Abrego Garcia might be put on next Wednesday?” Rand asked.Giles said because Abrego Garcia is not in ICE custody, a discussion on the options for his removal is not happening. He said those determinations will be made once Abrego Garcia is in ICE detention.Giles added that it’s also unclear where Abrego Garcia will be held in ICE detention, as it’s based on available bed space, meaning Abrego Garcia could be transferred anywhere in the U.S.",,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, effectively stripping cities of the power to enact their own labor protections.
Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Missouri became the 18th state after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed a bill into law repealing paid leave requirements that voters had approved in November.
More GOP states embrace paid parental leave for teachers, public employees

Missourians had approved a ballot measure that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican state lawmakers promptly passed a bill to repeal it.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations. Laws preventing local requirements are still in effect.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
Voters deliver mixed verdicts on increasing minimum wage, but support paid sick leave

While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The state of Rhode Island will receive a total of $3 million from eight pharmaceutical companies accused of proliferating the nation’s opioid crisis as part of a nationwide settlement announced by Attorney General Peter F. Neronha Thursday. 
The eight drugmakers that manufactured opioid pills will pay a maximum of $720 million under an agreement reached with a coalition of attorneys general. That amount includes approximately $618,000 in abatement payments for all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. States may also receive additional cash instead of free pharmaceutical products for medication assisted treatment.
Neronha’s office has so far recovered $315 million in funds from national settlements with drug manufacturers and pharmacies connected to the opioid epidemic. 
“$315 million is a lot of money which can make, and has made, a huge difference,” Neronha said in a statement. “But we won’t stop until no individual, no family, suffers further from this entirely preventable disease.”
The announcement comes after Rhode Island netted around $30 million from a settlement reached with Purdue Pharma and its owners in April.
Rhode Island’s share of the latest settlement will be divided between the state and its municipalities — with 80% going to the state’s general fund and the remaining 20% distributed among the state’s 39 cities and towns, as is required under state law, the AG’s office said. 
A separate section of state law enacted in 2023 addresses “non multi-state initiatives,” creating a new restricted receipts account for money from settlements with opioid manufacturers. That is handled by the Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee, which Neronha said allocates the funds to organizations and agencies “best equipped to help” those struggling with opioid addiction.
“The good news: we are seeing real results from these efforts, from expanding the state’s in-patient and out-patient treatment capacity, to driving down overdose and overdose deaths,” Neronha said.
 



How much each drug manufacturer has settled for

Mylan (now part of Viatris) will pay $284,447,916 over nine years. (Rhode Island’s share: $1.44 million)
Hikma will pay $95,818,293 over one to four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $470,445)
Amneal will pay $71,751,010 over 10 years. (Rhode Island’s share: $393,497)
Apotex will pay $63,682,369 paid in a single year. (Rhode Island’s share $290,055)
Indivior will pay $38,022,450 over four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $176,397)
Sun Pharma will pay $30,992,087 over one to four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $141,161)
Alvogen will pay $18,680,162 over a single year. (Rhode Island’s share: $85,083)
Zydus will pay $14,859,220 over a single year. (Rhode Island’s share: $67,599)

 



Seven of the companies will be barred from promoting or marketing opioids, along with selling any product that contains more than 40 milligrams of oxycodone per pill. 
Indivior agreed to not manufacture or sell opioid products for the next 10 years, but can continue marketing and selling medications to treat opioid use disorder.
Companies must also monitor and report suspicious orders, under the settlement.
Massachusetts could receive up to $17 million, Connecticut could receive $8.4 million and New Hampshire stands to receive $4.5 million, according to news releases.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a new measles case Thursday, more than a month since the last case was reported.
The new case is in Williams County involving a person who recently traveled out of state and was unvaccinated against the disease, said Mindy Michaels, a spokesperson for the department.
The state now has 35 confirmed measles cases, with the first one confirmed April 29 in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Until this week, the state had not confirmed a case since May 28, according to the state’s measles dashboard. 
The latest case is unrelated to the previous cases and there is no evidence of community spread, said Jenny Galbraith, adult immunization manager for HHS.
The new case is the 17th reported in Williams County, the most in the state, followed by 10 cases in Grand Forks County, seven in Cass County and one case in Burke County. Two hospitalizations were reported.
All North Dakota cases have involved people who were unvaccinated.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit in Williston, said people should still isolate themselves if they are feeling ill. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a bodywide rash, according to HHS.
A single incubation period for measles can be as long as 21 days from an initial exposure.
Vaccination remains the best protection against contracting measles, Clark said.
People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
The department said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.
Clark said the Upper Missouri District Health Unit will continue to operate its walk-in vaccine clinic for measles every Thursday. She added the foot traffic for the MMR vaccine has slowed since the outbreak was first reported, but people should also be thinking about getting their back-to-school immunizations.
“We start doing our messaging to remind people after the Fourth of July because what we don’t want is everybody trying to come in the couple days before school starts,” she said.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)On Jan. 30, 2023, a person facing criminal charges in New Mexico texted the judge in their case: “I will see you at your next yard sale, I know where you live.”
In August the same year, another person texted a judge: “Either you accept it or you fight me old man…if you refuse to step down…this is war.” 
More recently, police allege 50-year-old Francisco Benjamin Cabral, of Farmington followed Eleventh Judicial District Court Judge Bradford Dalley in his car before approaching Dalley’s vehicle and screaming: “You’re dead, I am going to kill you.” He is scheduled to head to trial this summer.
An official with New Mexico’s judicial branch recently cited these and other examples of violent threats against judges and court staff as reasons to consider creating an internal security force for the courts rather than relying on local police.
So far this year, judges have faced 162 threats, some tied to high-profile cases, according to Cynthia Pacheco, director of the Court Operations Division at the state Administrative Office of the Courts, who delivered a presentation recently to members of the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee. Most did not result in charges because judges didn’t want to make a complaint, or the callers couldn’t be identified, she said.
State prosecutors thus far in 2025 have filed four criminal cases for threatening a judge or their immediate family members under the new law. Prosecutors filed five such cases last year, and three in 2023.
A law passed in 2022 that made it a felony to threaten a judge or a judge’s immediate family member has resulted in a few convictions thus far — such as the two examples cited from 2023 — but Pacheco told lawmakers it’s “too soon to know if that law is having an impact, it’s just been a couple years. We’re just beginning to charge and take those to trial.”
Staff receive the majority of threats because they’re the ones who answer the phones and work at the front, she said.
Angry people have allegedly told bailiffs and court clerks that someone would be waiting for them outside when they leave their shifts, threatened to bomb their workplaces, posted their home addresses online and threatened them with sexual violence, Pacheco told Source NM.
Between July 2024 and the end of June 2025, defendants, victims or their families have threatened court staff in New Mexico on 10 different occasions, 17 times in the previous year and 13 times the year before that, according to AOC data.
The data also shows a total of 32 threats against court buildings over those three years, along with a growing number of medical episodes in courthouses. Pacheco said most of these are drug overdoses, and that judges and court staff are trained to administer the overdose-reversing drug known as Narcan.
Court staff and judges who are subject to particularly egregious threats can receive mental health services provided by AOC’s employee assistance program, she said.
With growing incidents, Pacheco told lawmakers judicial officials believe a discussion needs to occur about whether it’s time for the state’s judicial branch to have court marshals, similar to the U.S. Marshals Service’s role in the federal court system.
She also noted the judicial branch in the most recent session had requested $25 million for security upgrades but only received $6 million. The judiciary will use the money to upgrade courts in Catron, Cibola, De Baca, Harding, Hidalgo, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe and Union counties, she said.
But she said her agency wants every courthouse in the state to have magnetometers, X-ray machines, access control, duress alarms and surveillance systems.
After those come online, she said, AOC wants to install advanced physical security like modern secure entrances called sally ports, windows treated to resist bullets, hardened clerical counters and the ability to lock down a building without having to run and physically lock every door.
But even if the courts had all that, they would still need security officers present during business hours, Pacheco said.
“Right now, that is not the standard in any courtroom, anywhere in New Mexico,” she said.
She said her agency has started talking with court systems in Oregon and Maine that have established their own state court marshals.
“Court security is a really specialized field because we want people to come to the courts, the courts should be inviting for people who are seeking justice,” Pacheco said in an interview with Source. “But we also have to make sure that everyone is safe.”
Committee Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) had questions for Pacheco about staffing an internal service and how she thought it would differ from using sheriff’s deputies.
“If we had an internal service, we would also be in a better position to train them for public interaction in a way that’s different than how law enforcement operates,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Passenger rail service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth will continue for at least another year after a Texas group agreed to chip in millions to keep the route alive, officials said Thursday.
The North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council on Thursday voted to provide $3.5 million to keep the Heartland Flyer rail service  operational, said Brian Wilson, a spokesperson.
The Amtrak service was slated to shut down on or before Oct. 1 after the Texas Legislature declined to continue funding its share of the 206-mile route.
“This funding lasts for a year,” Wilson said.
Ending the service would have been a tremendous loss for both Oklahoma and Texas, said Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City.
“Tourism is Oklahoma’s third largest industry and a major economic driver for communities across the state,” said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City. “This Amtrak route gives Oklahomans more flexibility when planning their travel and offers Texans a convenient way to see what they’ve been missing just across the border.”
Officials are considering expanding the line into Kansas to connect with other major passenger train routes. Possible closure of the service would have impacted expansion plans.
The service was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979.

(Photo via Iowa PBS) Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa and head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 12 years, said Thursday that Iowa leaders need to look toward “and” conversations rather than “or” discussions to solve some of the state’s biggest issues. 
Vilsack said during a recording of “Iowa Press” that a move to support small and midsized farms would help with water quality issues, concerns around eminent domain and the rural economy. He also spoke about recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, USDA staffing and other changes from the Trump administration.
Back in Iowa following the change in administration, Vilsack is now CEO of the World Food Prize in Des Moines, a role he said is a “continuation” of the work he did as U.S. secretary of Agriculture.

The World Food Prize will host the Iowa Hunger Summit July 16, with a focus on the root causes of food insecurity and to raise awareness on the challenges of combating hunger. 
“A challenge that is going to get a little bit more difficult because the federal government has made decisions to sort of take a step back in terms of the assistance that has traditionally been provided,” Vilsack said during the show, recorded at Iowa PBS.
Vilsack said cuts to SNAP in the “big beautiful bill” which was signed into law July 4, is going to “put the onus on the rest of us to step up our game.”

The food assistance program helps about 1 in 12 Iowans, according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The federal bill plans to tighten eligibility requirements and require states to shoulder more of the program costs. 
Vilsack said these changes will have an impact beyond the people who will be without food assistance, as 20 cents of every SNAP dollar spent at the grocery store goes back to farmers.  
“So when you cut SNAP, you’re also cutting farm income,” Vilsack said. 
The Democrat from Mount Pleasant said it will also have a “rippling” impact on other jobs in the food chain, and the state budget.
Migrant workers and immigration policy
During his recent visit to the Iowa State Fairgrounds, President Donald Trump announced planned legislation that would allow farmers to vouch for some of their undocumented workers to let them stay in the country. 
The president said the action was in response to requests of the industry, following his mass deportation efforts, which Vilsack said will have a “profound impact” on farming and food. 
Vilsack also said the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, a federal bill introduced several years ago that has not passed, would have done this by creating a legal pathway for migrant farm workers to “gain legitimacy.”
“I think it’s unlikely that you’re going to see a lot of Americans take these jobs,” Vilsack said. “These are really, really, really tough jobs.”
Vilsack predicts lowered USDA staff morale due to cuts, changes
Vilsack first took office during the Obama administration as secretary of Agriculture and then again during the Biden administration. Both times, he said a survey of USDA staff showed very low morale at the start of those administrations. 
“I think you’ll probably see some significant impacts in terms of morale,” Vilsack said. “Elections have consequences, and every administration has the right to do what they think is best for the country and for the workers. 
“But the reality is, you can reduce the workforce, but you have to do it strategically and thoughtfully.” 
Congress plans to scrap USDA Climate Hubs, following Trump guidance 

More than 15,000 USDA employees have taken a federal buy-out program offered by the government following threats of office restructuring, and in some cases, staff were terminated and then brought back on. The Trump administration has said many of these roles were probationary positions. Some of the firings across the federal workforce were challenged in a lawsuit, but the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of the Trump administration’s layoffs. 
“If you’re looking at wholesale reductions and massive reductions at one time, that makes it hard on those who are left,” Vilsack said. “They end up having to do two or three jobs, and at the end of the day, that’s pretty hard to do.” 
No more ‘get big or get out’ mentality in ag
Vilsack said there’s a “tendency” in the country to think that “every farmer is essentially like every other farmer” which he said is not true. 
Vilsack said there are large-scale farms which represent roughly 10% of all farms, get around 85% of all agricultural income and nearly 60% of farm subsidies. He said the other 90% of small, to midsized farms share what’s left of the market and subsidies. 
He said this contributes to the declining number of farms and the difficulty farmers have to make ends meet. 
“It’s a massive erosion of the basic economic unit of rural America, and I think the department, the federal government, has a responsibility to address that issue,” Vilsack said. 
Earlier this spring, Vilsack spoke with farmers near Indianola, at an event sponsored by Iowa Democrats, about his idea that the farm, rather than the farmer, should work harder.  
He shared the same idea Thursday, noting that certain forms of manure management or the climate smart commodities program could help a farm generate multiple streams of income. 
“And it shouldn’t be that the strategy in farming is you have to get big or get out,” Vilsack said to reporters. 
During his time at USDA, Vilsack championed the climate smart agriculture programs which incentivized and helped create markets for farmers who utilized sustainable farming practices. The Trump administration has canceled part of this program, the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, which it labeled as a “Biden-era climate slush fund.”
In a conversation with reporters following the taping of the show, Vilsack said the challenge will be to “keep the concept going” in the country and to have farmers experience “some success” with being paid for sustainably produced commodities. 
“This is going to continue — the challenge will be at what pace,” Vilsack said. “And we obviously need to accelerate the pace in terms of the challenges to the environment and the ag economy — I hope that we do that.”
Water quality in Iowa 
A recent report from Polk County tagged agricultural activities as the leading source of nitrate pollution in Iowa’s Des Moines and Raccoon rivers as they enter Des Moines. 
Vilsack said he believes there is “definitely” a role for the federal government to play in solving the issue. 
“We keep looking at this as an either-or circumstance, and I think the challenge, and the opportunity, is that we need to look at it as an ‘and’ proposition,” Vilsack said. “How do you essentially deal with the nitrate issue, at the same time understand the important role of agriculture?” 
Vilsack said it also fits with his idea of supporting small and midsized farmers by building extra, on-farm revenue sources via manure management strategies like an anaerobic digester. This, he said, would reduce land application of manure, which would help the nitrate levels in the river, and support farmers in their operations. 
He said solutions like that need to be supported with funding for research and economic development opportunities. 
“I think our policymakers, our politicians, have to start thinking in terms of ‘and,’” He said. “We are a country now that is thinking in terms of ‘or,’ and that stymies — it essentially freezes us — from creative thought and creative solutions.” 
Eminent domain
Vilsack said the same approach should be used for the issue of eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines. 
“How can we have a sustainable aviation industry and the hundreds of thousands of job opportunities that it can create, and the better income for farmers it can create, and at the same time, how can we respect the needs and challenges that farms have, and families have, about their land,” he told reporters.
Vilsack said policy makers need to step back and ask: “Why is it that we have this issue? Why do people feel as strongly as they do about all of this?” 
Vilsack said the reason is that Iowa hasn’t been growing, supporting the midsized farming economy or working to keep Iowans in Iowa. 
“We have to move towards agriculture,” Vilsack said. “We have to create more revenue streams for farmers, we have to create more ways for that farm to work harder and smarter and more profitably.”
Vilsack also spoke with reporters about the response from the current administration to the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 174.8 million birds since the current outbreak began in February 2022. 
He said Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins’ five-pronged, $1 billion plan to combat the bird flu was “really not a change in what we did before.” 
Vilsack said the industry really needs a usable vaccine, and said he believes “eventually it will get worked out.”
Iowa Press is hosted by O. Kay Henderson and featured Brianne Pfannenstiel of the Des Moines Register and Erin Murphy of The Gazette in Cedar Rapids. The episode with Vilsack is scheduled to air Friday at 7:30 p.m.

Members of the Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday approved applications to construct two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and another stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County.
The projects, proposed by ITC Holding Corp., doing business as Michigan Electric Transmission Company, have been controversial because residents expressed dismay over the lack of public input on the projects and the fact that their concerns regarding routes went largely unheard. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some of the properties in the approved routes run through legacy farm land, and residents are concerned about their property values dipping due to the lines and pending construction activity.
An attorney working with residents also told Michigan Advance that the company, in an attempt to acquire land prior to pending eminent domain proceedings, has been offering landowners raw deals with few property rights or just compensation.
That said, the projects would usher in the first major Michigan electric transmission line projects in more than a decade, and the commission on Thursday said the need was evident. 
Commissioners also gave the company directives on how to move forward with both projects, but with parameters for including public-proposed route modifications as it prepared for construction.
In approving the lines, all three members of the Michigan Public Service Commission expressed disappointment in the way the company behind the project handled public engagement.

“In the case before us, I believe it would be generous to call METC’s public engagement lackluster,” Commissioner Kathrine Peretick said. “We heard from impacted parties that METC refused to answer simple questions, ignored glaringly obvious routing problems, like an airport in the path of the transmission line, and took the easy, lazy path for the siting of the route in every place possible. All of this is more egregious in the context that METC is a well-resourced company that has the ability and the means to do better.”
In a statement provided to the Advance, a company spokesperson said it appreciated the commission’s approval.
“We also take seriously the Commission’s concerns regarding public engagement,” a spokesperson said. “We recognize that meaningful community involvement is essential to the success of these projects, and we are committed to refining our outreach process moving forward.”
Projects approved with some changes
In the company’s initial request, it proposed a 39-mile line between substations in Gratiot and Eaton counties, and a 55-mile line between Calhoun and Branch counties. Both transmission projects are described as double circuit 345 kilovolt lines.
Proposed and alternate routes were submitted for both projects.
On Thursday, the commission approved the alternative route for the Gratiot to Eaton project, while also approving the proposed route for the Calhoun and Branch project.
The commission found that the alternative route for the Gratiot to Eaton project was reasonable and preferable because it had fewer heavy angles and road crossings, impacted fewer wetlands and hydric soils, and used a long-standing utility right of way.
For the Calhoun to Branch lines, the proposed route was chosen for similar reasons. 
The alternative route would have avoided impacting the R & R Ranch Airport in Marshall, which was a concern cited across multiple meetings by owner Robert Williams. However, the proposed route would have resulted in more damage to archeological sites, increased the number residences within 500 feet of the line’s right of way and expanded the number of parcels crossed by the line.

Overall, both lines were found to be necessary additions to Michigan’s electric infrastructure because they would ensure increased energy reliability, capacity and opportunities for renewable energy integration. Neither project will present threats to public health and safety, and although there will be some environmental disturbances, approval of both projects was permissible under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act because there were no feasible or prudent alternatives.
Going forward, the company must consider landowners’ specific requests for minor modifications to the major transmission line routes, and the commission directed the company to file a memorandum in the case detailing how impacted landowners may submit minor route modification requests. 
The company must also file a monthly report documenting any minor modification requests, how it accommodated the request, or why it was unable to do so.
Commissioners mandated that the company must provide landowners along the approved routes, as well as adjacent landowners, with contact information so that they can communicate concerns to the company. 
The commission also required the company to file separate monthly reports detailing the communications received from landowners as well as investigate every noise complaint received by landowners to ensure there is not a system issue that needs to be addressed. 
Commissioners call METC onto the carpet over public engagement
Many of the conditions were a direct result of the company’s “lackluster” work, as noted by Peretick, in notifying residents of the plans and the few opportunities for public input that would have allowed resident concerns to be heard and reflected in project changes.
Peretick said she was bound to issue an affirmative vote on the projects because the construction applications met the requirements of statute.
But in her mind, Act 30 of 1995, which outlines guidelines for electric transmission line siting, sets the bar too low for companies and doesn’t give landowners an adequate opportunity to shape the outcome.
Notably, Peretick said Act 30 only requires official notice to landowners directly on routes proposed by a company, and leaves out adjacent properties or those in the general study area where intervenors may propose alternative routes. Although the act theoretically allows the commission to approve one of those intervenor-proposed routes, that would mean approving a route on land with owners who were never notified.
“I cannot in good conscience approve a transmission line to be built on someone’s property that was never even given a chance to argue their side of the case,” Peretick said.
The low bar of landowner public engagement was another issue with Act 30 that Peretick said needed to be addressed.
Commission Chair Dan Scripps said he didn’t want it to get lost in the shuffle that the transmission lines were a significant addition to Michigan’s energy infrastructure.
Still, the commission was well aware of the potential impacts to land owners, much like Williams and his airport.
“Even as I’m pleased to see these critical projects move forward, I would implore the company to do a much better job of public engagement in future applications,” Scripps said.
Changes coming to Act 30 guidelines
To bring greater clarity to the process and ensure that landowners were not treated in the same way again, the commission also approved an order that directed staff to develop voluntary filing guidelines for applicants under Act 30. 
The commission voted unanimously to jumpstart that process as a way to address concerns about Act 30’s lack of clarity on what constitutes an alternative route, to what degree private benefits need to be estimated in advance of a project, and whether the law provides for sufficient and clear interaction between an applicant and a landowner.
Commissioner Alessandra Carreon, whose term expires this month, said that although several people submitted individual comments on the project, they were not considered part of the official record and couldn’t be used as a basis for the commission’s decision. Carreon said that was one part of the larger issue with the process.
“However, the upcoming rule making will serve as a critical channel for the public to help shape future Act 30 applications and outcomes,” Carreon said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/transmission-lines-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Getty Images)The state Department of Education is looking to take over the Marlboro County School District’s finances following a contentious budgeting process, the agency said Thursday.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver also asked the state inspector general to investigate claims of mismanaged purchasing cards, according to a letter she sent Thursday. The letter did not include any more information on the potentially suspicious purchases.
A financial takeover is not the same as a total district takeover, since the local school board would keep its other decision-making powers. The move will need approval from the state Board of Education to take effect. The next board meeting is Aug. 5.
If approved, state officials will be able to change the district’s budget, review hiring decisions, pay vendors and manage spending, according to the agency. If that doesn’t improve matters, the state department could move for full control and fire the school board.
SC takes control of rural school district’s finances

“Our highest priority is ensuring students in Marlboro County have access to a safe, stable, and effective educational environment,” Weaver said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the district’s fiscal condition leaves us no choice but to act.”
Facing a nearly $7 million shortfall in the 3,100-student district’s annual budget, school board members and staff suggested raising local property taxes and consolidating schools operating under capacity, “neither of which resulted in a viable or timely solution,” Weaver wrote in a Thursday letter to the state Board of Education’s chairwoman.
Nearly 88% of the district’s students live in poverty. The district received more than $18,000 per student last school year, with about 11% of that coming from federal aid and 56% coming from the state, according to the latest estimates from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Department of Education officials met with district leaders June 30 and sent a letter a week later expressing the urgency of passing a balanced budget. The department pointed to an increase in staffing numbers despite a decrease in student enrollment and suggested better aligning the two by laying off unnecessary staff members, Weaver wrote.
The school board adopted a budget Wednesday, more than a week after the state’s deadline to do so. That plan would use nearly all of the district’s funds to cover the shortfall, Weaver wrote.
“This outcome, despite extended support and engagement, signals a lack of long-term financial planning and raises serious concerns about the District’s fiscal sustainability,” Weaver wrote. “It also demonstrates that without further intervention, the District may be unable to maintain essential services or restore financial stability.”
The district has been on a fiscal watch, the lowest of three escalating tiers at a state level, on an alternating basis for three of the past five years, Weaver wrote.
Weaver declared a fiscal emergency in the district in February over concerns with the findings in the district’s 2023 financial report. The district failed to submit its most recent report, which would have been due Dec. 1, Weaver wrote in a letter to the school board.
“We welcome the help they are offering us,” said board chair Michael Coachman. He declined to comment further, including on the request to the inspector general.
A district spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Legislators whose districts include the county called the takeover unfortunate but necessary to make sure students in the district are getting the best education possible.
“We owe it to the students and taxpayers of Marlboro County to act responsibly,” freshman Sen. JD Chaplin, a Darlington Republican whose district includes all of Marlboro County, said in a statement.
Rep. Jason Luck, R-Bennettsville, said the $1,500 increases in the state budget for teachers’ salaries need to “mean real results for students.” Marlboro County is among districts that pay teachers no more than the state-set minimums.
“Local control is a cornerstone of our community, and the people of Marlboro County deserve a voice in their schools,” said Luck, a freshman legislator who represents most of Marlboro County. “Still, if the Department of Education’s action is needed to put children first, I pray it is both successful and short-lived.”
Long-time Rep. Jackie “Coach” Hayes, a Dillon Democrat, also gave his support: “The students, teachers, and staff deserve the best and I am glad to partner with the Department to make this happen,” said the retired high school football coach in the neighboring county, who represents the McColl corner of Marlboro County.
State officials took control of Jasper County School District’s finances in December after the district failed to turn in multiple years of financial audits on time, putting federal funding in jeopardy.
Allendale and Williamsburg school districts remain under total control, which can happen if a district consistently receives scores of “unsatisfactory” on its annual report cards, if its accreditation is denied, or if the superintendent decides the district’s turnaround plan is insufficient, according to state law.
Williamsburg County’s local board is moving away from total control. The board, with oversight from the state education department, is searching for a superintendent to replace the one appointed by the state when it assumed control in 2022. That comes after the board got limited decision-making authority back last year.
Allendale County remains under complete control, with no clear timeline as to when local leaders might be able to make decisions again.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/education-savings-1-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A man accused of emailing a death threat to the Queer Straight Alliance at Montana State University and sending vulgar images and slurs to a fellow student pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Missoula.
Rex Wu, 23, pleaded guilty in a plea agreement to felony cyberstalking with the intent to harass or intimidate. He admitted he caused or meant to cause “substantial emotional distress.”
The felony carries a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
In federal court in Missoula, U.S. Magistrate Judge Kathleen DeSoto told Wu she believed a jury of his peers would find him guilty given the evidence the government had collected against him.
As part of the agreement, Wu will give up a number of electronic devices and pay restitution, with the amount to be determined at sentencing.
Sentencing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 6, at the Russell Smith Federal Courthouse in Missoula.
The court hearing helps bring to a close at least one part of a disturbing chapter at Montana’s largest public university.

In spring 2023, the Queer Straight Alliance reported email threats, but members of the club that supports LGBTQ+ students and others told the Board of Regents and the Daily Montanan they felt the administration fell short in responding to their safety concerns.
In October 2023, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights informed MSU it was under investigation for discrimination for “failing to respond appropriately” to the threats and reports of harassment based on sex, race, color and national origin.
The Office for Civil Rights eventually opened six investigations into alleged abuses, and an MSU spokesperson confirmed Thursday the investigations remain open and pending.
MSU declined to comment on the court case.
The emails Wu pleaded guilty to sending spurred some, although not all, of the 20 reports of discrimination students sent to the Office for Civil Rights.
One of the emails sent to the QSA before a dance party in Bozeman and read aloud in court Wednesday said this in part: “If you do not call off your grooming party of young children tonight, we will send someone to the Rialto and send everyone present to an early death in hell.”
Another one referred to the QSA’s “satanic ways” and said this: “True Montanans will not stop until we expel all the groomers and colored people from our campus and great state!”
In the federal court case, Wu also admitted to harassing an MSU student, Alexandra Lin, who brought attention on campus to the threats against QSA and other unrelated discrimination incidents.
Lin confirmed to the Daily Montanan that she is the victim identified as “Student 1” in court records.
One email to Lin, also read aloud in court, had a subject line “killing the ch–k.” Lin is part Taiwanese.
“Hi Ch–-k I have people watching your house day and night,” the email said. “One of these days you will get what’s coming to you. This isn’t Missoula in real Montana we kill g–ks like you.”
Wu also sent pornographic images and videos to Lin, according to court records.
On campus, however, Wu presented himself as aligned with Lin.
Wu helped Lin plan an “Anti-Hate Teach-In” at MSU, according to court records. Wu served as president of the Chinese Culture Club at MSU and testified about the increase of hate crimes on college campuses to the Montana Board of Regents.
He sent the threatening emails using an encrypted email service, ProtonMail, according to court records. An FBI investigation traced the accounts and IP addresses to Wu, who admitted in an interview to sending harassing emails.
In court, Wu stood in front of the judge with his lawyer as Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon read the emails that were part of the evidence the government had gathered. Wu kept one hand over his forehead for much of the time Weldon read the messages.
He ignored a request for comment after the court hearing.
Wu attended MSU until 2023, he said in court. As a condition of his release, Judge DeSoto said Wu would be generally restricted to the northern district of Illinois without explicit and advanced permission to travel.
The Queer Straight Alliance could not be reached for comment on Thursday morning.
In a phone call after the hearing, Lin said she is pleased Wu pleaded guilty. However, she said it’s unfortunate that so few women who are stalked get to see the same result.
Starting this summer, a new president, Brock Tessman, is leading MSU, and Lin said she hopes the culture will change under him. She said MSU administrators and campus police failed to take her concerns seriously.
“You wonder how many people have these experiences and didn’t get help because it didn’t align with the university’s public image,” Lin said.
Former MSU President Waded Cruzado retired in June after 15 years leading the flagship. She earned accolades for significant increases in enrollment and research spending, but criticism from some students and faculty for a controlling leadership style and failing to address safety concerns on campus.
An MSU spokesperson declined to comment on the work of its campus law enforcement.
At the time the emails were sent to the QSA, MSU maintained it investigated the messages and found they did not represent actual danger to students.
Lin said the most disturbing outcome remains the trauma of believing Wu was her friend, and later finding out he was not only the source of harassment, but he helped organize an event to support the people he victimized.
Even days after he signed his plea deal, Lin said, he was still sending her messages. She said she wonders when she meets new people if she can feel safe.
“More than anything, the most upsetting thing through this experience was the lasting emotional and mental impact of being stalked,” Lin said.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Sierra Club announced Thursday that it has broken the world record for the largest display of origami fish in an effort to bring attention to Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline, which passes through northern Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Line 5 has been the target of sustained activism for years, with environmental groups and Native American tribes arguing the pipeline’s continued existence puts the water supply for thousands of residents at risk.
By next year, Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns the pipeline, must reroute a part of the pipeline that runs through a portion of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa tribe’s reservation. As the company works through the permit process for moving the pipeline, the tribe and environmental groups have pushed the state Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers not to approve the permits. 
The tribe says the pipeline’s continued operation, even if it no longer runs across tribal land, will harm water quality in the watershed, encourage the growth of invasive species and damage wetlands, diminishing their ability to filter pollutants out of runoff before reaching surface waters.

At a two-day hearing in May, tribal members testified against the Army Corps’ approval of the permit. A series of hearings are set to be held from August-October on a challenge to the DNR’s permitting decision. 
The Sierra Club organized the origami fish project to  bring attention to the years of activism against Line 5 and the continued fight against its path through the Bad River reservation and under the Straits of Mackinac between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. 
The Trump Administration, as part of its effort to increase production of oil and other fossil fuels, has expedited permit approval of a new pipeline tunnel in Michigan.
The previous origami fish record was 18,303. With the help of folders from all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, the Sierra Club has created a display of more than 70,000 origami fish. On Thursday, the fish were put on display in the Sierra Club of Wisconsin’s Madison office as staff continued pinning them onto boards. A press conference about Line 5’s effect on Wisconsin’s water was held in front of the boards full of paper fish. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) told the Wisconsin Examiner the fish project was a symbol of people’s ability to work together to fight injustice. 
“You topple regimes with people power,” she said.
Hong added that even if the Line 5’s permits are approved, the “fight to protect water has renewed energy” because of it. 
Despite the years of activism and push for the DNR not to approve the permits, there is little the department can do to stop the project. The DNR’s authority is limited so that if the proposed project fits within state laws, the permits must be approved, something that Hong said needs to be changed.
“We certainly have to look at amending those laws and holding polluters responsible, not compromising hundreds, thousands of people’s drinking water for tens or hundreds of jobs,” she said. 
The fish display will be available to view at the Urban Ecology Center in Milwaukee on Saturday.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday voted to settle an ethics case with a former agency head and state Cabinet secretary accused of violating conflict of interest rules.
While the details of the case being settled or the terms of the agreement with Shelley Zumwalt, former Cabinet secretary of tourism, wildlife and heritage for Gov. Kevin Stitt, were not public as of Thursday afternoon, the Commission’s Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone said those will be released once it is signed and executed. 
Zumwalt also previously led the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation and the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. She resigned as head of the Department of Tourism in September following a scathing state audit. 
Zumwalt was required to complete annual forms attesting that no related party transactions existed, and she checked “no” on the forms, according to the audit.
“I want to acknowledge the collaborative efforts of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission and Attorney General’s Office to achieve this outcome,” Zumwalt said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice Thursday afternoon. “Neither my husband nor I financially benefited from the contracts, and there was no finding by the ethics commission of any financial gain.”
Additional Ethics Commission action 
In other business, the Commission on Thursday also voted to pursue an ethics case against the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission in district court and open another formal investigation into state Rep. Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City. 
At the Commission’s June meeting, the board voted to pursue an ethics complaint in district court against Pittman for allegedly violating the terms of a settlement agreement. 
Pittman had agreed to reimburse a total of $35,000 after failing to maintain proper records, improperly withdrawing funds, and using campaign funds for personal use. The Commission alleged she missed payments, leading the Commission to pursue the case in Oklahoma County District Court, Bruce Boone told Oklahoma Voice in June. 
No case had been filed as of Thursday. 
Because of the breach of the settlement agreement and “other reporting inconsistencies,” the Ethics Commission voted to further audit Pittman’s campaign committee’s reporting and transition a complaint into a formal investigation, according to a document made public by the Commission Thursday. 
Pittman did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday afternoon. 
The Ethics Commission also voted unanimously to pursue in district court a separate ethics case against the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission for alleged violations of financial disclosure rules. 
The Ethics Commission said it has been actively investigating the PAC for campaign finance violations for several months, according to a document made public Thursday.
Anthony DeVore, president of the political action committee, did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Thursday. 
DeVore’s group has lobbied at the state Capitol to reduce criminal penalties for cockfighting.

Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed bills cutting taxes on capital gains and diapers and increasing fees for motor vehicle registrations. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri investors will get a tax break when they take profits and motorists will pay more to renew vehicle registrations under separate bills signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
Kehoe’s signature on the bill granting an income tax exemption for long-term capital gains — profits on investments held for a year or longer — marks the third major tax cut in the past three years. And it comes just days after he vetoed more than $300 million in general revenue spending and restricted $211 million more amid worries about sluggish revenues.
In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state took in $13.4 billion in general revenue and final figures show revenue increased just $1 million over the previous year. After Kehoe’s vetoes, the budget for the current fiscal year projects spending $15.5 billion in general revenue, with the gap between revenue and spending covered by surpluses accumulated in past years.
“Conservative leadership is about keeping more money in the hands of Missouri families, and less in government coffers,” Kehoe said in a news release.
The capital gains exemption for individuals is officially estimated to reduce revenue by about $110 million annually. Independent economists, however, have warned that the annual revenue loss could be much more, perhaps as much as $600 million. 
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
When Kehoe finished with the state budget, he warned he was making vetoes and restricting spending because of uncertainty in future state revenues and expenses.
When Kehoe released his budget proposal in January, it anticipated the state would end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion. At that time, the unobligated surplus at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected at $1.4 billion, but during the recent special session state Budget Director Dan Haug told lawmakers he expects no more than half that amount — $600 million to $700 million — will remain on June 30, 2026.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release accompanying the budget actions stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”
Both the vetoes and Haug’s forecast came before Congress finished work on the massive federal budget reconciliation bill signed July 4 by President Donald Trump. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimated Missouri revenue would decline by at least $170 million and possibly by more than $400 million under an earlier version of the bill. 
That estimate has not been updated since the final bill was passed.
The federal budget bill is also expected to shift billions of dollars in costs for programs like food stamps and Medicaid to Missouri over the coming decade.
The liberal Missouri Budget Project, which opposed the tax cut during the session, issued a statement Thursday condemning Kehoe’s decision to sign the bill.
“Prioritizing an expensive special interest tax giveaway at this time is irresponsible and a mismanagement of taxpayer dollars,” CEO Amy Blouin said in a news release. “It’s also a slap in the face to the bulk of Missouri taxpayers who are struggling to afford groceries and who already pay a higher portion of their income in state and local taxes than do the folks who will get a windfall from the capital gains exemption.”
A capital gains exemption for corporations, also included in the bill, would take effect when future revenue growth or legislative action reduces the top individual income tax rate to 4.5% or below. The rate this year is 4.7%, with two reductions of 0.1 percentage point each already included in state law when revenue triggers are met.
The state budget office estimates the earliest date for the next rate cut triggered by revenue would be Jan. 1, 2028.
 Other tax cuts

The bill that includes the capital gains tax cut also includes provisions increasing a refundable income tax credit used by lower-income senior citizens and the disabled to offset property taxes. The increase in what is known as the Circuit Breaker tax credit would bump the maximum credit for homeowners to $1,550 from the current $1,100. Qualifying taxpayers who rent their homes would see their maximum credit increase to $1,055 from $750.
The maximum income for claiming the credit would also increase, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 a year for homeowners.
The increased Circuit Breaker credit was negotiated by Democrats opposed to the capital gains cut. A bipartisan coalition also won sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products, bringing the total official estimate of the tax cut in the coming year to $430 million, with an ongoing revenue reduction of $340 million.
 Registration fees

The Missouri Department of Revenue issues motor vehicle registrations and driver’s licenses through a system of contract offices that make money through fees, set by law, added to the state charge for the transaction. 
There is supposed to be at least one license office in every county, but for much of this year, five counties have had no office because contractors wouldn’t work for the allowed fees.
The bill signed by Kehoe and sponsored by state Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, would increase the fees received by the license offices by 50%.
The goal is to make the offices attractive to contractors and avoid closures, Crawford said during a House committee hearing in April.
“I live in a small town, and if my license bureau were to close, I would likely have to drive 45 minutes, take a half a day to drive and get my license,” Crawford said. “And so I would much rather pay $3 than take off half a day and drive 45 miles or 45 minutes to get this done.”
The transaction fee for a driver’s license or motor vehicle would go from $6 to $9 for the shortest period and from $12 to $18 for the longest, six years for a driver’s license and two years for a vehicle registration.
In fiscal 2024, the 175 license offices processed almost 9 million transactions and charged $58.4 million in fees. 
The smallest, in Unionville in Putnam County on the Iowa border, generated $28,736 in fees on 4,519 transactions. There is currently no contractor for the Unionville office and it has been closed since mid-April.
The busiest license office is in Creve Coeur in St. Louis County, where 167,390 transactions generated almost $1.1 million in fee revenue.

Mike Kehoe.
The new benefit, linked to an increase in the minimum wage passed with 58% of the vote in November, became a target for business lobbying interests. Republican allies in the General Assembly pushed it to Kehoe’s desk by invoking a rarely used state Senate rule to shut down debate over Democratic objections.
The action followed a pattern established over the past 15 years where conservative Republicans have used their majorities in the legislature to roll back or repeal measures that became law through initiatives pushed to the ballot by progressive groups.
The minimum wage initiative was a statutory change, meaning lawmakers could make any changes that would command a majority. 
In a news release issued after he signed the bills, Kehoe said he was approving the bill to defend small businesses.
“Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work—families, job creators, and small business owners—by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Kehoe said in the release.
Missouri House Democratic leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City denounced Kehoe’s decision to sign the bill as an attack on workers and voters.
“The governor’s action today demonstrates the absolute disdain Republicans have for working Missourians,” Aune said in a news release. “But in stripping workers of their legal right to earned sick leave, the governor and his allies have probably guaranteed this issue will be back on the ballot next year as a constitutional amendment that will place worker protections beyond their reach.”
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for the paid sick leave law, has filed a proposed constitutional amendment targeting the 2026 ballot.
The repeal doesn’t take effect immediately because Republicans were unable to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to pass an emergency clause even though the GOP holds more than two-thirds of the seats in each chamber. It goes into effect at the same time as other bills approved this year and signed by Kehoe.
The increased minimum wage, $13.75 an hour, took effect on Jan. 1. A second increase is set for Jan. 1, 2026, when it will increase to $15 an hour. The bill signed Thursday also repeals a provision, in effect since 2006, to adjust the minimum wage annually for inflation.
Organizers of the initiative that put the measure on the ballot set May 1 as the starting date for paid leave, available for personal illness or to stay home with a sick family member. The intent was to allow more time for businesses to adjust to the new rule than the short period between the election and the new year.
Workers at businesses with receipts greater than $500,000 a year are accruing at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.
The leave can be used currently, but the repeal makes it uncertain if accrued leave can be used after the law is repealed.
The battle over the leave provisions revolved around its economic effect, pitting business interests and their backers in the legislature against supporters of the law. 
During a House committee hearing in February, the sponsor, Republican state Rep. Sherri Gallick of Belton, suggested that employees can’t be trusted to use paid sick leave only for the reasons allowed by the law.
“Under the mandated sick leave, potential abuse is nearly impossible to address,” Gallick told the House Commerce Committee. “Employers cannot ask an employee why they were absent, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits for merely inquiring.”
In a news release Thursday, Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the mandated paid sick leave a “job killer.”
“Missouri employers value their employees and recognize the importance of offering competitive wages and benefits, but one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth,” Corches said in the release.
At a May news conference, state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said that when Missouri workers are successful, businesses will succeed.
“The idea that providing workers with more protections is a business killer is wild,” she said. “…To try to make this seem like this is something that will kill business, that will keep businesses from opening, I think it’s absurd, and I think it’s quite disappointing, and I think it sends absolutely the wrong message.”
The action on sick leave is similar to a bill in 2011 weakening provisions of a ballot measure from 2010 called the “Puppy Mill Cruelty and Prevention Act,” that specified appropriate living conditions for breeding operations and including action this year to overturn the abortion rights amendment approved in November. 
The GOP’s willingness to overturn voter actions has led many initiative organizers to push their proposals as constitutional amendments, which require a statewide vote to repeal or revise. Amendments to legalize marijuana, expand Medicaid coverage, revise the legislative redistricting process and protect abortion rights have all been passed as constitutional amendments.
The Republican majority has responded by successfully pushing a second revision of redistricting and placing an abortion rights repeal on the 2026 ballot. A court challenge to Medicaid expansion was rejected by the Missouri Supreme Court.

(Rendering courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)The University of Northern Iowa is considering community wishes and studying successful development projects as it takes its first steps in creating its own mixed-use area to benefit both campus and the Cedar Valley area, university officials say.
The Cedar Falls university has launched the Panther District project with a search for a developer to help transform land close to UNI athletics and events centers into a pedestrian, bike and family-friendly space with restaurants, retail spaces and housing options.
Pete Moris, UNI director of university relations, said in an interview one of the goals behind the district is to boost already-growing development and provide additional amenities on the west side of Cedar Falls, benefiting both the city and the college.
“We did not want to compete with downtown or Cedar Falls if this project was simply going to draw dollars from one area to a different area,” Moris said. “We wanted to be able to help infuse Cedar Falls with a project that would benefit the entire community.”

The development will sit across the street from the UNI-Dome and McLeod Center, which hosts athletic and other events. UNI will continue owning the land where the development will be, according to the project website, with the developer leasing it to “implement, finance, operate, and maintain” the structures within the district.
As the project is still in its early stages, Moris said an official design of the district has not been decided upon, but the university and developer will work together on options once a company is selected. Once a developer is selected, Moris said the university will seek necessary approvals from the Iowa Board of Regents.
Aspects of the district the university wants to see put in place include restaurants, temporary lodging, housing and retail businesses, with open spaces to invite people in and bring UNI, growing neighborhoods in the area and the recently built high school closer together.
“Right now we’ve kind of got an idea, but I think that pedestrian, bike friendly, family friendly … those are elements we do feel pretty strongly about to anchor the project,” Moris said.
Housing for the project would be market-rate and aimed at people who work in the area, Moris said.
The consulting firm hired to determine whether a project like the Panther District could be viable had previous experience working with downtown Cedar Falls, Moris said. The firm found that with projected population growth and tourism, the city would be able to handle the district without fears of hurting or shuttering other businesses.

Katy Susong, president and CEO of Grow Cedar Valley, said the College Hill District that sits a few minutes away from the proposed development space could also see further investment and development, leading to general improvements to the whole area.
Excitement for more development can be found across the Cedar Valley region, Susong said, as well as a readiness for the community to be more closely tied to the college.
“I think this is a tremendous opportunity to really create an inviting corridor into Cedar Falls that shows all of the great things we have going on, but demonstrates that we are Panther Town,” Susong said. “We are a college community, and hopefully this development will make that abundantly clear.”
Grow Cedar Valley has had conversations with university staff about plans for the project, and Susong said there should be “opportunities to work together in meaningful ways” in the future as the process moves forward.
Other resources UNI has tapped in the creation of the proposed district include similar projects that have seen success, including Titletown in Green Bay, Wis. The community development, which boasts housing, a health clinic, restaurants, entertainment and a large park, was also scrutinized by Iowa State University in the early development of its multi-use district, CyTown, Iowa State University Research Park President Rick Sanders said.
Moris said UNI has looked at the CyTown project to see if there were any takeaways that could be applied to the Panther District, and Sanders said it looks like “they’re starting the process wonderfully.” He saw similarities between the two projects when he perused the Panther District Request for Qualifications, and he would be happy to work with the fellow Iowa institution to share what he’s learned.
In addition to ensuring partnerships are made and kept between the city and business communities, advice Sanders gave to the UNI staff working on the district is to make sure processes and people are prepared to face challenges, including when the university has to operate outside of its regular practices.
“The university is fantastic at doing what the university does, but this is not what the university is used to doing,” Sanders said. “So if you try to shoehorn a project like this into traditional university processes, I think you’re going to find some very real challenges.”

Police received a call from a resident at a home on Hollister Quarry Road about the death of an individual, and they began the investigation at about 2:10 a.m Wednesday, according to a press release from state police. 
The death is considered suspicious, and the person’s identity has not been released yet. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington is expected to conduct an autopsy on the victim’s body to determine the cause and manner of death.
The results of the autopsy haven’t been released, and police did not have anyone in custody as of Thursday afternoon. 
Adam Silverman, a spokesperson for Vermont State Police, said he did not have any additional information to release as of 1:30 p.m. Thursday.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)The five Democratic state lawmakers who were denied entrance to inspect the new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades last week filed a lawsuit in the Florida Supreme Court against Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Department of Emergency (FDEM) Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie on Thursday.
They contend that their exclusion from the facility violated state law as well as the Florida Constitution by eroding the separation of powers and improperly restricting the authority of a co-equal branch of government.
State Sens. Shevin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith and state Reps. Michele Rayner, Anna Eskamani, and Angie Nixon are the plaintiffs in the case. The five Democratic lawmakers attempted to enter the facility on July 3, but were denied entrance for what officials there claimed were “safety concerns” that the Democratic lawmakers say were never identified to them.
Their attempt to visit the facility came two days after President Donald Trump, Gov. DeSantis, and several other state Republican officials held a tour and roundtable discussion at the center with members of the media
Officials with FDEM said earlier this week that state statute grants inspection authority only to legislative committees, “not to individual legislators engaging in political theater.” They also said that while Florida Statute 944.23 does authorize members of the Legislature to visit state correctional institutions, they have to be those under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections.
“The Alligator Alcatraz facility is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and does not otherwise fall within the statutory definition of a ‘state correctional institution,’” said FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman, referring to the appellation given the facility by state leaders.
During the roundtable discussion on July 1 when the facility was opened to the media, Gov. DeSantis described the detention center as a “one-stop shop” with a runway that will allow the federal government to carry out deportation flights. The governor used a state of emergency declaration he issued in January 2023 to take over and begin the speedy construction on the land Miami-Dade County owns.
The five Democrat allege in their lawsuit that under Florida Statutes 944.23 and 951.225, members of the Legislature are explicitly entitled to conduct unannounced visits to any state or local detention facility at their “pleasure.”
They also contend that DeSantis and Guthrie undermined the State Emergency Management Act under which the governor derives his emergency powers. They are seeking a writ to compel DeSantis and and Guthrie “to provide immediate, unannounced access to the Petitioners to the Dade-Collier Training & Transition Airport site of the proclaimed ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention facility.”
The department announced on Wednesday that it will open the center for all state lawmakers and members of Congress this Saturday for a 90-minute visit.
 Reports of poor conditions
The filing of the lawsuit followed news reports of poor conditions at the 3,000 person-capacity tent and trailer detention center. Multiple detainees told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they had gone days without showering, the toilets didn’t flush, and temperatures fluctuated between extremes.
“The rule of law must be upheld,” the lawsuit states.
“Our Constitution does not coronate a king. It is not hyperbolic to contend that the Governor’s actions, directly or indirectly through the actions of agency directors and their employees, could become more far reaching into the third branch of our government. Conjecture is not necessary at this moment because the distinctive and autonomous power of the legislative branch has and is being challenged by and through the executive branch. The blatant, illegal, and cavalier nature of violation of the Florida Constitution and statutory authority puts members of the legislative and judicial branches at risk if we, those sworn to protect and defend the Constitution and rule of law, do not speak out loudly and boldly against its trespasses and transgressors.”
The lawsuit was filed by two Democratic members of the Florida House, attorneys Ashley Gantt and LaVon Bracy Davis. Along with Rep. Rayner, the three female Democratic lawmakers announced last month that they were forming their own law firm called BDGR P.A.
Two environmental groups, Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, have already gone to federal court to sue the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), FDEM, and Miami-Dade County alleging construction of the detention center violates a federal law that requires environmental analysis of potential harms and that the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
The Phoenix has reached out to the governor’s office and FDEM for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-10 20:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,New Canaan case marks victory for affordable housing advocates,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/10/new-canaan-8-30g-weed-street/,A judge ruled that the New Canaan Planning & Zoning Commission improperly denied a proposal to build affordable housing units.,"In a victory for advocates of Connecticut’s affordable housing law, a Superior Court judge last week ruled that the New Canaan Planning & Zoning Commission improperly denied a proposal to build a 102-unit apartment complex that included 31 affordable units.
The 98-page decision refuted concerns commonly raised by opponents of such developments and emphasized that all towns bear some responsibility for meeting housing needs in the state.
The ruling, issued in Superior Court in Hartford, says that the planning and zoning commission must approve the construction after the developer makes a couple of minor tweaks to the proposal to build on Weed Street in New Canaan.
The property is in a residential neighborhood, less than half a mile from the New Canaan train station. It previously had a 10,000-square-foot single-family home and separate pool house, which have been demolished. The current property owner first applied in 2022 to change the zoning and build apartments and made several adjustments to the plan. It was denied in November 2022.
The developer contested the denial under a Connecticut affordable housing law commonly known by its statutory name — 8-30g. That law allows developers whose affordable housing proposals are denied to sue and force local officials to prove that they declined the proposal for health or safety reasons.
Towns are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing is designated affordable, and they can apply for temporary reprieves as they make progress toward that goal.
Tim Hollister, the land use attorney who represented developer Arnold Karp, said the town had raised concerns about fire safety, stormwater management and pedestrian safety to deny the application, although the evidence was “very clear” that it should have been approved, he said.
Judge Edward V. O’Hanlan addressed those concerns in detail in his ruling.
“The [New Canaan Planning & Zoning] commission has not met its burden to prove that its denial was necessary to protect these public interests, or that these public interests as identified outweighed the need for affordable housing and could not be protected by reasonable changes to the site plan,” he wrote.
“Why did they [deny the proposal]?” Hollister said. “I think it’s because of the dynamic we see with local zoning, with 169 towns, each having its own zoning power and zoning jurisdiction. The local nature of zoning reinforces the status quo and makes commissions very subject to local opposition. I think it’s almost paralyzing.”
New Canaan’s Planning and Zoning Commission did not respond to requests for comment.
The one-bedroom affordable units in the complex would rent to people with a maximum income of $50,670 who would pay a maximum rent of $1,142, according to court documents. Two-bedroom units would be available for maximum incomes of $55,566 and would rent at $1,370 per month, excluding utilities.
New Canaan, where the median annual household income is $163,355, was granted a moratorium earlier this year that temporarily exempts it from lawsuits under 8-30g. The moratorium, which was issued because the town was making progress in building affordable housing, came after a lengthy court battle with the state. 
The Weed Street case, which began more than two years ago, predated the moratorium.
The decision is victory for affordable housing and 8-30g advocates but comes during a moment of political turmoil for housing policy in Connecticut. 
During the last legislative session, Democratic lawmakers worked with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to create the most significant reform to Connecticut’s housing law in years. That bill passed, but under pressure from local officials, Lamont sided with Republicans and vetoed the measure.
Democrats say they’ll come back into special session this year to make adjustments to the bill. Lamont’s proposed changes, which are likely to be incorporated in a new bill, include ways to make it easier for towns to achieve 8-30g moratoriums if they build more housing near train and bus stations.
It was controversial among housing advocates who said the measure weakened 8-30g, and Lamont has since said he’s unsure whether he would have supported the decades-old law if it were proposed today.
Hollister said this case shows the importance of the law and is unique in a few ways. Most judges’ decisions in cases like this aren’t as thorough as the ruling issued earlier this month, he said.
“The court decision reaffirms that 8-30g is an important tool,” Hollister said. “It’s a way to overcome exclusionary zoning, but it also shows that it’s a tool to overcome local opposition.”
The decision also refutes at least the idea that an understaffed fire department is a reason to deny affordable housing, which is frequently cited as a factor in arguments opposing affordable housing development, he said.
One of the town’s arguments was that its fire department didn’t have the capacity to fight fires in the multistory building. The developer argued that the town regularly relies on help from nearby fire departments, and the court agreed.
“These choices [to rely on mutual aid] are for the town to make, but not sufficiently tied to legitimate fire safety concerns of the commission, so as to forbid someone’s use of their land, much less to be said to outweigh the need for affordable housing,” the judge’s ruling said.
In one of its briefs, which Hollister said was a newer argument, the commission also said that the amount of affordable housing in nearby cities should be a factor that eases the need and goals to build more affordable housing in New Canaan.
“This argument is antithetical — even repugnant — to the policy reasons behind Connecticut’s affordable housing law,” the judge wrote in a footnote in his ruling. 
“Again, the commission points to no statutory language or case law authority that allows the town, literally, to pawn off its responsibility onto other municipalities, or to claim credit for their greater success in meeting that policy. Indeed, each town or city shares an equal burden.”

Makamy, who was pregnant at the time of her death, is one of four youths  to die under CYFD’s watch since April.
Details about Makamy’s life are scarce at this stage. Foster and adoptive parents, counselors and relatives who knew her did not respond to requests to speak to a reporter for this story.	

This article first appeared on Searchlight New Mexico and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.


Case files obtained by Searchlight show that Makamy was struggling in the weeks before her death. She was upset about having to leave her home community in southeastern New Mexico for foster placements, and was specifically unhappy about being sent to stay in CYFD office buildings, where the department often sends children to sleep when case workers can’t find a suitable foster home. In late April, she was taken from a CYFD office to Springer, a five-and-a-half-hour drive from her hometown of Hobbs. She died there three weeks later. A memorial service was held for Makamy in Hobbs in early June. She leaves behind a boyfriend and at least one sibling.
“She was a couch surfer, she bounced from house to house,” said Randy Pettigrew, a Republican state representative from Lea County who has had access to CYFD documentation on Makany’s case. “She had a multitude of office stays. She was listed as a runaway multiple times” while dealing with significant mental health challenges, he said. At least one of the foster homes she was assigned to was not properly licensed by CYFD, Pettigrew said.

Makamy’s case worker had asked for help finding mental health providers in the area, according to the documents obtained by Searchlight. The documents do not say whether she received those services.
Before taking her life, she wrote “Do not save me” on her arm, the documents say.
CYFD declined to comment on Makany’s death, saying in an email that because the case “is still under active investigation, it would be premature for CYFD to respond at this time.”
The tragedy comes as CYFD faces scathing criticism from state legislators, who say the agency has failed to protect New Mexico’s most vulnerable children. In the most recent session, lawmakers passed several significant bills aimed at increasing oversight and transparency at the agency.
Much of the criticism centers on the agency’s lack of progress in fulfilling promises it made under the 2020 settlement of the Kevin S. lawsuit, a class action suit which claimed the state’s child welfare system was “locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental and behavioral health.”
As part of that settlement, CYFD agreed to stop housing its foster youth in group settings and to provide them with adequate mental health care. But the department has failed year after year to meet its commitments to those promises, according to independent monitors — failures that were highlighted yet again in an arbitration hearing last week.
Instead, CYFD has continued to house children with serious mental and behavioral health needs in youth homeless shelters and its office buildings, where they have been sexually assaulted, injured by armed guards and exposed to fentanyl and other drugs.
Those placements have been particularly harmful for teenagers like Makamy. A 2022 investigation by Searchlight and ProPublica found that many teens in foster care — a group that CYFD has an especially hard time placing in stable homes — spend their teenage years shuffling between shelters and offices without receiving adequate mental health services. These teenagers experience drastic declines in their mental health amid such instability, often culminating in violent outbursts, suicide attempts and other crises.
In two episodes now, which happened barely a month apart, teenagers who had been repeatedly shuffled through offices and shelters have died by suicide. In April, Jaydun Garcia, a 16-year-old who was beloved by his peers in foster care, took his life at a makeshift home in Albuquerque for youth who lack foster placements. Two other children involved with CYFD, both of them infants, have died since June.
“I’m profoundly sad, we should all be profoundly sad, that we’ve seen two children in state custody take their own lives because they felt so hopeless and so alone,” said Maralyn Beck, executive director of New Mexico Child First Network, a foster care advocacy organization. “I don’t think there’s any problem facing New Mexico that’s more serious, with life-altering consequences, than the crisis that is our child protective services.”
Garcia’s death prompted intense outcry among advocates, attorneys and legislators — as well as an investigation by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. A spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Justice, the agency overseen by Torrez, said that investigators are currently examining Makany Anderson’s death as well.“We are aware of the recent tragic incident involving a young individual in Springer, New Mexico,” Lauren Rodriguez, chief of staff at the department, said in an email to Searchlight. “Our office is actively reviewing the circumstances surrounding this case. We urge anyone with information about the individual’s history or events leading up to their death to contact the New Mexico Department of Justice.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/searchlight_nm_2-1-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, said he has asked Attorney General Gentner Drummond to weigh in on whether the decision to stop patrolling in Oklahoma and Tulsa areas are constitutional, while Rep. Ross Ford, R-Broken Arrow, said he plans to conduct further investigations into the reallocation of coverage. 
The Department of Public Safety announced last week that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol will stop providing law enforcement coverage in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City and instead shift resources to areas with the “greatest need” by Nov. 1. Local law enforcement in those cities will bear the responsibility of upholding the law on interstates and highways.
Ford, a former Tulsa Police officer who also serves as chair on the House public safety budget subcommittee, said he opposes “pulling manpower from these densely populated areas.
“There has to be a better way to address the department’s concerns that doesn’t involve putting citizens in danger,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Ford said he worries about increased incidents of driving under the influence and unattended collisions on interstate highways. He said troopers patrolling the highways saves lives, and the city of Tulsa should not have to “address the areas of shortage” left by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol’s absence.
Sarah Stewart, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, said Thursday that the agency was not commenting further or answering additional questions about the policy change beyond an initial statement released last week announcing the upcoming changes.
Mann said in a statement that local police are already overburdened and under-resourced. 
“Shifting the responsibility of responding to incidents and accidents on interstate highways to local agencies will only exacerbate the serious challenges they already face,” he said.
Mann said he’s asked Drummond to issue an opinion addressing who is responsible under state law for patrolling highways and interstates. He said if that is found to be a responsibility of the Highway Patrol,  he wants Drummond to determine whether the Department of Public Safety can cease enforcement, and if the state Constitution compels Oklahoma’s governor to require the agency to continue its enforcement responsibilities.  
Phil Bacharach, a spokesperson for Drummond, said in a statement that as soon as the attorney general was aware of the reallocation plan, he began to determine its legality. He also confirmed Drummond received Sen. Mann’s request for a legal opinion, but did not have an estimated response time. 
Opinions issued by the Attorney General’s Office are typically legally binding until overturned by a court.

Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is nearing the end of two terms as the state’s chief executive. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A new Rutgers-Eagleton poll says a wide majority of New Jerseyans are not satisfied with the state’s handling of two key economic issues, just four months before voters choose a new governor.
The poll found that 85% of residents are dissatisfied with the state’s approach to affordability and the cost of living, while 80% feel the same about taxes. They are split when asked about the states’ handling of the economy and jobs, with 48% saying they are dissatisfied and 44% saying they are satisfied. Satisfaction on that issue has dropped by 11 points in the last three years.
“New Jerseyans are in a state of malaise when it comes to how Trenton is handling a number of key statewide issues,” Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said in a statement. “There isn’t a single issue where a significant majority is satisfied, even those that have historically proven to be feathers in the state government’s cap.”
New Jerseyans’ views on other issues improve somewhat, but remain mixed. Fifty-seven percent are dissatisfied when it comes to the state budget and government spending and 54% are dissatisfied with transportation and infrastructure. As for education and schools, 47% are satisfied, a double-digit decline on this issue since 2022.
Nearly half of New Jerseyans say state is on wrong track, new poll says

Voters are also split on Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is nearing the end of two terms as the state’s chief executive. The poll gives him a 43% favorability rating (40% unfavorable) and a 47% job approval rating (38% disapproval). Both his favorability and job approval ratings have trended downward since the fall.
“New Jersey’s discontent sets the stage for an interesting governor’s race ahead, where frustration with both state and national politics will compete for the spotlight — and ultimately, for votes,” Koning said.
Murphy is barred from seeking a third term in November. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) are vying to succeed him.
Though dissatisfaction was high across the board, Republicans and independent voters were found to be more negative than Democrats.
“Independents are dissatisfied with politics at both the state and national level, so candidate messaging and focus will prove crucial here to courting this ever-important voting bloc,” Koning said.
President Donald Trump is expected to be a key issue in November’s gubernatorial race, with Sherrill hammering Ciattarelli for his support of the president and Ciattarelli knocking Sherrill for her focus on Trump.
The new Rutgers-Eagleton poll found low approval ratings for Trump in New Jersey — just 30% of respondents have a favorable view of him, versus 59% with an unfavorable view. Ten percent have no opinion. Trump’s job approval numbers mirror his favorability ratings.
“Both Murphy and Trump will loom large over this year’s governor’s race, and early indicators of who might play a bigger role or have a more positive or negative influence are a mixed bag right now,” Koning said.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults surveyed between June 13 and June 16.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
After fatal weather-related disasters battered three states over the past week, President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the country’s top weather research agency told lawmakers Wednesday that he supports the administration’s calls to slash its budget—and he failed to directly acknowledge the impact of climate change on extreme weather.
The Trump administration tapped Neil Jacobs, a meteorologist from North Carolina, five months ago to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Jacobs held the job in an acting capacity during the first Trump administration.
On Wednesday, during a nomination hearing held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Jacobs faced questions about whether and how he would improve forecasting and climate research as the administration calls for cutting NOAA’s budget by nearly 30 percent.
“Neil is a hugely competent meteorologist with a lot of experience in numeric weather forecasting,” Rick Spinrad, the former head of NOAA during the Biden administration, told Inside Climate News. “I worry about his understanding of the full spectrum of NOAA responsibilities.”
In his opening remarks, Jacobs did not mention climate change once, nor did he mention its impact on weather patterns. When asked about climate change by Democratic committee members, he acknowledged human influence but also mentioned natural variability as a factor—a standard offramp for climate deniers.
“He should understand the relationship between climate and weather, but I didn’t hear anything in the hearing suggesting he would invest in that area,” Spinrad said. “We know that there’s a lot more energy in the system, more moisture. So how are we going to position ourselves to take advantage of that knowledge and protect people from severe storms in the future?”
Since Trump took office in January, the agency has lost roughly 2,000 employees to resignations, early retirements and layoffs. The National Weather Service, which operates under NOAA, has lost 600 employees.
The proposed budget cuts and workforce reductions have come under scrutiny in recent days after catastrophic flooding in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico. The flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas’ Hill Country claimed the lives of more than 115 people, including at least 27 at a 100-year-old girls summer camp, Camp Mystic. At least 173 more people were still missing on Wednesday. Flooding in North Carolina on Sunday killed at least six people. On Tuesday, flash floods killed at least three people in Ruidoso, New Mexico.
Carlos Martinez, a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the National Weather Service did a “fine job” of issuing warnings before the Texas flood, but noted that several key jobs are currently vacant.
“There are lots of questions there,” Martinez said. “Had there been those key positions—even though they did a fine job—would that have helped? I believe the National Weather Service is under stress.”
  Neil Jacobs, President Donald Trump’s choice to lead NOAA, testifies during a nomination hearing held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on Wednesday. (Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation webcast)
The committee chairperson, Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has actively stoked climate change denial while serving in Congress, told the committee in his opening remarks that he visited Camp Mystic on Monday.
“The devastation was the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen,” Cruz said. “The Guadalupe River is normally a quiet and peaceful river. I’ve been swimming and floating in that river dozens of times.”
He then asked Jacobs what he would “do to better ensure that Americans are aware of and able to respond to emergency weather warnings, especially those that arrive in the middle of the night,” as the Guadalupe River flooding did.
Jacobs replied that the Weather Service “did a great job, but there’s a lot of things I would love to improve. Obviously, weather forecasting being one of them.” Over the course of the hearing, he said he intended to modernize NOAA’s radio system and use satellite systems to send out warning messages.
Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said NOAA is a “hugely important institution,” especially given the increasing number of costly weather disasters that hit the country every year. “Natural disasters cost us over $182 billion in damages last year alone,” Hickenlooper said. “So just a thumbs up or thumbs down. … Do you think we’re spending too much money on the science, the research, around NOAA, or are we spending too little?”
Jacobs replied: “I don’t know that you can spend too much on the research.”
Yet when asked by committee members if he supported the Trump budget proposal, Jacbos said he did. The proposal undercuts essential climate and weather research across a range of programs by about $2.2 billion in the 2026 fiscal year.
The proposed cuts would eliminate NOAA’s regional climate data centers, a network of state labs and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), which oversees research at the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, among other labs, and informs much of the agency’s weather-related functions.
The National Weather Service would see an increase under the Trump proposal, but only because it would absorb research programs being cut and transferred from OAR.
“Dr. Jacobs’ testimony revealed a fundamental disconnect between his stated support for NOAA’s mission in weather, water, and climate, and his endorsement of a budget that would dismantle the very scientific infrastructure necessary to carry it out,” Martinez wrote in an email.
Despite Jacobs’ role in a 2019 controversy colloquially known as “Sharpiegate,” he was only quizzed about it once on Wednesday, by Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).
In 2019, Trump claimed that Hurricane Dorian was on a path to hit Alabama. When meteorologists at a state weather bureau refuted the information, NOAA released a statement supporting the president’s claim. The president then displayed a NOAA map at a briefing that appeared to have been altered with a black marker to show the hurricane hitting Alabama.
An investigation later found that Jacobs, who was then the acting NOAA administrator, violated the agency’s scientific integrity policy by supporting the statement.
“I just had people—constituents—die in New Mexico. We had constituents die in Texas,” Luján said Wednesday. “Would you sign off on an inaccurate statement due to political pressure in the same event, yes or no?”
“No,” Jacobs replied.
Others are not entirely convinced.
“I do have concerns as a result of the Sharpiegate scandal,” Martinez said. “This hurricane season, future hurricane seasons—will he communicate the science and what his scientists and forecasters are presenting, or will he cave to political pressure as he did, unfortunately, during the first Trump administration?”
The Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to vote tomorrow on whether it will include the administration’s cuts in its funding bill.

The operator of the New England power grid released a study saying a 10-year downturn in consumption of electricity from the region’s generating plants is coming to an end and giving way to the need for more electricity production over the next decade. 
The post Grid operator forecasting 11% increase in electricity consumption by 2034  appeared first on Com[...]","A LONG-EXPECTED SHIFT in New England electricity consumption – from using less power each year to consuming more as residents embrace electric vehicles and heat pumps – is beginning to happen, but the shift isn’t expected to be quite as dramatic as forecasters were predicting just a year ago. 
The operator of the New England power grid released a study on Thursday saying a 10-year downturn in consumption of electricity from the region’s generating plants is coming to an end and giving way to the need for more electricity production over the next decade.  
A year ago, ISO New England forecast a 17 percent increase in consumption of electricity generated by the region’s power plants by 2033. The latest report, citing a slowdown in electric vehicle and electric heat pump adoption rates, pares back the increase to 11 percent by 2034. 
The shift is still fairly dramatic. According to the grid operator, electricity consumption steadily increased between 1995 and 2005, as the region experienced economic growth and New Englanders installed air conditioning in their homes and businesses. That trend reversed after 2005 as many residents reduced their consumption of electricity from power plants by embracing energy efficiency measures and by meeting all or some of their own power needs by installing solar panels. 
Energy efficiency and home-grown solar production are continuing. Overall, solar power production in New England is forecasted to grow 88 percent over the next decade to 14,343 megawatts. Massachusetts is the leader, expected to generate 6,952 megawatts by 2034.  
Still, ISO New England predicts the growth in solar and energy savings from efficiency measures will not be enough to offset the forecasted increased demand for electricity to power vehicles and home heating systems. The regional grid operator is forecasting that the electrification of the transportation and heating sectors will boost summer peak demand by 68 megawatts in 2025 and 956 megawatts by 2034. Peak demand during the winter heating season is expected to rise by 300 megawatts in 2025 and 6,529 megawatts by 2034. 
Those increases are being predicted even though the Trump administration in Washington is pulling back support for electric vehicle, heat pump, and solar power subsidies. 
The New England grid operator is forecasting that “net” electricity use – which is defined as electricity imported into the region or generated locally but not including solar home installations – will hit 130,665 gigawatt hours by 2034. That’s up from 116,813 gigawatt hours in 2024 and below the 2005 peak of 136,425 gigawatt hours. 
ISO New England is not currently sounding alarms about its ability to secure enough electricity to meet future demand growth. A spokeswoman for the grid operator said it is currently counting on the construction of two offshore wind farms – Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts and Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island. Both wind farms are currently under construction and haven’t been blocked by the Trump administration, which opposes the development of offshore wind.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Researchers at the University of South Florida estimate there were 200,000 victims of sex trafficking in the state in 2024. 
A research lab at the university developed what it called a “first-of-its-kind” report, commissioned by the state, looking at the prevalence of trafficking in the Sunshine State. 
In addition, the report estimates there were 540,000 victims of labor exploitation or trafficking last year. 
Of those sex trafficked, USF estimates, half were minors. 
“We believe this annual report will make a substantial impact on anti-trafficking efforts, resulting in many adults and children being spared from the devastating consequences of human trafficking and many survivors receiving safe and effective assistance,” said Sen. Darryl Rouson, the appropriations sponsor of the lab, in a news release. 
The report is a result of SB 7064, a 2023 law that made USF’s Trafficking In Persons lab the state repository for data compiled by state agencies such as the Department of Children and Families and Department of Juvenile Justice, plus nonprofit organizations. The law is set to expire in 2026, although lawmakers may vote to extend the program. 
The 140+ page report details demographics of victims, the legal system as it relates to the crimes, community resources, and state agency support.
“A report like this had not been done in the past because it seemed impossible to gather all these strands of data located with so many different organizations,” said Joan Reid, director of the lab and a criminology professor at USF. “We are extremely grateful for both the state mandate to collect all this data and the funding to make it a reality and support the state’s ongoing response to combat trafficking.”
Of the incident reporting data from Florida Department of Law Enforcement, 84% of victims in the last three years were female and 14% were male. Of the offenders, those numbers were flipped nearly identically, 83% male, 16% female.

The report also detailed the results of human trafficking screenings, a 2014 measure that looks to identify and locate youth who may be victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The Department of Juvenile Justice conducted 8,527 human trafficking screenings in 2024. Of those, nearly 8,000 were considered likely not or definitely not a victim. Many of those at least likely to be a victim were identified as running away excessively and potentially trafficked or sexually exploited. 
The report says that Florida is “at the forefront in human trafficking policy, with penalties that far exceed the national average,” referencing that the maximum sentence for convictions of human trafficking crimes is life imprisonment. 
FDLE reported 90 human trafficking arrests in 2024.

Which cities?
Data within the report show that 340,389 commercial sex ads were posted in the state during a 90-day window last year. The cities with the most sex ads per resident were Cocoa Beach, Pensacola, Destin, St. Augustine, Fort Walton Beach, Panama City, and Naples. 
Jacksonville had the most total commercial sex ads with well more than double the next closest city, Orlando, followed by Tampa, Pensacola, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Myers. 
Human trafficking, the report states, “operates on basic market principles: where this is demand, traffickers supply,” and that ads reflect demand.

The report compiled the number of illicit massage businesses in the state, facade businesses that are considered to lure victims into sex and labor trafficking. The cities with the most illicit massage businesses per resident were Naples, Orange Park, Port Richey, and North Palm Beach. The cities with the highest number of illicit massage businesses were Orlando, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Pompano Beach, and West Palm Beach. 
Between 2019-2024, Broward County had the highest number of illicit massage businesses each year, according to the report, followed by Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties.
The report said Florida is “especially susceptible to human trafficking” “[d]ue to its high population, the number of major cities that host national and international events, prevalence of airports and ports, and major industries such as agriculture, tourism and entertainment.”

President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly six million jobs nationally, including 150,000 in Pennsylvania, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states. According to the analysis, Pennsylvania would see 65,00 immigrant job losses and 50,000 U.S.-born job losses.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. That includes 20,000 construction jobs lost in Pennsylvania, including 8,000 U.S.-born workers.
The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.

Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

July 10, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers on Thursday walked back their approval for a proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy to better fund the state’s public schools following a controversy surrounding changes to the petition language. 
Daniel Ziegler, an attorney representing the opposing Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike, opened the board meeting with a request, asking members to rescind their approval of the summary language for the Invest in MI Kids petition, saying the proposal’s committee altered the petition language hours before the public comment period closed.
As a result, Ziegler argued the group evaded public comment on the updated petition, leading to the board considering and approving a 100-word summary at their June 27 meeting based on the wrong version of the petition, which was not subject to public comment. Additionally, there was no public comment during the meeting, Ziegler noted, arguing it failed to receive input on both the front and back end.

After going into closed session for a little over half an hour, acting Director of Elections Adam Fracassi laid out the timeline on the group’s petition submissions, telling the board the initial request for a constitutional amendment was received and put out for public comment on June 10. However, the group submitted revised language for the petition on June 16, with public comment set to close on June 17. 
Both the June 16, and a later June 20 submission had been altered to exclude the word public from the phrase “local public school districts,” with the group’s attorney Olivia Flower noting that Michigan law uses the term “local school district.” 
Fracassi said that the final version of the petition was not available online until June 24.
The board unanimously voted to rescind its approval of the petition’s 100-word summary and reset the summary approval process. 
Flower argued it was improper for the board to rescind their approval, as they had not violated the Michigan Open Meetings Act. 

“The Open Meetings Act allows for the opportunity for the public to review the deliberations for the form on the record. Those deliberations were fulsome and spirited, and everyone commented on the actual form of the petition that was before the board, then is still before the board now,” Flower said.

Although the board was initially scheduled to consider the form of the proposed constitutional amendment, the matter was removed from the agenda in light of the board’s vote. 
Thursday’s meeting also marked the consideration of two ballot initiatives aimed at requiring voters to verify their citizenship in order to cast their ballot, with both proposals submitted by the same organization, Americans for Citizen Voting. 
While the board approved the summary language for the group’s initial petition at their meeting in May, the form was not, due to a few typos in the proposed language for the constitutional amendment.
Alongside considering the form for the first effort, the board considered the language and form for the group’s second proposed amendment.
Canvasser Heather Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions on why the ballot committee would file a second initiative with the same goals as the first, after the group’s attorney, David Porter, explained they would not be withdrawing the first effort. 
“We took a lot of the comments that were made at the last meeting and discussion by the board to heart. Some of those changes are reflected in this new proposal. So it just offers a different alternative, in case we would like to proceed with that,” Porter said. 
Paul Jacob, the group’s chair, explained that the group had not yet decided which proposal it planned to circulate among voters for placement on the ballot. 
“We’re unlikely to do two. We’re very likely to do one,” Jacob said, noting that they would likely proceed with the second proposal.
By law, the group can propose and file as many measures as it would like, Jacob said, assuring Cummings “two is as many as we would like.”
However, Mark Brewer, a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party and the attorney for Promote the Vote Action, which opposes the proposal and the other effort requiring voters to verify their citizenship, called the move bad form. 
“I’ve been practicing before this board since the 1980s… I have never seen anybody and I would not advise my clients to do what is being done here today. I just think it’s poor practice and doesn’t serve democracy to hide the ball in terms of what proposal a group’s going to circulate,” Brewer said.
While the board approved the form of the first petition and the summary language and form for the second petition, Board Chair Richard Houskamp, a Republican, chastised the group for submitting multiple petitions seeking the same end, telling members of the ballot committee they were setting a dangerous precedent.

When asked whether they would consider withdrawing one of their proposals, Jacob declined, though Americans for Citizen Voting – Michigan Treasurer Kurt O’Keefe told Houskamp “it’s highly likely that your concern will be met in a way that you find appropriate.”
Following the meeting, Jacob spoke with reporters, explaining that the group’s second proposal was filed out of concern that the first proposal “could get blocked at any point,” and that they did not want to place their  trust in the first proposal receiving approval. 
“Today, people working on this campaign are going to get together and decide which measure should we go with. I think it’s pretty likely it’ll be this second one that was just approved,” he said.
The two proposals mark the second and third effort approved by the board in recent months aimed at preventing noncitizens from voting in Michigan elections. The first, approved in April, was launched in support of an effort introduced by House Majority Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) in the Legislature, which would require Michigan residents to show proof of citizenship when casting their ballot and registering to vote.
Jacob said his group had been in contact with the organization in charge of the other initiative, the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, and while their proposals are close, he considers their most recent proposal to be the best effort. 
Unlike the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights proposal, Jacob said their proposal offers more clarity on what it would require from the Secretary of State, as well as the rules and penalties for violating the law. It also does not require any action from the Legislature, Jacob said, whereas the other group’s proposal would have the Legislature craft a program to ensure citizens facing hardship have the documents needed to cast their ballot. 
In order to make the ballot in 2026, the groups will need to gather nearly 446,198 signatures within 180 days and file them with the Secretary of State, with Jacob telling reporters they expect to launch their effort before the end of the month. 
 He also doesn’t expect to see two competing petition drives. 
“There’s no fight here. There’s people who want to see only citizens voting, making sure that our elections are secure, and we’re going to all be working together,” he said.

While noncitizens are barred from voting in federal elections, conservatives in Michigan have raised alarms over election security after a Chinese citizen attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor cast a ballot in the 2024 general election. However, a review from the Michigan Department of State released in April confirmed instances of noncitizen voting are extremely rare, with only 15 credible cases identified out of the more than 5.7 millions ballots cast in the state in the general election last year.
Micheal Davis, the executive director of Promote the Vote, called Americans for Citizen Voting’s efforts “yet another initiative that aims to make it more difficult for all eligible voters to cast a ballot,” but applauded the board of canvassers changes to the petition summary, highlighting negative impacts the proposal would have on voters. 
“Michigan’s elections are secure and accurate, and we should be looking for ways to build on that progress, not trying to bury citizens in unnecessary red tape. We urge Michiganders to visit noredtapeformi.com and decline to sign the petitions for these harmful initiatives,” Davis said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3969-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
Rent is eating up a greater share of tenants’ income in almost every state

“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”










If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate. That’s almost a given here.


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger


The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Elsewhere

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
South Carolina’s bipartisan bill was introduced in late March and received no action before the session ended in May, other than legislators adding their names as a co-sponsor. It could be taken up next year, however. The chief sponsor is a Republican from fast-growing Horry County. There are 10 co-sponsors: five Republicans and five Democrats.










I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta


This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)Four more former Southern Regional Jail correctional officers were sentenced to prison this week for their roles in the death of an inmate in 2022. 
Quantez Burks, identified in Justice Department news releases by his initials, died March 1, 2022, reportedly one day after being booked in the Raleigh County, West Virginia jail on charges of wanton endangerment and obstructing an officer. Officers in the case have been convicted of taking Burks to an area of the prison without cameras and assaulting him in retaliation for attempting to leave his assigned pod.
Mark Holdren, 41, of Beckley, was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters, 33, of Rainelle, got 21 years — each for conspiring with other officers to violate the man’s civil rights, resulting in his death. They were sentenced to three years of supervised release after prison. 
In addition, a judge on Thursday sentenced Corey Snyder, 30, to 19 years and seven months for conspiring with other officers to violate Burks’ civil rights by using unreasonable force. 
Jacob Boothe, 27, got three years in prison for failing to intervene to stop fellow officers from assaulting Burks.
According to the Department of Justice, Snyder, Holdren and other officers brought Burks to an interview room where Walters joined them. There, they struck and kicked him, pulled and twisted his fingers and used pepper spray while the man was restrained and handcuffed. Boothe was present during the assault and did not try to stop it, the Justice department said. 
Walters and other officers also carried Burks by his arms and legs and then swung his head into a metal door to open it, the release says, and then dropped him onto a concrete floor. Emergency personnel declared him dead not long after. 
Altogether, six former officers have been indicted in the assault. Former officer Ashley Toney pleaded guilty last year to failing to intervene to protect Burks from the officers’ assault and was sentenced to six years and six months in prison. A jury found Chad Lester, a former lieutenant, guilty on three obstruction of justice charges for his role in conspiring to cover up the death. He was sentenced to 17 years and six months in prison on May 15, 2025.
Two other former officers — Steven Nicholas Wimmer and Andrew Fleshman — pleaded guilty before the indictment to conspiring to use unreasonable force against Burks. Wimmer, 26, of Bluefield, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Fleshman is set to be sentenced Monday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-10 20:30:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Hospitals see risks in big federal tax law that shrinks Medicaid spending,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/10/big-tax-law-shrinks-medicaid-spending/,The Mississippi Hospital Association says a big new federal law could cause deeper financial problems for some hospitals in one of the poorest states in the nation.,"Mississippi hospitals could lose up to $1 billion over the next decade under the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax and policy bill President Donald Trump signed into law last week, according to leaders at the Mississippi Hospital Association.
The leaders say the cuts could force some already-struggling rural hospitals to reduce services or close their doors.
The law includes the largest reduction in federal health and social safety net programs in history. It passed 218-214, with all Democrats voting against the measure and all but five Republicans voting for it. 
In the short term, these cuts will make health care less accessible to poor Mississippians by making the eligibility requirements for Medicaid insurance stiffer, likely increasing people’s medical debt. 
In the long run, the cuts could lead to worsening chronic health conditions such as diabetes and obesity for which Mississippi already leads the nation, and making private insurance more expensive for many people, experts say. 
“We’ve got about a billion dollars that are potentially hanging in the balance over the next 10 years,” Mississippi Hospital Association President Richard Roberson said Wednesday during a panel discussion at his organization’s headquarters.

“If folks were being honest, the entire system depends on those rural hospitals,” he said.
Mississippi’s uninsured population could increase by 160,000 people as a combined result of the new law and the expiration of Biden-era enhanced subsidies that made marketplace insurance affordable – and which Trump is not expected to renew – according to KFF, a health policy research group. 
That could make things even worse for those who are left on the marketplace plans. 
“Younger, healthier people are going to leave the risk pool, and that’s going to mean it’s more expensive to insure the patients that remain,” said Lucy Dagneau, senior director of state and local campaigns at the American Cancer Society. 
Among the biggest changes facing Medicaid-eligible patients are stiffer eligibility requirements, including proof of work. The new law requires able-bodied adults ages 19 to 64 to work, do community service or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to qualify for, or keep, Medicaid coverage and federal food aid. 
Opponents say qualified recipients could be stripped of benefits if they lose a job or fail to complete paperwork attesting to their time commitment.
Georgia became the case study for work requirements with a program called Pathways to Coverage, which was touted as a conservative alternative to Medicaid expansion. 
Ironically, the 54-year-old mechanic chosen by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to be the face of the program got so fed up with the work requirements he went from praising the program on television to saying “I’m done with it” after his benefits were allegedly cancelled twice due to red tape. 
Roberson sent several letters to Mississippi’s congressional members in weeks leading up to the final vote on the sweeping federal legislation, sounding the alarm on what it would mean for hospitals and patients.
Among Roberson’s chief concerns is a change in the mechanism called state directed payments, which allows states to beef up Medicaid reimbursement rates – typically the lowest among insurance payors. The new law will reduce those enhanced rates to nearly as low as the Medicare rate, costing the state at least $500 million and putting rural hospitals in a bind, Roberson told Mississippi Today. 
That change will happen over 10 years starting in 2028. That, in conjunction with the new law’s  one-time payment program called the Rural Health Care Fund, means if the next few years look normal, it doesn’t mean Mississippi is safe, stakeholders warn. 
“We’re going to have a sort of deceiving situation in Mississippi where we look a little flush with cash with the rural fund and the state directed payments in 2027 and 2028, and then all of a sudden our state directed payments start going down and that fund ends and then we’re going to start dipping,” said Leah Rupp Smith, vice president for policy and advocacy at the Mississippi Hospital Association.

Even with that buffer time, immediate changes are on the horizon for health care in Mississippi because of fear and uncertainty around ever-changing rules. 
“Hospitals can’t budget when we have these one-off programs that start and stop and the rules change – and there’s a cost to administering a program like this,” Smith said.
Since hospitals are major employers – and they also provide a sense of safety for incoming businesses –  their closure, especially in rural areas, affects not just patients but local economies and communities. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is the only Democrat in Mississippi’s congressional delegation. He voted against the bill, while the state’s two Republican senators and three Republican House members voted for it. Thompson said in a statement that the new law does not bode well for the Delta, one of the poorest regions in the U.S. 
“For my district, this means closed hospitals, nursing homes, families struggling to afford groceries, and educational opportunities deferred,” Thompson said. “Republicans’ priorities are very simple: tax cuts for (the) wealthy and nothing for the people who make this country work.”
While still colloquially referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the name was changed by Democrats invoking a maneuver that has been used by lawmakers in both chambers to oppose a bill on principle. 
“Democrats are forcing Republicans to delete their farcical bill name,” Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement. “Nothing about this bill is beautiful — it’s a betrayal to American families and it’s undeserving of such a stupid name.”
The law is expected to add at least $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next 10 years, according to the most recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09170138/Big-Beautiful-Bill-Effect-on-Ms-Health-Care-8.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

“I just recommend people to stay calm. We're not expecting any high end impacts,” one meteorologist said.

Slow-moving showers and scattered thunderstorms that began Thursday morning are expected to continue throughout the afternoon and evening, which could lead to flooding in low lying areas in the state. 
Some parts of the state may see no precipitation while other areas may see 1 to 3 inches of rain or more, said Matthew Clay, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Burlington office.
The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm and flooding warnings for Vermont, and meteorologists expect up to 60 miles per hour wind and quarter-sized hail, particularly in the northwestern portion of the state and Lamoille County. 
Clay said the weather conditions could bring localized lightning, torrential rain, and “some gusty to damaging winds.”
“All the thunderstorms today are going to be capable of producing very heavy rain and frequent cloud-to-ground lightning,” Clay said. 
The storm is forecast to move eastward across the state Thursday afternoon and evening, with the most severe conditions expected to hit between 3 and 8 p.m., he said. 
While watching for flash flooding, Clay said the weather service has only observed standing water flood conditions in areas in the state, which are flood conditions that are slower developing and less life-threatening. 
National Weather Service Meteorologist Seth Kutikoff said the weather event predicted is not a cause for high alarm as it is a “typical type of thunderstorm that we get at least a few times a year.” Hot conditions are expected to follow in the coming week, he said.
He also recommended that people in Vermont remain near shelter areas throughout Thursday and stay aware of rain and wind conditions.
“I just recommend people to stay calm,” Kutikoff said. “We’re not expecting any high end impacts.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal district court judge in New Hampshire said Thursday he will issue an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and will hold that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t now have injunctions, but it will be stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled, “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid.
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the forthcoming ruling in a press conference after the hearing.
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s ruling came weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class actions — national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held.
New precedent
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action designation to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action within days of the Casa decision in June.
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities.
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants.
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said.
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there.
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order.
In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

(NPS/Jacob W. Frank)Fresh off of a year that saw Yellowstone and Glacier national parks notch their second-highest visitation years ever, the two anchors for Montana’s tourism sector are on an even hotter pace this summer, which could see new all-time records. 
Officials with Yellowstone National Park announced this week that the park hosted 928,250 visitors in June, up 14,000 from the previous year.
While that number is roughly 1% lower than during the park’s 2021 record-setting season, year-to-date data shows the nation’s oldest national park is on track for a historic year. 
So far in 2025, Yellowstone has seen 1,690,922 recreation visits — up 4% from 2024 and up 6% over the same time period in 2021. 
Up in northwest Montana, Glacier National Park notched record visitation for May, the most recent month data is available, with 238,766 recreation visitors passing through the entrance stations. 
Bolstered by more than 30,000 additional visitors in May compared to the next highest year, Glacier has welcomed 346,437 visitors so far this year — 12% more than the same period last year and a whopping 31% more than in 2017, the park’s record year. 
During its banner year in 2017, Glacier saw more than 1 million visitors in July and more than 900,000 in August. Last year, the park set records for late-season visitation in September and October due to changes to the pilot vehicle reservation system Glacier officials instigated in 2021 to moderate the impacts of increased tourists. 
New changes to the park’s reservation system for this year include timed enty’s on the park’s western entrances. 
The record tourist visits to Montana’s national parks come as the National Park Service is at historically low levels of staffing. 
A recent report by the National Parks Conservation Association indicates the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent workforce since January, with 4,000 staff members leaving the agency through “terminations, pressured buyouts, deferred resignations and early retirement buyouts.”
“This has left parks severely understaffed during peak visitation, putting visitor centers, trail maintenance and public safety at risk when help is needed most,” the report states.
In response to questions earlier this year from the Daily Montanan about staffing levels at Glacier and Yellowstone, the National Park Service Office of Public Affairs issued a generic statement. 
“The National Park Service is hiring seasonal workers to continue enhancing the visitor experience as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management. We are focused on ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks,” the statement said. “NPS is working closely with the Office of Personnel Management to ensure we are prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people. As always, NPS will continue to provide critical services and deliver excellent customer service.”
An internal memo from Glacier obtained by the Daily Montanan showed that in early May, more than 20% of park positions were vacant, including almost half of dispatch positions. 
“Dispatch is down to 60% staffing, so expect 60% service,” the memo stated. 
The Daily Montanan has confirmed a number of Glacier Park employees who have left their positions since May, including former public information officer Gina Icenoggle, who told reporters in May that her position would likely not be filled, and instead be folded into the Department of the Interior, leaving no local public information personnel in place.  
 Trump issues EO on foreign visitor surcharge

On July 3, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Interior to increase entry fees at national park service sites for foreign tourists, “improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures.”
The idea, long championed by Bozeman-based “free-market environmentalism” nonprofit think tank Property and Environment Research Center could rake in tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue for national parks facing maintenance backlogs and budget cuts.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/27812931390_9e7f9f596a_k-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

Laura Kelly sent GOP governor candidate Jeff Colyer a letter Thursday denouncing Colyer's use of a devastating May tornado to seek donations for his campaign. This July 9 image is of damage to Grinnell, which was pummeled by a tornado. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly objected to Republican governor candidate Jeff Colyer’s fundraising appeals tied to a devastating tornado that tore through Pratt, Stafford and Reno counties in May.
In a letter obtained by Kansas Reflector, Kelly criticized Colyer for issuing two fundraising messages in June that alleged Kelly’s response to the storm fell short of expectations after an EF3 tornado barreled into the communities of Grinnell and Plevna. Damage to buildings and equipment was substantial, but no one was killed.
“You should know better than to use an emergency disaster response for patently political purposes,” Kelly said in the letter to Colyer. “Beyond tacky and crass.”
She said it was wrong to manipulate damaged Kansas communities for campaign photo opportunities or to package such heartbreaking events to attack a political rival.
“Just to set the record straight, Jeff, my emergency management team was in communication and on the ground with local responders immediately,” Kelly’s letter said. “And, as soon as my presence would be helpful, and not get in the way of recovery efforts, I was there.”
Colyer’s requests for campaign donations of $25, $50 or $100 were laced with claims Kelly was slow to seek disaster assistance. He said he was building a “movement to put Kansas first, to ensure no community is left behind and to deliver the kind of leadership that doesn’t flinch in a crisis.”
Colyer, who served nearly a year as governor following the resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback, said he would have immediately deployed the Kansas National Guard and promptly ordered removal of storm debris after the May 18-19 storm.
He said he would have requested the presidential disaster declaration before Kelly did on June 17.
“This is a moment for leadership and compassion,” Colyer’s campaign messages said. “Our neighbors are hurting. I’ve walked their shattered fields and seen the wreckage of a lifetime.”
Colyer asserted — falsely, the governor’s office said — that neither Kelly nor administration officials visited the damage zone before June 3. Colyer published images of him touring storm damage with a half-dozen state legislators.
In a news release published June 18, Kelly said the Kansas Division of Emergency Management began coordination of the storm response with local officials on May 18.
The Kansas Department of Transportation mobilized the night of the tornado to close Interstate 70 and clear debris and downed powerlines, the governor said. KDOT organized traffic control for interstate lane reductions until new power poles were installed by May 21.
Officials with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued a disposal-without-a-permit to Grinnell on May 20 for on-site burial of disaster debris. KDHE issued a fee waiver to Plevna for the Reno County landfill.
On May 21, KDHE suspended fees for obtaining certified copies of birth and marriage certificates for Gove County residents through July 18.
The governor said she visited Grinnell on May 22, secured U.S. Small Business Administration low-interest loans for nine counties on May 31, issued a state disaster emergency proclamation for 11 counties on June 4, initiated the process of documenting damage for the Federal Emergency Management Agency on June 5 and submitted the major presidential disaster declaration on June 17.
“You owe the people of Grinnell and Plevna an apology,” Kelly’s letter to Colyer said. “Next time, before you make a fool of yourself, call me. I’ll be glad to give you the facts.”

A midsummer federal education funding freeze has iced more than $33 million earmarked for Idaho — creating a climate of uncertainty.
The Boise School District is hoping to avoid staff cuts. A Democratic legislator — and Boise school teacher — is particularly worried about a program for students who are trying to learn English. State superintendent Debbie Critchfield has freed up $2.8 million to fill part of the gap.
But Critchfield, a Republican, is largely staying out of the fray. She declined an interview request, and in a statement, she said she is hoping the funding will ultimately find its way to the states. “We’re hopeful we will know the timeline for distribution sooner rather than later as decisions are being made now in local districts for the coming school year.”
Technically speaking, the White House hasn’t cut the funding, which Congress has already authorized. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education withheld the July 1 payments, while it reviews a host of federal grant programs.
In a terse June 30 email to Critchfield’s office, shared with Idaho EdNews, the federal Education Department said it “remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
This puts $33.3 million of Idaho’s federal funding on hold, Critchfield’s office says. Here’s how that breaks down:
“Supporting effective instruction:” $10.8 million. A federal grant program — known officially as Title II-A — provides states and local schools funding for professional development.
Migrant education: $7.1 million. The feds’ Title I-C program is designed to provide extra help for students who frequently move from school to school.
Student support and academic enrichment: $6.7 million. Known as Title IV-A, these grants can be used for anything from digital literacy and new course offerings to bullying prevention and suicide prevention.
Before- and after-school programs: $6.5 million. The Title IV-B grants finance “21st Century Community Learning Centers” that operate outside the normal school day.
English language programs: $2.1 million. The feds’ Title III grants “provide equal learning opportunities for multilingual learners,” according to an Idaho Department of Education web page on the program.
All told, a $33 million freeze could affect 16.5% of Idaho’s federal education funding, according to the Learning Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. Only four states and the District of Columbia face deeper funding cuts.
Critchfield threw a lifeline to some local schools, as James Dawson of Boise State Public Radio first reported Wednesday. The state Education Department said it would free up $2.8 million, holdover money from previous budget years, to fund after-school programs through at least December.
“Our goal is to reduce uncertainty and help programs retain experienced staff who are essential to continued operations,” Sheena Strickler, the department’s 21st Century Community Learning Centers coordinator, said in a Wednesday email to grant recipients.
For some districts, the freeze still could have a profound impact on the bottom line. In Nampa, for example, $1.7 million is on the line. “(We’re) staying in close contact with the State Department of Education and remain hopeful for more clarity and a timely resolution,” district spokesman Matt Sizemore told Dawson.
Boise school Superintendent Lisa Roberts
In Boise, $1.5 million is in jeopardy.
“Without this funding, we would face difficult decisions that could affect student supports and services,” Superintendent Lisa Roberts said Wednesday, in an email to staff and parents. “We are committed to working thoughtfully to avoid staffing reductions and minimize any disruption to our students and schools.”
But schools have little time and few options, said Rep. Soñia Galaviz, a Boise Democrat who sits on the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. In Boise, Galaviz and her fellow teachers will be returning to work in early August. Unless schools dip into their budget reserves to make up for lost federal dollars — a risky move in and of itself — they might not have any other way to keep staff on the payroll.
“There’s no safety net,” she said Wednesday. “There’s no secret bank account.”
Galaviz teaches at Boise’s Whittier Elementary School, where nearly 24% of students have limited English proficiency. She is particularly concerned about a potential cut in English language programs — especially after President Donald Trump has issued an executive order declaring English the nation’s official language, and after the 2025 Legislature approved a constitutional amendment, subject to voter approval, to make English the state’s official language. Cutting off support for students trying to learn English would be “an enormous loss,” Galaviz said.
Rep. Wendy Horman, JFAC’s House co-chair, said she wanted more details about how schools spend the federal dollars. Until then, she’s reluctant to say whether any of these programs are critical to K-12.
“I can see big buckets of money,” said Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican. “But what I can’t see and don’t know is how those monies are used at the local level.”
Horman also noted that federal funding is a moving target. She pointed to a $59 million University of Idaho ag research grant. In April, the feds yanked the grant, the largest in U of I history. But the U of I was allowed to reapply for the money, and did so last month.
“I think we have more questions than answers at this time,” Horman said.
Critchfield has directed many of her questions at Idaho’s congressional delegation — asking if they have any information about when the feds might free up money.
Meanwhile, she says, local schools might be forced to pick up the slack.
“We’ve encouraged local districts and charters to review any carryover funding that may help support the programs in question,” she said in a statement.

• permanent repair of disaster-damaged facilities and public infrastructure for Chaves, Lincoln, Otero and Valencia counties
The governor’s office also noted the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management is actively working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct preliminary damage assessments.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) who also visited Ruidoso for a news conference Thursday morning noted in a news release the state’s entire congressional delegation had urged President Donald Trump to sign the emergency declaration.
“The impacts of this historic flood require federal resources for adequate recovery and ongoing mitigation efforts, there’s no other way around it,” Vasquez said in a statwment. “Working with local, state, and federal officials, we successfully unlocked crucial disaster funding to address the immediate needs of recovery operations.”

Free.,US Senate Dems from Western states blast Trump budget for cutting federal aid,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-western-states-blast-trump-budget-cutting-federal-aid,,"Members of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee differed along party lines at a Thursday hearing about how the U.S. Forest Service should partner with states and how the federal wildfire response should be organized.Senators of both parties emphasized the importance of working  with state forest managers. But while Republicans praised the efforts of Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, a former state forest administrator in Idaho and Montana, to reach out to state governments, Democrats noted that President Donald Trump’s budget request for fiscal 2026 proposed eliminating a key program for state and tribal partnerships.Democrats on the panel also raised a series of questions about the still-unfinished Forest Service budget request as the next fiscal year approaches in less than three months.Schultz told the senators the budget proposal was not yet final, but confirmed the agency was telling states to prepare for zero dollars in discretionary spending for the State, Private, and Tribal Forestry program in fiscal 2026.The program received more than $300 million in discretionary funding in fiscal 2024, plus another roughly $300 million in supplemental funding.The Trump budget request does include $300 million for supplemental funds to the program that can be used for disaster relief.Impact of ‘big, beautiful’ lawRanking Democrat Martin Heinrich of New Mexico noted states are facing tighter budgets after passage of Republicans’ “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation law that includes a host of policy tweaks meant to reduce federal safety net spending while extending tax cuts for high earners.Under the law, states will be required to pay billions more per year to cover a greater share of major federal-state partnership programs for food assistance and health coverage.“States need that funding,” Heinrich said of the forestry program. “That is an example of a successful partnership. If we don’t have that funding, that’s not shared responsibility, that’s abdicating our federal responsibility… at a time when (state) budgets are being decimated by Medicaid cuts thanks to the big, whatever bill.”Schultz said the state foresters had relayed similar concerns, which the administration was considering as it finalized the budget request.Chairman Mike Lee of Utah said the Forest Service under Schultz had given states greater flexibility to set their own forest management policies.“I want to thank you, Chief, for giving the states more and more authority, more involvement and more of an ability to set a course for the proper management of these lands,” he said. “I know that Utah is really looking forward to working with you to expand these partnerships and I know my state is not alone in that.”Funding versus dialogueDemocratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California also blasted the administration for cutting the state forestry spending.“Every state that I’m aware of is having a tougher budget picture to face,” he told Schultz. “The threat of fires is real. The threat of fires is growing. How does it make sense for the federal government to zero out these programs?”Schultz answered that the agency would continue “partnering with the states in dialogue and discussion.”“But you’re zeroing out their resources,” Padilla said.“That’s correct,” Schultz said. “It’s sharing that responsibility and pushing it to the states.”Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper, a former governor and Denver mayor, said the Trump budget request more broadly called for shifting more funding responsibilities to state and local governments.“I see again and again, throughout all the budgets we're seeing, is more costs shifted from the federal government to states and local areas that are going through their own budget struggles right now,” he said.Montana Republican Steve Daines defended the idea of greater state responsibility, saying he had found the Gem State’s approach to land management more effective than the federal government’s.“If you take a look at the landscapes across Montana and look at federal lands versus state lands, I can tell you the state's doing a much, much better job in terms of stewardship of public lands than the federal government,” Daines said.New firefighting serviceSchultz said several times the administration had not yet finalized a plan to shift federal firefighting authorities to the Interior Department. The responsibility is currently split between the Forest Service, which is under the Department of Agriculture, and various Interior agencies, primarily the Bureau of Land Management.Heinrich, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, raised concerns about the lack of a plan.Heinrich said he was open-minded about the reorganization effort but was concerned that Congress had not yet seen a blueprint.“I think there are many of us who are more concerned about the adequacy of that plan and would like to see that plan before we start making budgetary decisions about whether it's a good idea or not,” he said. “I am very open to different ways of organizing how we fight fires on our national forests and our public lands. But I want to see the plan.”Wyden raised opposition to the idea more broadly, saying the Forest Service should remain involved in firefighting.“Nobody in my home state… has told me, in effect, ‘Ron we gotta have the Forest Service less involved in fighting fires,’” Wyden said. “But that is the net effect of your organizational plan.”Schultz said the proposed reorganization would not cut any federal firefighting resources, but move the federal agency responsible for overseeing the issue. The administration would not put the reorganization in place this fire season, he added.",,,,2025-07-10 16:14:38.370192

The Delaware State Police announced the promotion of Captain J. Andrew Lloyd to the rank of Major, which went into effect on June 27, 2025. Major Lloyd now serves as the New Castle County Operations Officer, bringing over two decades of law enforcement experience to his new leadership role.
“This will continue to strengthen the Delaware State Police,” said Colonel William D. Crotty, Superintendent of the Delaware State Police. 
Major Lloyd began his career as a patrol trooper at Troops 6 and 7 and was later promoted to Sergeant at Troop 9. He went on to supervise the Criminal Investigations Unit at Troop 2, overseeing both the Drug Unit and the Property Crimes Unit. His work included a high-profile joint investigation with the New Castle County Police Department, Wilmington Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. That investigation led to the disruption of one of Delaware’s largest heroin distribution networks.
He also led investigations into firearms and racketeering crimes, collaborated with federal partners, and was recognized as an expert in Superior Court.
In 2019, Lloyd became a Lieutenant at Troop 9, where he led 35 sworn troopers and civilian staff while working closely with government agencies and civic groups. That same year, he received international recognition with the 2019 IACP 40 Under 40 award, honoring him as one of the world’s top law enforcement leaders under the age of 40.

From 2021 to 2024, Lloyd served as Director of the State Bureau of Identification. During his tenure, he modernized background checks, enhanced fingerprint digitization, negotiated key contracts, and strengthened Delaware’s participation in the National Fingerprint File. He also led the division’s largest civilian workforce and supported public security legislation.
Most recently, Lloyd commanded nearly 100 troopers and civilian staff as the Commander of Troop 3. Under his leadership, the troop expanded its proactive enforcement efforts and enhanced community partnerships to support crime-reduction initiatives. He also managed the Delaware State Police’s operational response to major events, including NASCAR and the Phish Festival, and oversaw the implementation of a high-risk violent offender program.
Lloyd holds both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from Wilmington University, with a graduate specialization in Homeland Security. He is also a graduate of the FBI National Academy Session 289.
Beyond his law enforcement duties, Major Lloyd has volunteered for over a decade as a youth basketball, softball, and Little League coach. He continues to support Special Olympics Delaware and has served on several DSP committees, including as Chair of the Wellness Committee and Co-Chair of the Events Committee for the agency’s 100th Anniversary Planning Committee.
The Delaware State Police congratulated Major Lloyd on the promotion in a statement: “Delaware State Police congratulates Andrew Lloyd for this well-deserved promotion.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Nebraska Examiner)President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

ChristianaCare and Delaware County leaders marked a major milestone in the construction of ChristianaCare Hospital, Aston, on July 9 with a ceremonial beam-signing to commemorate the completion of the structural phase of the project.
Located at 700 N. Turner Way, the 20,000-square-foot hospital remains on track to open in the second half of 2026. ChristianaCare is developing the facility in partnership with Emerus Holdings, Inc., the nation’s leading developer of neighborhood hospitals.
“This is an exciting moment, not just for ChristianaCare, but for the Aston community,” said Pauline Corso, president of Ambulatory Network Continuity and Growth at ChristianaCare. 
“We’re building more than just a hospital. We’re building relationships, trust and access to much-needed care where people live. It’s been incredible to see this hospital take shape, and we can’t wait to welcome our neighbors through the doors.”

“Signing this commemorative beam is a proud and meaningful milestone,” he said. “This hospital will bring vital, high-quality care to the people of Aston Township — close to home and when they need it most,” said Jim Bennett, MHA, BSN, FACHE, market CEO for ChristianaCare-Emerus. “From emergency services to specialty care in a modern, welcoming environment, it’s thoughtfully designed to meet the everyday health needs of this community. We’re excited for what’s ahead and honored to be part of this next chapter in care.”
Unlike standalone emergency departments or urgent care centers, ChristianaCare Hospital, Aston will be a fully licensed, small-format hospital open 24/7. It will include a full-service emergency department capable of treating common emergencies such as falls, injuries, heart attacks and strokes. Additional services will include a 10-bed inpatient unit, diagnostic imaging (CT, X-ray, ultrasound), laboratory services, and access to virtual consultations with specialists in fields such as cardiology and neurology.

Jim Pillen on Tuesday announced the appointments of all but one member to Nebraska’s new School Financing Review Commission to review and provide annual recommendations to stabilize state aid to schools and reduce reliance on local property taxes.
State lawmakers created the 18-member commission, chaired by Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, in a 48-0 vote this spring. It took effect June 5 and required initial appointments within 30 days. 
The group’s main task is reviewing the main school funding formula — the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act (TEEOSA) — and providing periodic suggestions so the Legislature can update it.

There remains one vacancy for a certified public school teacher.
Pillen on Tuesday called the commission “a first but critically important step” in fixing a “35-year problem” since TEEOSA was established in 1990. The formula survived a veto and public referendum after its creation and has been perpetually updated since.
“I believe the state needs to fulfill its constitutional obligation to fund public K-12 education. Not run those schools but fund them,” Pillen said Tuesday. “If we are to get a grip on the state’s property tax crisis, we must be willing to address the ever-growing burden that falls on property tax as a result of footing the bill for our schools.”
TEEOSA components
In its most basic terms, TEEOSA diverts “equalization aid” to the public school districts it calculates have more “needs” than available “resources.”
“Needs” is calculated among 18 buckets, including a district’s concentrations of poverty, students with limited English proficiency, transportation needs and student growth. 
  These are the various components that make up the “resources” and “needs” that amount of “equalization aid” as part of the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act (TEEOSA). (Courtesy of the Nebraska Department of Education)
“Resources” includes six buckets of funds, including estimates of property taxes that could be raised with a $1 tax levy and net option enrollment funds.
The formula diverts about $1.2 billion among 245 school districts each year. An increasing number of districts do not receive any TEEOSA aid under the formula, which is why Pillen and other senators in 2023 created a new form of “foundation aid,” which distributes roughly $1,500 to school districts for each student served. About 60% of foundation aid is now considered a “resource” under TEEOSA.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, led the creation of the commission after past legislative attempts to do so fell short. Hughes ultimately secured a spot on the commission herself and has pledged to continue working to address school finance.
The commission membership was specifically designed to include education representatives from school districts of all sizes, postsecondary education and taxpayers.

Property tax focus
Three former senators also joined the commission, notably former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area and State Treasurer Tom Briese, a former state senator from Albion. Both were instrumental in establishing “foundation aid” with Pillen and shifting the property tax portion of community college funding — nearly $300 million — onto state income and sales taxes in 2023.
Those changes helped reduce property taxes statewide by $6 million out of a $5.3 billion statewide total when property taxes were sent to Nebraskans in December 2024, the first reduction in property taxes paid in 26 years. 
In 2022 and 2023, property taxes had grown by nearly $300 million annually. And with property tax relief legislation stalling this spring, Pillen has estimated that taxpayers will see tax increases when tax bills go out this year.
Linehan, a former Revenue Committee chair of six years and a key ally of Pillen’s, proposed her own legislation to amend TEEOSA, largely focused on the “resources” side of the equation.

Briese, too, has continued to echo calls to have the state take on more school operational expenses, similar to what happened with community colleges in the 2023 bill led by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the Education Committee chair, who will also serve on the new commission.
TEEOSA had been eyed as the main vehicle to distribute more state aid to the state’s 245 school districts for operational expenses in lieu of property taxes.
The other former state senator named to the commission is Fred Meyer of St. Paul whom Pillen appointed to succeed Briese in the Legislature in late 2023, when Briese became treasurer.
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln rounds out the current legislative members with Murman and Hughes, each of whom will serve as nonvoting commissioners.
Hughes said in a text that she is “thrilled” about the commission membership and her own legislative appointment. She said she is ready to “get going and dive in.”
“I think the makeup of the committee is good, and there’s a lot of knowledge about TEEOSA, so we should be able to hit the ground running,” Hughes said.
‘Something of substance’

Maher previously told the Nebraska Examiner it would be an “honor” to chair the commission. He said a lot of time has already gone into thinking how the first meeting would be structured to bring people together “to not just meet, but to have something of substance done that we can give to the Legislature for their consideration.”
The commission has no expiration date. Some lawmakers have referred to TEEOSA as being on “autopilot,” Maher said, and while he might not “exactly agree,” he said it “might be pretty close.”
Maher, a former superintendent of Kearney Public Schools and Centennial Public Schools, said it’s probably time to rethink what school funding should look like generally in the state and not just tweak TEEOSA.
“I think if we can get about that answer and not worrying about TEEOSA,” Maher said, “I think maybe we can either say we’ve got the best model out there already, or here’s a new model for consideration.”

If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York, and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)In another major legal win in the fight against the opioid crisis, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Thursday that the commonwealth could receive up to $16.4 million as part of a sweeping $720 million multi-state settlement with eight generic drug manufacturers accused of flooding communities with addictive painkillers.
“Years ago, pharmaceutical companies exploited Virginians, treating them like test subjects while pushing dangerous, addictive drugs into our communities while lining their pockets,” Miyares said in a statement. 
“Though no settlement can erase the heartbreak and lives lost to the opioid crisis, I’m proud of my office for fighting to secure over $16 million to help Virginians heal, support recovery, and hold these companies accountable for the devastation they profited from.”
The settlement includes Mylan (now part of Viatris), Hikma, Amneal, Apotex, Indivior, Sun, Alvogen, and Zydus — companies that will pay a combined total of $720 million over various timeframes. 
Mylan will contribute the largest share, paying more than $284 million over nine years. Other payments include $95 million from Hikma, $71 million from Amneal, and $63 million from Apotex. Alvogen, Zydus and Apotex will make one-time payments, while others will pay over several years.
Beyond the money, the agreement imposes new restrictions. Seven of the eight companies are now prohibited from marketing or promoting opioids, barred from producing pills containing more than 40 milligrams of oxycodone and required to implement systems to detect and report suspicious orders.
Indivior, known for its medications used in opioid addiction treatment, agreed to halt production and sales of opioid products for 10 years, though it can continue selling treatments for opioid use disorder.
Virginia helped negotiate the deal alongside attorneys general from California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.
The announcement marks another step in Virginia’s broader legal effort to hold opioid manufacturers accountable — efforts that have now resulted in over $1.1 billion in secured settlements for the state. 
Just last month, Miyares announced Virginia’s role in a separate, high-profile $7.4 billion national settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family that would dissolve the family’s ownership of the company and permanently bar them from marketing opioids in the United States.
Virginia stands to receive up to $103.8 million from the Purdue deal, with the majority of the funds arriving in the first three years. The money will be channeled into prevention, treatment, and long-term recovery programs through the state’s Opioid Abatement Authority.
“The Sacklers spent years fueling an epidemic that shattered families, wrecked communities, and cost hundreds of thousands of American lives,” Miyares said in announcing the Purdue deal. 
“Though no amount of money will ever bring back those we’ve lost or undo the incomprehensible level of harm caused, these settlement funds will be invested in treatment, prevention, and recovery efforts across Virginia, helping our communities heal and saving lives.”
The impact of the opioid crisis in Virginia has been especially severe. 
A 2021 analysis by Virginia Commonwealth University and the Virginia Department of Health found nearly 150,000 Virginians living with opioid use disorder. At least six Virginians died each day, on average, from opioid overdoses that year.
By 2022, fentanyl — a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin — was responsible for more than 1,900 deaths in Virginia, more than double the toll from a decade earlier. 
However, early signs of progress are emerging. Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a 44% drop in fentanyl-related deaths in Virginia in 2024, marking the second-largest such decline in the country.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In the wake of the June assassination of a top Minnesota lawmaker, Oklahoma’s legislative leaders from both parties want to know if security can be considered an officeholder expense. 
In their letter, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, asked the state’s Ethic’s Commission to to determine if Oklahoma elected officials can legally use campaign donations to cover the cost of security measures.
The Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to provide an advisory opinion, which they expect to publish ahead of their next meeting scheduled for Aug. 14. 
The opinion would relate to only officeholders, not candidates for political office. 
“The tragic assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman by shooting at her home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota last month has emphasized to me the need to evaluate what can be done to prevent such an awful event from occurring in Oklahoma,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to the Commission’s Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone. “I am exploring how we can find a way to help provide security measures in our members’ residences. I know this can be costly. I am also aware that not everyone has the personal resources to install these kind of measures.” 
Hortman, a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband were assassinated in their home in June. 
Authorities allege Vance Boelter, 57, posed as a police officer to gain entrance to their home. He shot and killed Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, authorities said. He’s also accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife that same night. 
Boelter was later arrested and faces state and federal charges. The U.S. Attorneys’ Office charged Boelter with two counts of murder, two counts of stalking and two weapons charges. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty. 
Investigators said he had a list of other potential targets, including Democratic elected officials. 
Hoffman was released from the hospital Monday. He and his wife are recovering. 
The assassinations have led to public officials across the U.S. feeling on edge and weighing the cost of public service. 
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation opened half a dozen investigations into threats against public officials in the state in 2024 and 2025. 
Hunter McKee, a spokesperson for the agency, said the Bureau investigates many potential threats to Oklahoma officials but not all reach the point of open investigations. Other law enforcement agencies also assist in these investigations, he said. 
The lawmakers’ letter also referenced the Federal Election Commission’s guidance, which allows certain reasonable security devices and services to be paid for with campaign funds to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
Bruce Boone said several states allow security measures for officeholders with different restrictions. Some states have dollar limits, some are approved on a case-by-case basis and some must meet certain criteria to ensure the expense isn’t for personal use. 
“Because of the concern of these threats, it would be nice to have a way to ensure that they have this security device if they feel like that’s something that’s needed,” she said. “I think that dollar limit is something that the Legislature was very interested in us pursuing … as well ensuring, what would happen at the end of their term or at the end of their time in office? What would happen with that equipment? I think we would have to flesh all that out in the advisory opinion.”
Adam Weintraub, vice chair of the Ethics Commission, said if security is an allowable expense, limits or regulations need to be in place. 
“There’s a real difference between somebody who’s putting an alarm on their house and making it part of the house, and somebody who’s adding to their gun collection,” he said. 
While an advisory would help to interpret and explain the rules, adding specific parameters would require a rule change, said Margaret Kerr, the Commission’s general counsel. Administrative rule changes would require legislative approval.

Delaware drivers will soon pay more at toll booths and the DMV as the state moves forward with new transportation funding measures set to take effect later this year.
Following the passage of House Bill 164 and a resolution signed by Secretary of Transportation Shanté Hastings, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) announced toll and fee increases that are expected to generate an additional $107 million annually for infrastructure improvements across the state.
Toll increases begin August 15
Starting Friday, August 15, tolls on Delaware’s three major toll roads — I-95 in Newark, US 301, and State Route 1 — will rise for most drivers:

I-95 (Newark): Two-axle vehicles will see tolls increase from $4.00 to $5.00, for both cash and E-ZPass users.
US 301 (Mainline): E-ZPass tolls will increase from $4.00 to $5.00. Drivers using the toll-by-plate system will pay $7.00, up from $5.60.
SR 1 (Biddles Corner and Dover):

Delaware E-ZPass holders will pay $1.50 on weekdays and $4.00 on weekends.
Non-Delaware E-ZPass and cash users will be charged $2.50 on weekdays and $6.00 on weekends.



Toll rates for vehicles with additional axles and at other US 301 interchanges will vary.
Full details are available on DelDOT’s website and will be reflected in an updated toll calculator by August 1.

DMV fee changes take effect October 1
In addition to toll increases, several DMV fees will rise beginning October 1.
This includes a 1% increase in the vehicle document fee and the introduction of a new annual registration fee for alternative fuel vehicles.
The new registration fee will apply to more than 48,000 vehicles statewide.
Delaware residents without an E-ZPass account can sign up and view rates here. Additional information about the alternative fuel vehicle fee and how it will be collected is expected later this year.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Among the state’s cases are two unvaccinated pregnant Utahns. People who become infected with measles during pregnancy are more likely to experience severe symptoms, and are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems, health officials warned. Because the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is not available for people are are already pregnant, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services urged anyone who is thinking of getting pregnant to first receive the vaccine at least four weeks before attempting pregnancy.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota Native tribes and a group of tribal citizens plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a court decision that found they don’t have standing to sue the state of North Dakota for alleged voter discrimination.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in the ruling concluded that private voters have no way of challenging unfair voting practices under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voter discrimination based on race.
“That decision is plainly wrong, and it will have a huge impact on Native voters,” Lenny Powell, a Native American Rights Fund attorney representing the plaintiffs, said in a Tuesday statement. 
The ruling came in a case involving the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal members, who took North Dakota to court over a 2021 redistricting map the tribes say illegally diluted the power of Native voters.
Court denies rehearing voting rights case; group calls decision ‘loss for Native American voters’

North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to adopt a different map.
A panel of three 8th Circuit Court of Appeals judges in May voted 2-1 to reverse that finding. The panel indicated it would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to go into effect, this decision would reinstate the original 2021 map.
The plaintiffs asked the full 8th Circuit to rehear the case, though the court denied that request last week.
Now the plaintiffs are gearing up to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. In a brief filed Wednesday, the plaintiffs asked the 8th Circuit to allow Welte’s map to stay in place until the high court decides whether it will weigh in.
The 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit to find that private individuals cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The court in a 2023 decision in a separate case found that it’s the sole responsibility of the U.S. attorney general to enforce compliance with Section 2.
The 8th Circuit’s findings in the North Dakota case reaffirmed this position. The plaintiffs had attempted to use a separate civil rights statute, Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as an alternative means of bringing their voting rights claim, but the three-judge panel ruled this was not possible.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

While it’s very rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to hear a case, the plaintiffs in their most recent brief argued that the high court may be interested in the lawsuit because of the importance of voting rights and to resolve the different positions the 8th Circuit and other circuits have taken on the issue.
Because of the circuit split, the plaintiffs think there is a “reasonable probability” that at least four of the nine justices on the Supreme Court will want to review the case.
The plaintiffs are hopeful the Supreme Court will ultimately reverse the 8th Circuit’s decision. 
The Supreme Court has always allowed private individuals to file discrimination claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, they argue in the brief.
North Dakota maintains that the 2021 map is not discriminatory and that the tribes lack standing to sue.
The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.

,DC,2025-07-10 18:41:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump emergency tariffs violate Constitution, Democrats argue in court case",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-emergency-tariffs-violate-constitution-democrats-argue-court-case,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Democratic lawmakers argued in a new legal filing this week that President Donald Trump’s sweeping emergency tariffs usurped congressional power, and they urged a federal appellate court to strike down the duties on foreign imports.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is set to hear oral arguments over some of Trump’s tariffs after a lower court blocked them in May. Despite being tied up in court, Trump continued threatening tariffs Wednesday on numerous trading partners, including a 50% import tax on goods from Brazil.Nearly 200 lawmakers signed onto the amicus brief Tuesday, asserting that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, under which Trump triggered the duties, “does not confer the power to impose or remove tariffs.”The lawmakers argued that Trump’s unprecedented use of IEEPA violates Article I of the U.S. Constitution that authorizes Congress to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises” and “regulate commerce with foreign nations.”“This reflects the Framers’ interest in ensuring the most democratically accountable branch — the one closest to the People — be responsible for enacting taxes, duties, and tariffs,” wrote the 191 Democratic members of Congress, citing the Federalist Papers, in their 65-page brief.Congress has “explicitly and specifically” delegated tariff-raising powers to the president, but not under IEEPA, according to the lawmakers.“Unmoored from the structural safeguards Congress built into actual tariff statutes, the President’s unlawful ‘emergency’ tariffs under IEEPA have led to chaos and uncertainty,” the lawmakers wrote.‘Economic chaos,’ price hikes citedSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, co-led the brief with Oregon’s Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also co-led, along with Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York, Joe Neguse of Colorado, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Richard Neal of Massachusetts.In a statement Wednesday, Shaheen said Trump’s “reckless tariff agenda has caused economic chaos and raised prices for families and businesses across the country at a moment in which the cost of living is far too high.”“The Trump Administration’s unlawful abuse of emergency powers to impose tariffs ignores that he does not have the authority to unilaterally impose the largest tax increase in decades on Americans. This brief makes clear that IEEPA cannot be used to impose tariffs,” Shaheen said.May decisionThe U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs in a May 28 decision, following two legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.The lead business plaintiff is V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Following an appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.Triple-digit tariffTrump used IEEPA to declare international trade a national emergency and announced tariffs on nearly every other country on April 2 in what he dubbed as “Liberation Day.”Tariffs reached staggering levels on major U.S. trading partners, including 46% on Vietnam, 25% on South Korea and 20% on the European Union.The announcement wiped trillions from markets, which have largely recovered. Trump delayed all but a 10% base tariff for 90 days on every country except China. Trump fueled a trade war with the massive Asian nation, peaking at a 145% tariff rate, but then temporarily settling between 10% and 55%, depending on the good.Even before Trump shocked the world with his “Liberation Day” announcement, small business owners from around the U.S. told States Newsroom they were bracing for potentially devastating economic effects.The trade court’s ruling — a pending appeals litigation — does not apply to tariffs Trump imposed under other statutes, including national security-related duties on foreign automobiles, as well as steel and aluminum. Some of the steel tariffs, imposed during Trump’s first term, were left in place under former President Joe Biden.",,,,2025-07-10 15:11:38.874754

(Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.

The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.

In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.

Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Congressional Republicans target tax that provides billions to Missouri Medicaid program

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s “incredibly confident” that President Donald Trump will approve emergency federal funds by Thursday afternoon for the devastating Ruidoso floods, as the area braces for further rains forecasted Friday.
NM Gov seeks federal help for Ruidoso flooding that killed 3

Lujan Grisham made her remarks during a news conference in Ruidoso Thursday morning alongside local officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation. She noted that U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem had offered reassurances that federal aid was incoming, including $12 million in previous funds allocated to local officials by the federal government, and potentially $3 million dollars following the approval of the disaster declaration.
“They are already working on getting us the money immediately,” Lujan Grisham said. “That is a very good sign.”
Local and state officials are working to tally the damages in the wake of a 20-foot flash flooding roaring through Ruidoso from rain sluicing off burn scars from fires in 2024. The waters rose on Tuesday afternoon, upending homes, carrying off vehicles and requiring 65 water rescues. Two children, ages 7 and 4, and a man in his 40s or 50s died.
Lujan Grisham expressed her condolences over the lost lives, and said that recovery efforts and safety efforts would need to move quickly to assess the losses and start working to “manage and mitigate the damages, to protect us from more water that is coming.”
One person remains unaccounted for, but search and rescue operations are moving to wrap up Thursday, according to Lincoln County Emergency Manager Eric Holt.

The next stage is working to remove silt from the riverbeds and clear debris before further anticipated rains. The National Guard and local officials set up an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate emergency alerts.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, also spoke at the news conference and urged residents to heed any further evacuation warnings in the coming days, warning that flooding may continue throughout the monsoon season.
“We cannot lose another life,” she said. “It’s really important over the coming days that everyone follow those emergency orders, and we’re going to do everything we can to get dollars, humans, and rescue folks on the ground to make sure that we protect our community.”
Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) whose 2nd Congressional District includes parts of the nearby Mescalero Apache tribal lands and Otero County, said the delegation would continue to pursue additional federal funds.
“We have to make sure that at a state and federal level, we have the adequate resources to be able to handle this in our communities,” he said. “Understand this perhaps is no longer going to be a historic event, but it could be something that we have to face year after year.”
Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford said damages from the flood are in the tens of millions of dollars between bridges, homes and other infrastructure. The floods also stopped water services for about 300 homes. City officials expected further water deliveries Thursday afternoon and asked any residents in need of service to go to the Convention Centers.
“After yesterday, it became very apparent that there was a lot more damage than what we had assumed,” Crawford said.
The water system, which was damaged during the South Fork and Salt wildfires last year, is not experiencing any water quality issues, said Ron Sena, the manager for Ruidoso Village. The outages are in parts of the main drag on Sudderth Drive, and the Upper Camelot and Black Forest neighborhoods.
It will probably take days to restore full water service, Crawford told Source NM.

Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday announced two new leadership appointments of state environmental departments. 
Jason Batchelder, who most recently served as the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, is set to become commissioner of the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. Having previously served as colonel of Fish & Wildlife’s warden service, Batchelder replaces interim Commissioner Andrea Shortsleeve. 
“I’m truly humbled to be asked to rejoin this group of mission-driven individuals who live their work, day in and day out,” Batchelder said in a Wednesday press release. 
Scott selected Misty Sinsigalli to replace Batchelder as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation. She joins the department having previously worked as a disaster recovery lead for the water and environmental programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, according to the release. 
“Misty’s experience at the federal level, as well as her lived experience growing up in Vermont, will be important as we balance conservation with the housing we desperately need in the state,” Scott said in the release. 
Sinsigalli said in the release that she was grateful to lead the department during a challenging time, noting uncertainty in both the physical environment and Washington, D.C.

Scott also appointed Sara Teachout to the Green Mountain Care Board, a key health care regulator in the state. Teachout most recently worked as a lobbyist for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, a health insurer the care board regulates. Care board members are chosen from a list of candidates submitted by the board’s nominating committee. 
Teachout told VTDigger on Thursday that she had resigned from BlueCross and would not participate in this year’s health insurance rate review process. She has almost 20 years of experience in health care policy and fiscal analysis, according to the release.

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)Litigation over Gov. Kim Reynolds’ 2021 refusal to pay pandemic-related jobless assistance to 30,000 Iowans is continuing with a newly filed lawsuit alleging the governor’s decision was unlawful.
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court, mirrors claims made by the same plaintiffs, Karla Smith of Pleasantville and Holly Bladel of Clinton, in a 2021 state-court lawsuit that was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs before being refiled in 2023 in federal court.
The federal lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Stephanie M. Rose, partly due to jurisdictional issues. Rose ruled that one of the lawsuit’s central claims, which cited federal statutes, could not be based on “a violation of state law – even state constitutional law.” Rose also concluded the plaintiffs “did not have a continuing, constitutionally protected property interest in the pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits.”

On June 3, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Eighth Circuit affirmed Rose’s decision. That same day, lawyers for Smith and Bladel filed their new lawsuit in state court, claiming the two women and thousands of other Iowans were illegally denied unemployment benefits in 2021 due to the actions of Reynolds and Iowa Workforce Development Director Beth Townsend.
According to the lawsuit, Reynolds and Townsend violated Iowa’s Employment Security law, which requires the state to “cooperate with the United States Department of Labor to the fullest extent” and make available to Iowans “all advantages available under the provisions of the Social Security Act that relate to unemployment compensation.”
Lawyers for Smith and Bladel are also seeking class-action status in the case in an effort to recover damages for thousands of Iowans who may have been harmed by Reynolds’ decision.
While the state has yet to file a response to the latest lawsuit, the claims were rejected by Reynolds in 2023 when she defended her actions by saying “the federal government doesn’t get to run” the state of Iowa.
“Paying people to stay home at a time when there are more jobs available than people to fill them defies common sense. Iowans know there is dignity in work,” Reynolds said then.
Ohio court recently ruled on issue
Iowa was one of at least 25 states, all led by Republican governors, that chose to terminate federal, pandemic-related unemployment assistance to jobless residents before the programs expired in 2021. The states did so largely in response to labor shortages, claiming the enhanced benefits were encouraging people to remain unemployed rather than return to the workforce.
Ohio was one of those states — and five months ago, in February 2025, as part of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Ohio residents, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas ruled that Gov. Mike DeWine  must reinstate Ohio’s Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program and “take all action necessary to obtain Ohio’s share of FPUC program benefits from the Department of Labor.”
The State of Ohio is now appealing the ruling in an effort to block the federal government’s payment of pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
The litigation in Iowa, Ohio and other states stems from Congress’s March 2020 decision, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, to approve the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security — better known as the CARES Act — to address mass layoffs, business closures and soaring unemployment.
The act provided enhanced unemployment benefits, provided for cash payments to be made to qualified recipients, extended the period of eligibility for benefits, and allowed for benefits to be paid to people who wouldn’t otherwise have been eligible.
Iowans later received letters from Iowa Workforce Development stating they would be eligible for the benefits through Sept. 4, 2021. However, in a May 10, 2021, memorandum, Townsend recommended that Reynolds terminate Iowa’s participation in the federal programs effective June 12, 2021.
The next day, Reynolds officially adopted the recommendation and announced that IWD, which administers many elements of Iowa’s unemployment programs, would be withdrawing from participation in the federal, pandemic-related unemployment programs, despite the fact that they were entirely funded by the federal government.
Iowa’s participation in the programs was terminated on June 12, three months before the programs were set to expire.
At the time, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee warned that Iowa and other states that pulling out of the unemployment programs stood to lose up to $13 billion in economic activity by refusing the infusion of federal money.
Plaintiffs sue over ‘life-sustaining benefits’
Like the previously filed federal lawsuit over Reynolds’ actions, the new, state-court lawsuit alleges the Iowa governor’s “refusal to ensure continued access to federal pandemic-related unemployment benefits” deprived approximately 30,000 Iowans of “life-sustaining benefits” to which they were entitled. The lawsuit also notes that the number of Iowans affected by Reynolds’ decision might exceed 55,000.
The governor’s decision to prematurely terminate Iowa’s involvement in the programs “violated clear legislative mandates and constituted an unlawful exercise of executive authority,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Iowa’s Employment Security Law specifically required the state to provide citizens with “all advantages available under the provisions of the Social Security Act that relate to unemployment compensation.”
Smith, who worked at Casey’s General Store when the pandemic hit, alleges that in mid-March 2020, her doctor told her a preexisting lung condition made it dangerous for her to continue working in a retail setting that had yet to install Plexiglas dividers at workstations and didn’t require face masks.
Smith alleges she quit her job to self-quarantine and began collecting PEUC benefits of $408 per week in addition to FPUC benefits to pay for food, housing, and other monthly expenses. Reynolds’ and Townsend’s decision to terminate Iowa’s involvement in the federal programs left Smith without a critical source of income just as the Delta variant surged, the lawsuit claims.
Bladel worked for a restaurant and gas station but was replaced after seeking time off to care for an elderly relative who was immunocompromised and at risk for COVID-19. She then began collecting PUA and FPUC benefits until Iowa terminated its involvement in the programs.
The lawsuit is one of two active cases the plaintiffs are pursuing in state court over the unemployment issue. The other case, initiated in November 2024, is basically an appeal of the administrative decisions made by the state, and seeks judicial review of those decisions.
In that case, the state is seeking dismissal of the lawsuit and has accused the plaintiffs of having “shopped their lawsuit around first to state court, then to federal court, and now they are back to state court.”

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)Gov. Henry McMaster recently held a ceremonial bill signing for H.3430, the tort reform bill, which he hailed as a “great victory.”
The new law will take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, but before then, we think South Carolinians deserve a clear-eyed account of what happened — and what’s still at stake.
This legislative session opened with what we saw as a sweeping effort to roll back victims’ rights. S.244 was a bill that aimed to rewrite the long-standing liability laws that are imperative to protecting everyday people who are harmed by the negligent, the reckless, and the outright dangerous.
After weeks of debate and the hard work of legislators and individuals who fought to protect the safety and rights of all South Carolinians, some of the most dangerous provisions of that original bill were removed.
Our collective efforts to raise awareness and push for victims to be kept at the forefront of decision-making made a significant difference. Unfortunately, we believe the final legislation, H.3430, still creates serious problems for victims seeking justice.
Firstly, H.3430 permits blame-shifting loopholes by allowing the addition of non-parties on jury verdict forms. People or entities who aren’t even in the courtroom could be added and may never be held responsible, leaving victims to pick up the bill for medical costs, lost wages, and long-term financial hardships.
That undermines the very concept of accountability in our civil justice system.
Secondly, H.3430 does not include stronger penalties for drunken driving, a solution that would actually help lower liability rates.
South Carolina is currently ranked worst in the nation for DUI fatality rates, which is one of the reasons our liability rates are so high. An alternative reform bill, passed unanimously by the House, H.3497, included additional DUI penalties, but that bill ultimately did not pass the Senate.
Our state’s embarrassing DUI rates should be a wake-up call to legislators that something must be done, yet when given the opportunity to address this crisis, we did not, and H.3430 does nothing to deter drunken driving or help victims.
Finally, and perhaps most frustratingly, while H.3430 has been sold as a solution to skyrocketing insurance costs, there’s still no guarantee that premiums will go down — not for restaurant owners, not for consumers, not for anyone.
During weeks of testimony and debate, we did not see a single representative from the insurance industry testify that the proposed bill would guarantee lower rates.
What is guaranteed? That insurance companies will continue to grow their profits while facing less scrutiny and fewer obligations to the people they serve.
This bill didn’t fix a crisis. It simply passed the burden onto victims.
H.3430 was just the beginning; another threat to victims’ rights is already being planned.
But when the next attempt to undermine the protection of innocent South Carolinians is revealed, lawyers, victims, and small business owners will once again be ready to stand up and fight back, together.
We are closely watching other states, like Florida, where a state committee is now investigating whether insurers misled lawmakers by hiding billion-dollar profits while claiming extensive losses, which contributed to the passage of a sweeping tort reform package in 2023.
And we’re building even stronger support and alliances to fight for the rights of victims across our state. To the advocates, survivors, business owners, and everyday folks who stood up against the bill this year: thank you. Your calls, your testimony, and your engagement made a significant difference.
The fight for justice is far from over, but our commitment is deep-seated and unwavering.
The South Carolina Association for Justice and our partners will always fight for victims.
We will always stand for accountability. And we will never stop working to protect the rights of all South Carolinians.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4613-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

(Courtesy of Louisiana Sea Grant)The largest commercial fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico is accidentally killing and discarding more than 22,000 redfish annually in Louisiana waters, according to an independent study released Tuesday, though state regulators noted that is still fewer than the number of dead redfish recreational anglers discard each year.    
Scientists with LGL Ecological Research Associates presented results of its “menhaden bycatch study” to the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, unveiling the most up-to-date, comprehensive accounting of how the menhaden industry is impacting other fish species in the ecosystem.
Menhaden, also known as pogy, are small foraging fish that live in large shoals off the Gulf Coast. Rich in omega-3 fats and oils, the fish are harvested primarily for pet food, dietary supplements and food ingredients. 
Funded with $1 million from the Louisiana Legislature and overseen by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the LGL study found menhaden harvesting unintentionally caught an estimated 145 million fish of other species, or bycatch, during the 2024 season, which went from April through October.
Researchers worked aboard commercial pogy boats for seven months counting fish and conducting experiments to determine what kills the bycatch species and what helps them survive. Data was collected from these at-sea observers and electronic monitoring such as on-board cameras. 
Although they recorded dozens of different species in the bycatch, the researchers focused much of their attention on redfish, one of the most coveted targets of Gulf Coast recreational anglers.
Much of the unintentionally caught fish is retained and processed along with the menhaden, but a significant portion is discarded back into the sea dead or injured. The total dead fish that menhaden boats discarded last year included an estimated 22,000 redfish, 9,000 black drum, 33,000 catfish and 10,000 sharks, among other species. 
Still, the number of dead redfish discarded by the commercial menhaden industry is less than the number discarded by recreational anglers, according to a Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries news release that compared the new research with separate data that did not appear in the study.

The agency noted the menhaden industry’s dead redfish bycatch accounted for 9.9% of the total redfish harvested in the state. The overwhelming share, 90.1%, are taken by recreational anglers, who keep 78.9% and discard and kill 11.2% of the total redfish, according to the Wildlife and Fisheries Department. The study made no mention of that recreational harvest data.
The research results come just over a year after the state Wildlife and Fisheries Commission placed tighter restrictions on redfish for recreational anglers, citing the species’ declining numbers. The agency lowered the daily catch limit from five to four per person and upped the minimum size limit from 16 inches to 18 inches. The changes drew outcry from charter boat captains who make their living taking clients out to catch redfish.  
Some blamed commercial fishing for the decline in redfish numbers. State lawmakers intervened with funding for the new bycatch study and pressed regulators to implement a menhaden exclusion zone that prohibits commercial fishing within a half-mile of land along much of the coastline and 3 miles in select areas. 
Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Cut Off, who has spearheaded much of the menhaden industry legislation, said he was impressed with the study. In a phone interview Wednesday, Orgeron pointed to the finding that surprised him most: Bycatch survival was high for fish released directly from the nets but was very low for fish that enter the pogy boats’ chute systems. 
Those chute systems were designed to separate and release larger fish species that are unintentionally caught. When menhaden are corralled into what’s called a purse seine net, the bycatch species are also trapped. Crews use a large hose to vacuum the menhaden onto the boat, and on the front end of the hose is what the industry calls a “shark cage,” which is essentially a large metal screen that’s supposed to prevent  larger fish from being vacuumed. 
But shark cage designs vary among companies, and the less effective cages do little to stop large fish and sharks from getting sucked into the hose alongside the menhaden, so the catch is pumped through a secondary excluder grate onboard the boat. Serving essentially like a second shark cage, the excluder grate is supposed to separate the bigger fish and then send them down a release chute back into the sea. 
However, researchers found most of the larger fish that slip through the hose cage end up being dismembered before they even make it to the secondary excluder grate. So the very system designed to save the fish and release them back into the sea is actually killing them. 
Trump’s floating fish farms might surface in the Gulf of Mexico despite opposition

This is especially true for redfish, which had a mortality rate of 98% after entering the chute system. Other species had slightly better chances of surviving, but overall the system was a death sentence for the fish, the study found.
The findings have already prompted changes at one of the Gulf’s largest menhaden fleets, Ocean Harvesters. Ben Landry, the company’s vice president of public affairs, said all boats in their fleet now use a more effective hose cage to keep bycatch from entering the chute system. 
“We’ve seen some improvements in terms of what fish are coming up the chute,” Landry said in a phone call. 
Following Tuesday’s presentation, groups on opposite sides of the issue touted the study as vindication of their position.
Bob Vanasse, spokesperson for the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, said the study reaffirms that the menhaden industry is sustainable and poses no threat to Louisiana’s redfish populations. He pointed to a news release his organization published highlighting the large percentage of redfish removals attributed to recreational fishing. 
“This independent science reaffirms what we’ve always said: the Gulf menhaden fishery is guided by data, not politics or guesswork,” Vanasse said. “These findings must inform any future regulatory decisions. This is a model of how transparency, swift industry action, and investment in better gear deliver real conservation gains without compromising coastal jobs or economies.”
Richard Fischer, who heads the Louisiana Charter Boat Association, said the number of redfish the menhaden industry kills might be smaller in proportion but is still significant when considering other factors.
“I think recreational fishermen would argue that the economic impact they bring to the state, $3.1 billion annually, according to the American Sportfishing Association … is far greater than the economic impact the menhaden industry has on the state,” Fischer said. “There’s also a lot of other non-target species killed by the menhaden industry. Redfish is just the attention grabber.”
Researchers found other animals died after getting caught in the pogy nets. They included three brown pelicans and a laughing sea gull. Several protected species, including a giant manta ray, dolphins and sea turtles were unintentionally caught, but the boat crews were able to save and release them. 
Fischer said he hopes the study will help settle the disagreements and allow both sides — the recreational and commercial fisheries — to come together to find a solution that works for everyone.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Supreme Court handed a legal loss Thursday to opponents of a Lincoln County prison site lawmakers have already abandoned.
In a unanimous ruling, the justices decided that Lincoln County residents don’t have the right to force the state to adhere to local zoning ordinances.
Representatives from the nonprofit organization Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion, or NOPE, sought to force the issue with a lawsuit filed in 2023, shortly after the state announced its decision to place a 1,500-bed men’s prison on farm ground about 14 miles south of Sioux Falls.
Prison opponents tell SD Supreme Court the state should have county permission to build

The neighbors wanted the state to seek a conditional use permit for the prison. The state argued that counties don’t have the authority to regulate what the state does with its own land.
The neighbors lost at the circuit court level, but appealed to the state’s high court. The justices heard arguments in March. 
The justices didn’t decide if the state has immunity from local zoning restrictions. Instead, they ruled that neighbors lack the legal standing to enforce those ordinances through a lawsuit, leaving the underlying question of the state’s authority to sidestep county rules untouched.
The practical weight of Thursday’s decision in the state’s ongoing prison debate is essentially null. The state’s Project Prison Reset task force voted earlier this year to scratch the original Lincoln County site from its list of options, and voted this week to recommend building on one of two vacant industrial sites on the northeastern edge of Sioux Falls.

(Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Berkeley Township improperly denied a secession request from a neighborhood detached from the rest of the township by a 30-minute drive, several other towns, and more than a mile of water, New Jersey’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
Justice Anne Patterson, writing for a unanimous court, said South Seaside Park’s proposed deannexation from Berkeley Township “would not cause a significant injury to the Township’s well-being.”
The high court’s affirmation of lower court decisions is the latest shift in South Seaside Park’s more than decade-long effort to join the neighboring Borough of Seaside Park and split from Berkeley, a municipality with which it shares no border.
Geography played a major role in the court’s decision.
South Seaside Park is a barrier island community in Ocean County that sits across the Barnegat Bay from Berkeley.
To reach the opposite shore of the bay in Berkeley, South Seaside Park residents must embark on a 15-mile drive that runs through Seaside Park, Seaside Heights, Island Heights, Toms River, South Toms River, Beachwood, and Pine Beach.
“In the off-season, that trip can take a half hour, and during the summer, it can take forty-five minutes or more,” Patterson wrote.
Separate cable providers serve the township and South Seaside Park, and broadcasts of Berkeley’s public meetings are not carried on the latter’s network.
The distance and the sparseness of municipal facilities within South Seaside Park — it has a basketball court and a public beach with restrooms and one water fountain — meant denying the neighborhood’s request to deannex would harm its residents, the court ruled.
An attorney for the township did not immediately return a request for comment. Assemblyman Greg McGuckin (R-Ocean), who represented the South Seaside Park residents who brought the suit, declined to comment. His legislative district includes Seaside Park.
 It can take a half-hour or longer to get from the South Seaside Park neighborhood of Berkeley Township to mainland Berkeley on the other side of Barnegat Bay.
 Planning board rejection
Berkeley’s planning board in 2020 recommended rejecting South Seaside Park’s petition for deannexation after years of hearings, arguing the neighborhood’s residents had not shown the types of harms that would justify a split. Berkeley’s council followed those recommendations with a vote against deannexation.
But before the Supreme Court, Berkeley failed each leg of a three-prong test used to measure the validity of its rejection, and for the first time in such a case, the court found bias drove planning board recommendations against a neighborhood’s request to split with its municipality.
It found the planning board’s denial of South Seaside Park’s request to join Seaside Park was arbitrary or unreasonable because the board coordinated with Berkeley’s township council to oppose the move rather than acting as an impartial arbiter, as called for by the law.
The board’s planner, the court found, coordinated litigation strategy with the township, annotated transcripts to suggest themes for the township’s opposition, and helped prepare the township’s witnesses.
One board member who was also a member of the township council encouraged elderly residents to appear and oppose the proposal — then did not recuse from the matter, the court said.
“Even the professional planner retained by the Planning Board in this case acknowledged that a board reviewing a deannexation petition must act in an open-minded and unbiased manner, conducting the proceedings fairly and objectively assessing the evidence in its report to the governing body,” Patterson wrote. “Here, the Planning Board did not act in accordance with that standard.”
The case is the first deannexation matter to reach the high court with an allegation of bias. At least two cases involving allegations of bias previously came before appellate courts, but those courts rejected them. In one, they found a mayor’s comment against deannexation was inconsequential. In the other, planning board members who opposed deannexation recused themselves.
The high court acknowledged South Seaside Park’s departure would harm Berkeley Township taxpayers, who township officials said would see their property tax bills rise by an average $148 if the neighborhood deannexed.
South Seaside Park accounts for about 2% of Berkeley’s population and roughly 11% of its property tax base, experts for the neighborhood told the court.
But those costs would be at least partially offset by services — two police vehicles and auxiliary officers for the summer season, among others — the township would no longer have to provide to South Seaside Park.
The township’s remaining residents wouldn’t face social harms from the deannexation because South Seaside Park residents were already so removed from other residents, the court found.

Larry Rhoden announced the appointment Thursday of a state senator to fill an empty seat in a legislative district that includes the cities of Huron and Redfield.
The appointee is Brandon Wipf, a Republican from Lake Byron.
“Brandon Wipf has a keen understanding of our property tax system and reflects South Dakota’s strong values,” Rhoden said in a news release. “As a dedicated farmer and ag advocate, he is equipped with an understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing our number one industry. I have no doubt that he will serve our state with excellence.”
Rhoden’s office described Wipf as a farmer in southern Spink County who serves on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Ag Advisory Council and is a director for the American Soybean Association. He graduated as the valedictorian from James Valley Christian School in 2004 and obtained a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Dordt University in Iowa.
“I’m incredibly honored and grateful for the trust the governor has placed in me,” Wipf said in the release. “I will work hard to earn that same trust from the people of District 22.”
Wipf succeeds David Wheeler, a Republican and lawyer who resigned his state Senate seat in April to accept an appointment as a circuit court judge.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.

Many Connecticut residents are financially struggling, but it’s not half.
While no recent study has used a “paycheck-to-paycheck” framing, 39% of Connecticut households were struggling to make ends meet in 2022, including nearly 11% of families living in poverty, according to a 2024 report issued by the United Way in Connecticut.
The United Way uses a methodology called ALICE — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — identifying families unable “to afford the basic cost of living in their county” but often ineligible for public assistance programs. About 28.8% of the 39%, or 563,512 struggling households, were ALICE families.
A family of four needed over $113,000 annually in 2022 to cover basic costs.

Rejecting the plan would represent a loss for the Trump administration after passage of the “big, beautiful” tax and spending cut law earlier this month.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., appears optimistic he can secure the votes needed to begin debate, though he hasn’t said publicly if he thinks the bill can actually pass. “We’ll have it up on the floor next week. Hopefully, we get on it and then we’ll have an amendment process,” Thune said during a Wednesday press conference. “And kind of like a budget reconciliation bill, it's an open amendment process, a vote-a-rama type process, which I’m sure you’re very excited about.”JD Vance needed again?At least 50 Republicans must agree to proceed to the legislation amid unified opposition from Democrats. Thune can only lose three GOP senators and still begin debate with Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. Rescissions bills are exempt from the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.After a maximum of 10 hours of debate, the Senate will begin a marathon amendment voting session that could substantially reshape the measure.There may be enough Republican votes to completely remove the section rescinding $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and hundreds of local public media stations.Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds all brought up misgivings during a June hearing about how canceling previously approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would impact rural communities and emergency alerts.Collins, R-Maine, also raised concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back previously approved funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, and is likely to bring an amendment to the floor on that issue, according to her office. PEPFAR is a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS that was led by President George W. Bush.Democrats will get to offer as many amendments as they want during the vote-a-rama and could try to remove each section of the bill one by one, forcing Republicans to weigh in publicly on numerous foreign aid programs.45 days for Trump requestPresident Donald Trump sent Congress the rescissions request in early June, starting a 45-day clock for lawmakers to consider his proposal.The recommendation asked lawmakers to cancel $8.3 billion in foreign aid funding, including $500 million for certain global health programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development.“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs,” the request states. “This rescission proposal aligns with the Administration's efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs.”The House voted mostly along party lines in mid-June to approve the rescissions request, but the legislation sat around the Senate for weeks as Republicans struggled to pass their “big, beautiful” law.The Senate can vote to approve the proposal as is, change it, or let it expire, forcing the White House budget office to spend the money, which it’s been able to legally freeze since sending Congress the rescissions request.Relations with White HouseSenators’ decision will impact how Republicans in that chamber, especially Thune and those on the Appropriations Committee, work with White House budget director Russ Vought in the coming months and years.Congress and the Trump administration must broker some sort of funding agreement before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1 to stave off a shutdown.Vought has also said he plans to send lawmakers additional rescissions requests, though he hasn’t said exactly when or what programs he’ll include.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Thursday as the panel debated three of the full-year government funding bills that the rescissions package is not acceptable and could impede the committee’s traditionally bipartisan work.“We need to make sure decisions about what to fund and, yes, what to rescind are made here in Congress on a bipartisan basis and within our annual funding process,” Murray said. “We cannot allow bipartisan funding bills with partisan rescission packages. It will not work. And that is why I will repeat my commitment to all of my colleagues that on this side of the dais, we stand ready to discuss rescissions as part of these bipartisan spending bills.”",,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)After losing the Number One ranking to Virginia in 2024, North Carolina has reclaimed bragging rights as the Top State for Business in 2025 according to CNBC.
“Our people, state’s business climate, top research universities and excellent community college system, infrastructure, and high quality of life help both companies and workers thrive,” said Gov. Josh Stein on Thursday.
Stein praised state legislators of both parties as well as former Governor Roy Cooper in helping North Carolina create a welcoming business climate.
The high ranking from CNBC is nothing new for the state. Since 2007, North Carolina has enjoyed an average ranking of 4.5 in the survey under governors and legislatures led by both major parties. Its lowest ranking was 12th in 2013. It’s been ranked first, second or third since 2019, though no survey was published during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
CNBC’s annual ranking measures states across 10 categories of competitiveness. The categories where North Carolina demonstrated its biggest strengths this year were the economy, its workforce, and the state’s business friendliness. In a state of more than 11 million people, the unemployment rate stands at 3.7%.
The categories in which North Carolina received its lowest marks were quality of life (earning a C-) and cost of living (earning a C+) in the 2025 ranking.
“Our strength lies in our ability to connect companies with the workforce, infrastructure, sites, industry ecosystems, and innovation resources needed to support their growth, as well as a business-friendly environment that’s especially valuable in times of economic uncertainty,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina.
Since January, state commerce officials have announced business expansions or new projects yielding nearly $17 billion of new capital investment with an expectation of adding more than 20,000 new jobs. Last month, JetZero announced it would bring a $4.7 billion investment to Greensboro for its new production facility creating more than 14500 jobs by 2063. The announcement marked the largest economic development project in North Carolina history based on the job commitment.
Promoting the state, the promise of recovery
CNBC announced North Carolina’s Number One ranking Thursday in a televised interview with Gov. Stein in Wilmington on the USS North Carolina Battleship.
Stein used his time in the national spotlight to lift up western North Carolina and the tourism industry as it continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
“We have a [new] ad campaign, which is ‘Rediscover the Unforgettable.’ People need to come to western North Carolina. If you’ve been here, you know what I’m talking about. And if you haven’t, you’ll be thrilled that you did,” said Stein in effort to promote a part of the state that sustained $60 billion in damages nine months ago.
Stein visited the Town of Clyde earlier this week to award one of the first grants from the Small Business Infrastructure Grant Program, which is helping local governments rebuild public infrastructure.
Helene left Clyde’s downtown six-to-eight feet underwater. This week told a much brighter story.
“I could not tell that from any storefront I walked in. Everyone was fresher than it has ever been,” Stein said in touting the speed at which some businesses have been able to reopen.
  Gov. Stein recently signed the latest Helene recovery bill, directing nearly $300 million to the NCDOT to be used for recovery in impacted areas. (Photo: NCDOT)
But Stein made clear in his CNBC interview that help from the federal government was still very much needed, even as the Trump administration has questioned whether FEMA should continue to provide states help.
“North Carolina is a bigger state than most. So, we have a pretty sophisticated emergency response team. But here’s the thing, we don’t get a huge storm every year. The country does,” reasoned Stein. “It doesn’t make sense for each state to have a fully staffed emergency response team because they may not have a storm for five-years or 10 years. But we know the country will.”
Stein reiterated that the state cannot bear the full cost of recovery, only the federal government can do that.
There’s currently an $11.5 billion request for storm recovery before Congress and the Trump administration.
“I eagerly hope they fund [it] soon,” said the governor.
New storm clouds on the horizon
Beyond natural disasters, Stein expressed concern that Trump’s one big, beautiful bill could mean billions of dollars in lost revenue for state’s Medicaid program.
“This bill is going to result in real harm to North Carolina, harm to our people, harm to our health care system,” said Stein.
A recent report by the General Assembly’s Fiscal Research Division highlights a $32 billion loss to the state budget and hospitals over the next decade.
Stein said the federal changes would result in hundreds of thousands of people potentially losing their health care coverage with rural hospitals feeling financial strain.

“Obviously we need to work with our North Carolina legislature to make sure that we don’t abandon the bipartisan win we had together,” said Stein.
Both House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate President Phil Berger praised the new CNBC business ranking on social media posts Thursday. Neither, however, mentioned the challenges Stein outlined, or news of any progress toward a final state budget, ten days into the new fiscal year.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Polk County water report pins unhealthy rivers on ag pollution

Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.
Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.

“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is a breaking story and will be updated. 
A federal district court judge in New Hampshire said Thursday he will issue an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and will hold that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t currently have injunctions, but it will be stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid. 
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of US citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the forthcoming ruling in a press conference after the hearing. 
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s ruling comes weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa, Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class action lawsuits: national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held. 
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action lawsuit designation in order to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action lawsuit within days of the Casa decision in June. 
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities. 
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action lawsuits, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants. 
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said. 
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there. 
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order. In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4953-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

Bob Ferguson and Senate Republican Leader John Braun have teamed up to persuade voters to let the state make stock market investments with tax dollars collected for its new long-term care program.
Ferguson endorses a measure on the Nov. 4 ballot to amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. Any earnings would be plowed back into the program.
The governor joined five others, including Braun, of Centralia, to sign the voters’ pamphlet statement urging approval of Senate Joint Resolution 8201.
It is a “common sense measure that ensures tax dollars go further,” they wrote. It will “increase funding without impacting taxpayers” and “guarantee” benefits are there when individuals need them, it reads.
Four state lawmakers — a Democrat and three Republicans — penned the statement opposing the measure. They argue it would be “financial roulette” to put the money in “an unstable market.” Right now, “it’s safeguarded in secured investments like federal, state and municipal bonds which support our communities.”
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, is one of the signatories in the opposition camp.
“You are betting that corporations will maximize their profits, which always come off the backs of working people,” he said. “It’s really cynical to gamble that corporations are going to win.”
The playing field
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work. As of March, $2 billion in tax collections had been banked in the program’s trust fund.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky. 
Senate Joint Resolution 8201, which passed by margins of 42-7 in the Senate and 86-9 in the House earlier this year, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
Those leading this year’s campaign said that they need to do a better job communicating that the Washington State Investment Board could produce higher earnings on WA Cares Fund assets that would translate into lower premiums and more benefits.
There were no lawmakers on the 2020 statement while the opposition had two — Hasegawa and the now-retired Republican state senator, Mike Padden.
Overall, the political environment is different, supporters said. The pandemic is over, the program is more widely understood and, last fall, voters rejected an initiative that sought to torpedo the program by making it voluntary rather than mandatory.
A campaign spokesperson said a recent internal polling found support in “the mid-50s.” At this point five years ago, the measure had only around 30% backing.
Those pushing the constitutional amendment note that some lawmakers who signed the opposition statement invest their money in the stock market.
Rep. Peter Abbarno, R-Centralia, who crafted the opposition statement with Hasegawa, is one.
“There is a big difference,” Abbarno said, “between a private individual who diversifies their portfolio versus a public official who invests somebody else’s money before knowing what the benefits will cost and what the exact design of the program will be. You have to be much more cautious when you have a fiduciary responsibility.”

Commissioner Brian Maher of Lincoln, 63, a lifelong educator who has served as state commissioner since July 2023, said his “vision” for NU is “a report card for the future” focused on achievement, alignment and a pathway for students to enter and succeed in NU, affordability in tuition and taxpayer dollars and enhancing NU’s appeal for in-state and out-of-state students.

Maher also said he would prioritize helping NU gain reinstatement into the prestigious American Association of Universities, a similar goal of Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, whom Maher is seeking to succeed. NU had been a member of the AAU for more than 100 years until it was voted out in 2011 for not meeting certain membership criteria.
“I’m running for the Board of Regents to ensure the next generation of Nebraskans has access to an affordable, high-quality education — and the opportunity to thrive here in our great state,” Maher said in a statement. “The University of Nebraska has given so much to my family. It’s time for us to give back.”
The District 1 seat Maher is running for is held by Clare, who told the Lincoln Journal Star in April that he would not seek a fourth six-year term next year. The district includes the northern half of Lincoln, as well as the surrounding communities of Emerald, Malcolm, Agnew, Raymond and Davey.
‘A report card for the future’
Maher is a first-generation college graduate who was born and raised in Hooper as the youngest of seven children. Maher and his wife Peg raised three children who were all educated at NU and competed in varsity athletics.
Across a 40-year career in education, Maher’s tenure includes being a teacher at Elkhorn and Clarks Public Schools; a school administrator at Waverly, Elkhorn and Johnson-Brock Public Schools; superintendent of Kearney and Centennial Public Schools in Nebraska, as well as at the Sioux Falls School District in South Dakota; and as CEO of the South Dakota Board of Regents (the Nebraska equivalent of NU president), where he served from 2020 to 2023 before returning to Nebraska.
Maher earned a doctorate in educational administration from NU. In 2015, he was awarded the “Nebraska Superintendent of the Year,” his final year in Kearney.

Maher enters the race with the endorsements of all eight members of the officially nonpartisan State Board of Education that selects an education commissioner. The members are four Republicans and four Democrats. 
The state board last month unanimously voted to extend Maher’s contract one more year, to July 2027. He was appointed in March 2023 on a 5-3 vote at a time when the board also was split 4-4, with one Republican joining Democrats.
The Republican members of the state board endorsing Maher are Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte (chair), Kirk Penner of Aurora, Sherry Jones of Grand Island and Lisa Schonhoff of Bennington. The Democratic board endorsing him are Deb Neary of Omaha (vice chair), Kristin Christensen of Lincoln, Maggie Douglas of Bellevue and Liz Renner of Omaha.
Former Lincoln Public Schools Superintendent Steve Joel also endorsed Maher.
Maher’s immediate predecessor, former Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt now works for NU as its associate vice president for government relations.
Commissioner decision, district boundaries
Campaign spokesperson Derek Oden said Maher “fully intends to continue faithfully serving” as commissioner through the campaign. If elected, Maher does intend to step down “to fully commit himself” to the NU Board of Regents.

That means the State Board of Education could be searching for a new ed commissioner in 2027, and the 2026 election could decide the partisan split of the board and the ease with which a new commissioner is selected. 
In 2026, the seats of three Republicans (Jones, Penner and Tegtmeier) and one Democrat (Neary) are up for election.
Maher joins the officially nonpartisan race for regent with Lincoln entrepreneur Brent Comstock, 29, who announced his candidacy in early June. Clare is a registered Republican, and so is Maher. Comstock is a registered nonpartisan. The NU board is currently 6-2 majority Republican.
Clare ran unopposed in 2014 and 2020 and won in 2008 with 58% of the vote. New district boundaries took effect in 2021 and match those of State Board of Education District 1, which elected newcomer Christensen with 58% of the vote in a highly watched election in November. She succeeded former State Board of Education member Patsy Koch Johns, a Democrat first elected in 2016.
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 NU regents race will advance to the November 2026 election.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Mike Dunleavy said on Tuesday that the state has no such plans.
The Dunleavy administration statement was prompted by an inaccurate story by Newsweek that summarized the interview, asserting that the state had suggested the idea.
“The story is false,” said Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s director of communications by email. He said that he had demanded a correction from the Newsweek reporter.
The Newsweek story referred to a July 1 interview on Fox News by host Laura Ingraham of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for pPolicy and homeland security adviser. Miller is known as the architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and a vocal proponent of ramping up ICE arrests, detention and mass deportations.
In the interview, Ingraham and Miller praised Florida for building a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” for its isolation and being surrounded by wildlife in the Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Ochopee, Florida. It was constructed in just eight days, and can hold up to 3,000 detainees before deportation, and opened last week.
Miller said he had pitched all Republican governors to build similar ICE detention facilities. “We want every governor of a red state, and if you’re watching tonight, pick up the phone call, DHS, work with us to build facilities in your state,” Miller said.
Ingraham said Fox reached out to states, including Alaska, for comment. “Alaska told us that ‘we don’t have alligators, but we have lots of bears.’ However, they aren’t aware of any plans for an Alaska version,” she said.
“Of, I said, ‘Bear Alcatraz,’” Ingraham added, chuckling.
When asked to comment on Alaska’s response to Fox News, Turner repeated there were no state plans to build such a facility.
“I am not aware of any response from the state to Mr. Miller for a facility like the one in Florida,” Turner said. “The governor’s office was asked by Fox News if there were any such plans and the answer was no.”
Last week, President Donald Trump signed his signature domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which allocates a historic increase of $165 billion to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which administers ICE, through 2029. ICE’s budget is currently $10 billion.
The Department of Homeland Security said $165 billion includes $45 billion for new ICE detention facilities, $46 billion for border wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border, $14 billion for deportation operations, and billions for hiring 6,000 new Customs and Border Patrol agents, and 10,000 new ICE agents.

U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) hosted an online press conference Wednesday along with fellow west Michigan Democrats, state Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo and state Rep. Carol Glanville of Walker, to discuss the legislation signed last week by President Donald Trump.
“This bill is not fiscally responsible, and this is something that matters deeply to me at a time when American debt is crippling our economy,” Scholten said.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years, according to its most recent analysis. It will make permanent the 2017 tax cuts from Trump’s first term and provide billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.
But it’s the downstream effects the legislation will have on Michigan’s budget that was most concerning to McCann and Glanville.
“The state of Michigan is going to have to deal with the fallout from this. Our health care system is going to have to see the fallout from this,” McCann said. “Rural health care especially is going to suffer.”
McCann pointed to the Michigan Hospital Association’s recent statement that the Medicaid cuts in the bill would be “disastrous” for health care in the state.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“That really sends a signal to me, when you hear those kinds of statements coming out of an organization that typically stays out of the partisan fray of policymaking, but is weighing in heavily here with these warnings of the dire consequences of the situation,” McCann said.
Glanville said while the budget cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food assistance will have a devastating effect on the most vulnerable Michiganders, many other sectors of the state’s budget will also be impacted because of Republican’s emphasis on favoring the wealthiest Americans.
“The cost of utilities, child care, you name it, everything in our state budget is intertwined, and so when we start making these tax breaks for the wealthy, we need to remember they are not free. The money has to come from somewhere,” Glanville said.
One particular piece of the state’s budget that will now be much harder to fully fund is crafting a long-term deal to finance road repairs.
When the GOP-led state House failed to produce a complete budget proposal prior to the July 1 statutory deadline, one of the key issues mentioned as a sticking point was a road repair plan. While the House passed a $3.1 billion road repair plan in March, the Democratic-controlled state Senate has declined to take up the proposal.

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) has held firm that any road repair plan must be part of completing an overall state budget. 
McCann on Wednesday indicated that the money available for a road plan will now be much harder to find as lawmakers face the depletion of federal funds for critical social programs.
“What this legislation from Washington does, is it just really injects more uncertainty and chaos into our long-term outlook and so it may certainly impact the dynamics and the considerations as we look at long-term sustainable road funding,” McCann said.

Glanville concurred, saying the lack of a budget proposal from the House, coupled with the certainty of federal budget cuts, makes a road funding plan much harder to focus on.
“When it comes to the roads plan, it’s hard to say. We keep talking about the choices we have to make,” Glanville said. “At the same time we need to fund our roads, we need to fund education, we need to fund health care, we need to take care of our beautiful tourism industry, our agriculture, all of those things are things that we as a state have, historically put forward as priorities.”
She said the choice they now face is to what extent they can find the money for those priorities when the fact is the state relies on the federal government to provide a major share of funding for things like Medicaid.
According to the state budget office, Medicaid makes up 32% of Michigan’s fiscal year 2025 budget, with nearly three-quarters of that funding coming from the federal government. 
“When that money disappears or is in question, that puts us in a position where it’s very difficult to determine how that funding is going to flow. We have the governor’s proposal, we have the Senate proposal, we have nothing from the House,” Glanville said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8629-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

(Courtesy of Canyon County Parks, Cultural and Natural Resources Department)Sections of the Celebration Boat Ramp Area in Melba will be under construction for improvements from July 14 until late spring 2026. 
Parts of the parking lot, campground areas and boat launch will be closed at various stages of construction, according to a press release from the Canyon County board of commissioners. The public may access alternate day-use parking areas in the park and other camping areas at the East End Campground sites, the press release said. 
The improvements to Snake River park will include updated infrastructure, Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant accessibility, and will “promote user activities” at the park, the release said. The project will mark the first time in more than 30 years the boat ramp area has seen a “major improvement,” according to the release. 
“This boater access spot has been used by local fishing guides, jet boat groups, law enforcement, and the public for decades,” Parks Director Nicki Schwend said in the release. “This project is going to be an upgraded, ADA-accessible design that will help us better meet the needs of all boat user groups. We’re excited for this project and for all the continued improvements happening at Celebration Park.”
The boat ramp and dock area is not expected to close until fall. Alternate boat access can be found at the Swan Falls River Access, Walters Ferry Boat Ramp, Map Rock site, and the Marsing Boat Ramp.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.



As of July 10, New Mexico’s Department of Health had reported 95 measles cases spread over eight counties, with more than 70% of those —67 cases — in Lea County. Of the 95 cases, 52 were among unvaccinated people; 28 had unknown vaccination statuses; and 15 had at least one vaccine.
NMDOH at the start of the month also reported an outbreak of more than a dozen cases at the Luna County Detention Center. Regular wastewater testing has also detected measles in Deming, Rio Rancho and Roswell.
Since the start of February, more than 40,000 residents have received an measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a 95% increase from the same time period last year. Read all of Source’s measles coverage here.



Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The road leading to the back steps of South Carolina’s Statehouse received a $25.5 million makeover in an effort to bolster pedestrian safety and make the area more appealing to visitors, state officials said Thursday.
Formerly a five-lane road, the four-block stretch of South Main Street now has two car lanes.
The sidewalks were extended, allowing for more seating outside coffee shops and restaurants, and bike lanes were added.
More trees and planters frame the Statehouse from the end of the street, giving it the sort of iconic view that might appear on a post card, said pre-construction manager Travis Jolly.
  The South Carolina Department of Transportation says the green sidewalks denoting bike lanes are a first of their kind in the state. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
“This isn’t just Columbia’s Main Street,” said state Rep. Seth Rose, D-Columbia. “This is the state of South Carolina’s Main Street.”
Cyclists will be able to ride their bikes in green lanes that run alongside the sidewalk, separated from motorists by landscaping and from pedestrians by a row of streetlights.
That design, which keeps bicyclists out of the road and therefore in less danger than usual bike lanes, is a first of its kind in the state, according to the agency.
South Main Street links the University of South Carolina to the Statehouse, making it a busy route for students as well as legislators, their staff and visitors to the Statehouse, said Department of Transportation Director Justin Powell.
The makeover “makes this area even safer for our visitors and our residents here while keeping it beautiful,” Powell said.
The funding came from a combination of state, county, city and federal funds, he said. The Department of Transportation did not provide a breakdown of funding sources.
The transportation department also recently completed work on Harden Street, the main corridor running through Columbia’s Five Points, another popular spot for college students.
That $12 million project similarly reduced lanes for cars from four to two, added landscaped medians to prevent jaywalking and added crosswalks that give pedestrians several more seconds to cross before the lights turn green.

A 2020 Department of Transportation study found that road to be among the most dangerous in South Carolina for cyclists and pedestrians.
That problem, addressed through the improvements, was unacceptable for an iconic part of the state, said Rose, who represents that part of Columbia. Funding for it included an $800,000 earmark in the state budget that he sponsored.
With the new improvements in place, he hopes to be able to send his 14-year-old son to get ice cream without worrying he’ll be hit by a car or see elderly couples window shopping without trouble getting around, he said.
“This is about pedestrian safety,” Rose said. “This is about a historic village. This is about community.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4180-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 12:21:48.758724

Janet Mills has opted to postpone her decisions on 61 bills that the Maine Legislature passed this year until lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Among these bills are proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer.  
With the Legislature adjourned between its two-year session and the ten-day window after lawmakers concluded work now passed, Mills can either veto these bills within the first three days of the next session or allow them to become law without her signature after that. 
“The Legislature passed a significant number of bills at the end of session, and the governor takes seriously her Constitutional obligation to thoroughly review all of them and to evaluate their implications on Maine people, Maine businesses, and the Maine economy,” Mills’ press secretary Ben Goodman said in a statement. “In order to meet that responsibility, she will continue to review these bills and gather more information, and she looks forward to acting on them at the beginning of the next legislative session.”
The Legislature also has the option to recall these bills from the governor’s desk, so proposals could still continue to be worked on next year.
Bills that become law after being held would be enacted in the subsequent session, meaning emergency legislation would take effect immediately but regular bills would take effect 90 days after the adjournment of that session. 
The 61 bills being held are in addition to the nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. While some of those bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. That legislation also includes all of the measures that were left on the appropriations and study tables, which had largely passed the full Legislature but needed to still be funded or staffed.  
Some new bills can also be expected to be introduced next year, though any new measures are limited to budgetary matters, legislation from the governor and proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.
More than 500 bills became law this year. Mills vetoed five, all of which were sustained by lawmakers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MillsBudget-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 12:21:48.758724

Multiple courts had blocked the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, which is granted under the 14th Amendment to any infant born on U.S. soil. There is an exception for children born to foreign diplomats. Laplante will stay his ruling for seven days to give the Trump administration time to appeal, according to his written order.

Article Summary

President Trump’s domestic policy bill contains massive cuts in federal Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.
One analysis predicts $48 billion in spending reductions in Illinois over a decade.
The cuts limit states' ability to raise money through provider taxes to fund their share of Medicaid costs.
The cuts also limit the way states use Medicaid to direct additional payments to hospitals.



SPRINGFIELD — Hospital officials in Illinois say they will have to make some difficult decisions in the next few years that could involve laying off staff, cutting back services and even closing some facilities entirely.

That’s the expected result of federal funding cuts built into the recently passed domestic policy bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, a law that will cut federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

A.J. Wilhelmi, CEO of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois that the financial pressures will fall heaviest on hospitals that serve rural areas, where a larger share of the population is covered by Medicaid.

“The hospitals in these communities are already on the brink, based on some of the increases in labor, drug and supply costs coming out of COVID, a continuation of claim denials by payers and relatively flat reimbursement rates,” Wilhelmi said. “So, all of that is creating significant pressures. And when you add these Medicaid cuts to an already challenging situation, we know that there are several hospitals that close because of these changes.”

Enrollment, reimbursement reductions

The new law contains provisions that are expected to reduce the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, particularly in states like Illinois that expanded eligibility for the program under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare.

Those include work requirements for people who enrolled through the expansion as well as requirements that they verify their continued eligibility for the program twice a year instead of annually.

But the law also includes changes in aspects of the program that most people outside the health care industry never see. Those mechanisms – known as provider taxes and directed payments – affect the way states finance their share of the cost of Medicaid and the way they direct additional payments to certain health care providers such as hospitals.

Like many states, Illinois levies special taxes on certain health care providers, including hospitals. The money those taxes generate is used to draw down additional federal matching funds, then is paid back to the providers in the form of directed payments to increase their overall reimbursement rate and to reward them if they meet certain performance or quality standards.

Currently, IHA estimates the hospital tax generates about $2 billion a year in revenue. This past session, lawmakers passed a bill to increase the assessment in order to fund a 54% increase in hospital payments, subject to federal approval of the state’s plan. But state lawmakers passed that bill before Congress passed Trump’s domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Prior to passage of the new federal law, the tax rate states could levy was effectively capped at 6% of a hospital’s net patient revenue. But under the new law, for states like Illinois that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, that cap will gradually be lowered by half a percentage point each year starting in 2028 until it reaches 3.5% in 2032.

In addition, Wilhelmi said, the new law imposes a cap on the directed payments that expansion states like Illinois can send to hospitals so that the total does not exceed the maximum allowed under Medicare – the federal health insurance program for seniors, which has a lower reimbursement rate than Medicaid.

“And that will result in a significant reduction in Medicaid reimbursements for hospitals,” Wilhelmi said. “It means literally hundreds of millions of dollars in less reimbursement to hospitals.”

$48 billion impact over 10 years

According to the nonpartisan health policy research organization KFF, federal Medicaid spending in Illinois is expected to be reduced by about $48 billion over 10 years under  the new legislation. That includes an estimated $6.73 billion in spending cuts in rural parts of the state.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has been harshly critical of the new law, and particularly the Medicaid cuts contained in it.

“Donald Trump isn't just cutting health care — he's also closing hospitals in Illinois and across the country with his latest scheme,” Pritzker said in one social media post while the bill was moving through Congress. “Hard-working Illinoisans will spend more time in overcrowded waiting rooms and lose access to life-saving care.”

Wilhelmi, meanwhile, said there is still time before the cuts  begin to take effect, and he is urging state officials to begin work immediately to develop strategies to adapt to the changes.

“I think the state will need to work with stakeholders like IHA and our hospitals, other provider groups, to identify creative options to ensure that the Medicaid program can continue to be that lifeline for vulnerable patients and communities,” he said. “And that will include identifying options to fortify those programs and services, as well as identify working with our congressional delegation on ways to mitigate or further delay these changes.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico hospital advocates and officials are still determining the impacts from the federal budget bill recently signed by President Donald Trump, but warn that losses of potentially billions of dollars in federal funds will hurt the whole system. 
The bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the joint federal and state program to help cover medical costs for some people with lower incomes.
Per capita, New Mexico has the largest share of the population on Medicaid in the country, with more than 830,000 people enrolled—approximately 40% of the state—just under half of whom are children.
New Mexico Health Care Authority officials are seeking clarity from federal officials on the rollout of the law, according to agency spokesperson Marina Piña.
https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/23/new-mexico-hospitals-and-patients-face-closure-from-domino-effect-of-potential-medicaid-cuts/
Congress’ 11th-hour proposition creating a $50 billion dollar fund to soften the impact to rural hospitals, for example, might only delay by a few years predicted program cuts or hospital closures in New Mexico, New Mexico Hospital Association CEO Troy Clark told Source NM.
It’s also unclear to what degree New Mexico would qualify for those funds, Clark said, noting more direction will be needed from federal officials. The association, which lobbies on behalf of New Mexico’s hospitals, also is waiting to understand when cuts may go fully into effect.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty all around. I would guess the implementation of the various aspects of the law could really swing things very differently for us,” Clark said.
In 2024, the state enacted a provider tax on hospitals during the legislative session in order to provide further state funds to match federal dollars. The Healthcare Delivery and Access Act has generated approximately $1.5 billion dollars, Clark said, which offered the opportunities to expand hospital services. Under the Republican-backed federal tax and spending bill, New Mexico — like others — will lose that funding. 
https://stateline.org/2025/07/07/states-scramble-to-shield-hospitals-from-gop-medicaid-cuts/
The uncertainty about the depth of the cuts is preventing hospitals from hiring additional staff for new programs and may result, Clark said, with hospitals cutting staff in intensive care units and labor and delivery services — which require high costs, specialized expertise and may have low volumes in smaller hospitals.
If fully in effect, Clark said the  bill’s impacts will worsen New Mexico’s shortage of providers and widen care gaps.
“It will make things more difficult for us to even maintain the access we have, let alone improve it.” Clark said in an interview with Source NM. “We’re already in an access crisis — we can’t afford to lose one doctor.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Troy-Clark-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 12:21:48.758724

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)House Bill 805, a bill passed in the North Carolina General Assembly and vetoed by Governor Stein this past week, was originally a bill intended to prevent adults and minors from being sexually exploited online. It passed the state House 113-0. Unfortunately, as the bill made its way through the state Senate, it was amended by Republican members to include provisions that target the rights of transgender people and, in effect, seek to deny their existence.
The amended bill is one of scores of similar proposals across the country that have taken flight in recent months. According to the trans legislative tracker that lists data related to anti-trans legislation, there are currently 946 anti-trans bills in 49 states across the country, with 118 having been passed.
As a licensed clinical social worker who has worked in the mental health field for over the last 13 years, with a special focus on treating and uplifting the LGBTQ+ community, I have been following this and other similar bills in recent months. And as grateful as I have been to be able to provide the space my clients need for support and healing, it has been devastating to see the impacts of anti-trans beliefs and anti-trans legislation on those who identify as transgender and gender non-confirming.
My passion for this work began in 2011 during my job as a Therapeutic Mentor, which was my first position in mental health. I provided one-on-one support to youth, helping them develop valuable life skills as a part of an in-home therapy team. My very first client was an adolescent transgender male who was severely depressed and engaging in self-harm.
The goal of in-home therapy is to treat the family dynamic and create a cohesive and supportive environment for the identified client. The reason my client and his parents were receiving our support was due to his parents’ refusal to accept and affirm his gender identity, leading my client to feel that he was unlovable and unworthy as his true, authentic self. My client coped with this by masking his emotional pain with physical pain and contemplating suicide as an option to end that emotional pain.
That case was, unfortunately, one of thousands of similar cases across the country. A survey of LGBTQ+ young people in North Carolina by the Trevor Noah Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention and crisis intervention for LGBTQ+ youth country-wide, found that 41% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered suicide in the past year, including 47% of transgender and non-binary youth.
Recently, I spoke with Niccolo Roditti, the co-director of the LGBTQ+ Youth Center of Durham, to learn more about what the youth here in North Carolina say and feel about the anti-trans legislation across the country. He stated, “They are aware of the anti-LGBTQ+ bills, and it makes them feel not human. It makes them feel their existence only matters if it is at the forefront of a political debate.”
I do not believe that most lawmakers who support these kinds of bills have the intention of harming trans youth or even of simply not caring about their impact. Unfortunately, however, they have allowed themselves to be drawn into a coordinated and cynical national attack on the trans community led by the Trump administration and its right-wing allies that is, at once, premised on a false and simplistic narrative and extremely successful at eliciting the intense fear and bigotry. And their “success” is ultimately rooted in a widespread lack of education and understanding about what it means to be transgender.
As is the case with so many modern policy debates, defenders of trans people and their rights face an uphill battle in seeking to overcome unreasoning fear with science and facts. Our cause does not lend itself as easily to simple mottos and talking points. And so it is that we must continue to educate all Americans.
People must be made aware that gender identity is entirely separate from biological sex due to its many psychological and sociological factors. And they must be informed of what gender dysphoria is and learn that things like fear of rejection, stigma, and internalized homophobia are among the factors that contribute to the “clinically significant distress” necessary in order to receive such a diagnosis.
And the public must also learn about and come to appreciate the crucial need for access to gender affirming care, since it significantly decreases suicidality amongst transgender youth.
During Wake County Senator Terence Everitt’s passionate plea for the Senate to reject the anti-trans amendments and return HB 805 back to its original version, he came as close as anyone has to succinctly summing up the misguided nature of such legislation. “Trans people just want to be left alone,” he said. “That’s all they want.”
If, however, we are to get to the point at which a majority of North Carolinians and their elected leaders grasp this simple truth and reject the hate and misinformation that currently predominate, it’s essential that caring and thinking people redouble their efforts to educate their friends, families and neighbors about these issues and share their lived experiences.

As the United States approaches its 250th anniversary, six cultural and historical organizations across Delaware have been awarded a total of $34,445 in state grants to support programming tied to the Semiquincentennial in 2026.
“We’re officially less than a year out from the 250th anniversary of both Delaware and the nation,” said Margaret Hughes, director of Delaware 250. “It’s very exciting to see and be able to support the fantastic programming being planned by organizations all across the state.”
The funding, announced Wednesday by Delaware 250, is part of a quarterly grant program aimed at helping local museums, historic sites, and nonprofits develop educational and commemorative projects for the milestone year.
Delaware 250 also coincides with the First State’s own 250th anniversary of statehood.
With this latest round, the program has now distributed more than $313,000 to 40 organizations statewide.
“As these grant recipients demonstrate, there are so many ways to thoughtfully and innovatively honor the 250th in Delaware,” said Dick Carter, chair of the Delaware Heritage Commission. “It’s wonderful to see the statewide enthusiasm building as we launch the year leading up to this historic anniversary.”
The spring 2025 grant recipients are:

Coastal Concerts ($5,400), for a Jazz Era musical performance in Lewes that connects local and national history.
Delaware Museum of Nature and Science ($3,470), for an exhibit called “Revolutionary Stories and Evolutionary Specimens” highlighting Delaware state symbols and their ties to local historical figures.
Duck Creek Historical Society ($6,375), to install interpretive signage documenting Smyrna’s history.
Old Swedes Church / Holy Trinity ($7,500), for restoration of 12 Revolutionary War graves and a self-guided tour.
Rehoboth Art League ($4,500), for a juried exhibit, “Art as Revolution,” exploring the power of art in social change, and a historical showcase of the Art League’s legacy.
Rockwood Park and Museum ($7,200), to support “We, the People,” an art exhibit pairing contemporary works with historical portraiture.

Stephen Marz, Delaware’s State Archivist and Director of the Public Archives, said the grants are an opportunity for both residents and visitors to engage more deeply with the state’s heritage.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


As of Dec. 31, 2023, just 16 states and the District of Columbia required gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

The report says Mississippi collected around $64.3 million, or .83%, less than it did the last fiscal year. Last year, the state collected around $7.7 billion, while it collected $7.64 billion this year.
The main reason the state is taking in less money than it did last year is that it collected $232.5 million, or 24%, less from corporate income taxes than it did last year. The state collected more sales taxes, individual income taxes and use taxes than last year. 
Despite the slump in revenue, state government is still living within its means and is collecting more than lawmakers who set the state budget had estimated. 
The Joint Legislative Budget Committee, a group of 14 lawmakers, had estimated that Mississippi would collect $7.6 billion in taxes. Since the state had a lower estimate, it collected $41 million more than it projected. 
Even with the low $7.6 billion estimate, the Legislature during a May special session voted to adopt an even lower $7.1 billion state budget, meaning it left around half a billion dollars unencumbered. 
Still, the fact that the state is receiving less money could be an early sign of recession, or that massive tax cuts passed in recent years and still being phased in are not stimulating economic growth like proponents of the cuts hoped.
Mississippi is continuing a years-long phase out of its franchise tax, which is part of the corporate income tax, and has been cutting its individual income tax. The franchise tax will be eliminated in the next few years, and the already low individual income tax will be phased out over more than a decade. 
Over the last few years, the state has seen increased revenue and lawmakers have increased spending, largely due to unprecedented federal spending and handouts to states for economic stimulus and recovery from the global pandemic. The new Trump administration in Washington is working to cut federal spending and in some cases rescind money already allocated to states.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Republicans are all in a huff this week over a legal bill incurred by Gov. Tim Walz’s office as he prepared for the phony, demagogic congressional hearing on “sanctuary” states that treat immigrants like human beings with rights. 
As the Star Tribune first reported, the bill came to $430,000 between April and mid-June, when Walz appeared before Congress. 
Here’s what Walz, a former congressman, said about it Wednesday: “Yes, it’s expensive. (The congressional hearing) was unnecessary. We are not a sanctuary state. I certainly sat through eight hours and answered all of their questions.” 
He continued: “So yes, it’s ridiculous. It’s why we asked them to allow us not to have to be there. Certainly I would tell you what. It’s not where I wanted to spend money, it’s not where I wanted to spend my time. And it certainly proved that there was nothing there other than using it as grandstanding.”
Walz had sought the assistance of the state’s chief legal officer, Attorney General Keith Ellison, but the AG’s office recommended Walz find outside counsel that specializes in the kind of Punch and Judy show usually on offer from congressional hearings.
So they hired K&L Gates — formerly Preston Gates & Ellis — to prep for the roughly seven-hour hearing, which also included Walz’s fellow Democrats Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. 
Admittedly, that’s some expensive prep: $61,428 for every hour of the congressional hearing. 
OK, sure, that seems like a lot of money, but let’s do some more math. 
The bill for the month of May was $232,000 at an average rate of about $516 an hour, the Strib reported, citing an invoice. 
What’s missing from the Star Tribune report is the next calculation: 
At $516 per hour, that’s roughly 450 hours in May alone! To prepare for a seven-hour congressional hearing. (Walz says it was eight.)
Translation: These fancy D.C. lawyers were working really hard for the people of Minnesota. 
Another calculation: 450 billable hours is 24 hours per day, for 18.75 days. 
Or about 110 hours per week, during the month of May. 
Am I glad that I never went to law school — when do they eat or sleep?!
Apparently, we’re not the only ones privileged to pay for the services of hardworking D.C. lawyers.
The office of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu told the Boston Globe that they expected to pay up to $650,000 to the firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, at $950 per hour, to prepare the mayor for what the Globe called a “widely lauded” and “defiant” appearance before Congress in March. (You get what you pay for!) The work also included the “committee’s investigation into Boston’s immigration policies, and the preparation of documents requested by the committee.”
Either way, I sure hope these lawyers finally get some time off to enjoy the beach houses that Minnesotans are helping to pay for.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/walzpritzkerhochul-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 11:21:45.995151

Laura Kelly's policy prohibiting gender identity discrimination in contracting. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas State Board of Education and Attorney General Kris Kobach have been fighting about whether Kansas should drop a ban on discrimination against persons based on sexual orientation or gender identity from public school district contracts tied to federally funded food nutrition programs.
Kobach asserted the language of some contracts was inconsistent with executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in January, while the state Board of Education said anti-discrimination provisions in contracts for goods or services complied with an executive order issued by Gov. Laura Kelly in 2019.
On July 3, representatives of the state Board of Education met with Kobach to inform the attorney general the text of contracts had to be “made or approved” by the Kansas Department of Administration rather than the state Board of Education or the Kansas State Department of Education.
Kobach’s reply was to reiterate his opinion that non-discrimination language related to gender identity or sexual orientation wasn’t allowed in contracts affixed to federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He urged Kansas education officials to require deletion of offending passages from contracts with public school districts participating in USDA food nutrition programs.
“I remain convinced that school districts have the legal right to refuse the inclusion of language referring to ‘sexual orientation, gender identity or expression’ in their contracts,” Kobach said. “Whether these contracts are categorized internally as ‘state’ or ‘federal’ contracts, if any of the funding for these contracts originated from the federal government, they must be consistent with federal law going forward.”
Kelly’s Executive Order No. 19-02 declared Kansas state government was committed to employment practices that prevented discrimination or harassment on account of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression as well as race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, military or veteran status, disability status, marital or family status, genetic information or political affiliation.
“In a perfect world, we wouldn’t need executive orders like this,” Kelly said at the time she signed the order in 2019. “It’s important that, until we become a perfect world, that we make sure that we’ve got the kinds of things in place that move it towards perfection.”
Kobach said the governor’s six-year-old directive was eclipsed Jan. 20 when Trump signed Executive Orders 14173, 14151  and 14168.
Trump’s orders said federal agencies were forbidden from taking part in “dangerous, demeaning and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.'” Trump’s orders also sought to reject the concept of gender identity and to prevent federal funds from being “used to promote gender ideology.”
In addition, Kobach pointed to an injunction issued in Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education forbidding then-President Joe Biden to establish gender identity as a protected category in Title IX. In July 2024, U.S. District Judge John Broomes of Kansas, who is a Trump appointee, blocked in four states enforcement of Biden’s rule expanding anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ students.
“A refusal by the Kansas Department of Administration to disburse funds, based on the absence of the (Kelly-mandated nondiscrimination) language … would be inconsistent with federal law and may risk federal funding for Kansas school children going forward,” Kobach said.
On Wednesday, the state Department of Education issued a statement that said collaboration continued with Kansas schools “toward a satisfactory resolution” of the conflict.
The dispute was initiated in June when Kobach contacted the state Board of Education to request removal of anti-discrimination language from contracts associated with USDA funding. That led to the July 3 meeting with the attorney general and representatives of the governor’s office, state Department of Administration, state Department of Education and state Board of Education.
“During that meeting, representatives of KSDE and the state board explained that the agencies are bound by state procurement laws and policies,” the state Department of Education statement said.
In late June, Kobach separately requested the U.S. Department of Education investigate four Kansas school districts for potentially failing to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA.
Kobach said the Topeka, Olathe, Shawnee Mission and Kansas City, Kansas, school districts had “harmful and illegal” policies allowing or requiring teachers to conceal from parents information concerning social transitioning of children.
“That a Kansas school district would so cavalierly act to hide such information from parents is shockingly irresponsible,” Kobach said.
Meanwhile, the Kansas Court of Appeals in mid-June reversed a district court decision blocking Kansas officials from complying with requests from individuals to change gender markers on their driver’s licenses. Kobach had filed a lawsuit in 2023 to stop transgender people from changing gender information on licenses.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kobach-at-kbi-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 11:21:45.995151

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A new law review article argues that South Dakota Republican legislators have spent the past eight years systematically weakening the public’s ability to enact laws through ballot questions, a right enshrined in the state constitution since 1898.
“Republican supermajorities in Pierre have repeatedly proposed and passed legislation making it harder for citizen ballot committees to do their work,” the authors wrote. 
The article, published in the South Dakota Law Review, was written by Democratic activist Cory Heidelberger, University of South Dakota law school student Teagan McNary, and Augustana University professor and Democratic former state Sen. Reynold Nesiba. 
The authors identified 33 legislative actions passed from 2017 through 2024 that altered the way citizens may draft, submit or campaign for ballot questions. The authors argue that 14 of those laws pose serious obstacles to direct democracy and were crafted by Republican legislators who are hostile to citizen-led change.
The authors also analyzed recent court rulings that have blocked or overturned several of the laws, citing constitutional violations. Still, they conclude that the overall effect of the legislative push has been to “chill participation in direct democracy.”

Multiple Republicans in leadership positions declined to comment about the article, but Republican Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said he enjoyed reading it. 
“Although it really reads as an advocacy piece from authors with a particular perspective,” he said, “I thought the entire law review issue was good and offered a number of perspectives on different aspects of the legislative process.”
Other articles in the special legislative issue include a look back on the state’s last 100 legislative sessions co-authored by Venhuizen, an assessment of government transparency, and an analysis of how state constitutions impact tribal relations, among other topics.
A legacy under pressure
South Dakota was the first state in the nation to adopt the initiative and referendum process 127 years ago, a legacy of the populist and progressive movements that sought to reduce corporate influence over state governments, the authors explain. An initiative puts a proposed law on the ballot, and a referendum sends a legislatively adopted law to the ballot for voters’ approval or rejection. Both require thousands of petition signatures from registered voters to earn a place on the ballot.
Citizen-backed ballot questions have been used in South Dakota to raise the minimum wage (2014), cap “payday lending” at 36% interest (2016), legalize medical marijuana (2020) and expand Medicaid eligibility (2022). All that recent history, the authors argue, has triggered a backlash from Republican lawmakers in Pierre.
Republican SD lawmakers pursue a multifaceted crackdown on citizen-backed ballot measures

The article outlines a series of legislative changes in South Dakota that, according to authors, have made it harder for citizens to pass laws through the ballot initiative process. A 2017 law delayed implementing voter-approved measures until the following July, giving lawmakers more time to amend or repeal them. In 2018, the Legislature passed a law requiring initiatives be about one subject, which opponents argue makes it easier to challenge them in court. Last year, a new law allowed voters to withdraw their signatures from petitions.
Additional bills were passed during this year’s legislative session. One moved the deadline for filing ballot measure petition signatures from May up to February, shortening the time available for signature collection. That law is being challenged in court. Lawmakers also sent their own ballot question to voters next year that will ask them to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendment ballot questions from a simple majority to 60% of votes cast.
The authors close the article with several recommendations, including increasing staffing at the Legislative Research Council to improve ballot measure processing, and repealing laws that burden circulators or discourage volunteerism.
“Opponents of initiative and referendum (most of them legislators who rightly perceive direct democracy as a check on their power) like to cry ‘We’re a Republic, not a Democracy!’ But we are and can be both,” the authors wrote.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/591A8285-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 11:21:45.995151

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

You might want to buy sooner rather than later. Federal tax credits on EVs will end September 30.,"If you’re thinking about buying an electric vehicle, you might want to buy sooner rather than later.
Federal tax credits on electric vehicles, which were set to expire in 2032, will now end on September 30 under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The credits offer buyers up to $7,500 off new EVs and up to $4,000 off used EVs.
Barry Kresch is the president of the Electric Vehicle Club of Connecticut. Those savings were a big help in making the price of EVs more competitive with gas cars, he said.
“People know intellectually that it’s less expensive to own an EV,” Kresch said.
“Charging a vehicle is less expensive than buying gas. They have 90% fewer parts and so they need less maintenance,” he said. “But that sticker price was still a barrier and people were hesitant to spend an additional $5,000 to $7,000 on an EV that was comparable to the kind of gas vehicle they might have purchased.”
According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price for a new EV is about $9,000 more than a gas car.
Before the federal tax credits expire, Kresch expects a surge in EV purchases, followed by an eventual decline, with negative consequences for the environment.
“There’s nothing good about burning fossil fuels,” Kresch said. “This will exacerbate global warming and it will worsen public health in terms of additional cases of cardiopulmonary diseases and cancer.”
But while the federal credits are going away, purchasers of an EV in Connecticut could still see some relief.
That’s because the state has its own rebate program known as the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate or CHEAPR.
It offers $1,500 to $5,000 off battery electric vehicles and $750 to $3,000 off plug-in hybrids. Those rebates will not be affected by the federal cuts, state officials said.

As a result of the settlement, Chesapeake residential home heating customers will see a rate increase of 6% and non-heating customers will see a rate increase of 6.5%.
For an average residential home heating customer, this will result in an increase of approximately $5.37 per month, and for an average residential non-heating customer, an increase of approximately $2.74 per month.

Chesapeake filed its rate case on August 12, 2024, initially seeking an increase in its revenue of $12.1 million, raising the requested increase to $12.8 million in later filings.
Chesapeake’s rate case was its first request to increase base gas rates in nine years.
Through the settlement, the amount of the overall rate increase was reduced from Chesapeake’s initial request of $12.1 million to a final settlement of $6.1 million, lowering the impact of the rate increase on Chesapeake customers.
“We know every dollar counts for Delaware families, so we pushed to cut Chesapeake’s original request by half,” said Jameson Tweedie, Delaware Public Advocate. “This agreement keeps monthly fixed charges the same and helps limit the impact on customer bills.”
The settlement also ensures there will be no increases to monthly fixed customer charges or miscellaneous charges by Chesapeake.
This settlement is the result of extensive negotiations between the Division of the Public Advocate, staff for the PSC, and Chesapeake and reflects a mutual balancing of various issues and positions.
Chesapeake implemented interim rates on May 1, 2025, that match the settlement amount.

Stebbins/Michigan Advance)Battle Creek, Michigan-based WK Kellogg, maker of Kellogg’s cereal brands and other breakfast foods, could soon be owned by Italian chocolate maker Ferrero – a $3 billion deal that could be finalized as soon as this week.
News of the deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, and shares in the company rose more than 50% after the story was published on Wednesday, CNBC reported.
The company’s potential sale could mean further consolidation of the packaged foods market, due mostly to market pressures caused by inflation and consumers moving to healthier breakfast foods over sugary cereals.
BenWK Kellogg recently split into two, becoming a standalone company – WK Kellogg Co – in 2023, while the other venture was renamed as Kellanova, which oversees production of brands like Pringles and Cheez-It.
CNBC also reported that Mars, maker of M&M and other staple chocolate brands, agreed to purchase Kellanova last year, but the deal has not been finalized.
Ferrero’s move to purchase WK Kellogg would mark the company’s wider effort to grow in the U.S. market, as it is already the third-largest candy company in the nation.
Kellogg shareholders would still need to sign off on the deal, which is expected. It’s unknown how the deal would affect the approximately 700 Michigan employees of the company.

(Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by  President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

A program focused on helping adults obtain a high school diploma graduated 29 students in this year’s class graduation in late June.
The Sussex Tech Adult Education Division, part of Sussex County Vocational Technical School District, offers the program to enhance people’s lives and careers.
The GED (General Educational Development) program is for adults who do not have a high school diploma. Students earn the GED credential by passing 4 tests: Math, Science, Social Studies, and Reading Language Arts.
The GED credential is accepted for admittance into many colleges and the military.
“After having only a fifth grade education and being removed from my home by the state at 17, I decided to pursue and finish my education which was one of my dreams as I was very limited all my life due to this setback,” said Micah Miller, one of the graduates.
After he completed my GED, he said he felt very accomplished and having the diploma opened up many more job opportunities so he would not be stuck on minimum wage jobs all his life.
“It also opened the door for me to be able to apply and be excepted into college where I’m working on my degree to one day become a teacher,” he said.

Now in its sixth decade, the program continues to offer a wide array of affordable courses and certifications designed to meet the evolving needs of the community.
From earning a high school diploma through the James H. Groves Adult High School to gaining technical certifications in high-demand fields, Sussex Tech Adult Education provides flexible options for adult learners.
Programs include instruction in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), basic and advanced computer literacy, and high school diploma preparation.
The division also offers skilled training programs in health care and other trades, including apprenticeships in auto mechanics, CDL-A, electrical trades, HVAC-R, and welding.
These courses are designed to prepare participants for entry into new professions or help them upskill for advancement in their current roles.
Driver education courses and customized workforce training programs for businesses are also part of Sussex Tech’s offerings. The school’s workforce development team can tailor training to meet specific business needs, with the flexibility to deliver instruction either on-site or at the Career Training Center in Georgetown.
“The GED is an alternative option for adults to earn their secondary credential,” said Kelly Whaley, director of Adult Education at the district. “Earning the GED opens doors to post-secondary programs and better paying jobs that allow adults to support their families and make a better life for themselves.”
It’s a self-paced program, where some students move through within a year, and some take longer.

Enrollment has increased significantly over the last 5 years, and the program has had as many as 50 students earn a GED in one year.

It’s usually around 30 in the program, and it enrollees can choose between day and evening classes throughout Sussex County in order to fit their schedule.
Ashley Cooper, another grad, contextualized the importance of the program and how it helps people who’ve experienced some obstacles in life.
“For a long time, life had its own plans,” she said in her graduation speech. “I faced challenges that forced me to put my education on hold. But even when I stepped away from the classroom, I never let go of the belief that I could do more. That I would do more. And that belief only grew stronger when I became a parent.”
Having her son changed everything, she said, as he gave Cooper a new reason to rise every morning with purpose.
“I realized that if I wanted to show him the value of hard work, perseverance, and self-respect, I needed to lead by example,” she said. “I couldn’t just tell him to chase his dreams—I had to show him how to fight for them, even when the odds aren’t in your favor.”
That’s why she made the choice to go back and get her GED.
“Because I believe education is one of the most powerful tools we have to shape our future,” she said. “It’s the key that can open doors I once thought were locked forever. I didn’t go back to school just to earn a piece of paper—I did it to prove to myself and to my son that it’s never too late to rewrite your story.”
This journey hasn’t been easy, she emphasized, with balancing work, parenting, and studying taking everything she has.
But, she said she’s learned that strength doesn’t come from things being easy, but rather from doing what’s hard, and doing it anyway.
“To anyone who has ever felt like they missed their chance—I’m here to tell you: your chance is still here,” she said. “I’m living proof of that. This isn’t just about me earning my GED. It’s about building a foundation for something greater—for college, for a career, for a stable and proud future. Most of all, it’s about making sure my son grows up knowing that his mother never gave up—and neither should he.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-e1752155307151.jpg,,,2025-07-10 10:11:35.749183

Massachusetts’ 2024 climate law aims to hasten the clean energy transition to meet the state’s climate goals, but a dispute over whether natural gas utility companies have an “obligation to serve” natural gas could stall the transition off of fossil-fuel infrastructure.  
The post In enforcing new climate law, a dispute over the ‘obligation to serve’ natura[...]","FOR DECADES, NATURAL gas utilities in Massachusetts have been required, except in limited circumstances, to provide service to any customer within their service territory who requests it. This so-called “obligation to serve” is now at the center of a high-stakes dispute as the state works to transition away from natural gas for heating, cooking, and powering appliances as part of its climate goals.  
Achieving the state’s ambitious decarbonization targets will require converting some existing gas customers to electric systems. To support this transition, a 2024 climate law changed the longstanding “obligation to serve” to allow the Department of Public Utilities to take into account the state’s emission limits and the presence of alternatives to the gas system when deciding whether to compel a utility company to deliver service to customers. 
But there are clashing views on whether the change allows utility companies to kick off unwilling customers from the natural gas system as part of the clean energy transition, or they are only allowed to deny service to new customers requesting it.  
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, says the 2024 law – which he had a hand in writing – scrapped entirely the companies’ “obligation to serve” natural gas when other alternatives are present, but utility companies insist that the change only applies to new customers seeking service and not existing customers.  
“There is absolutely no distinction made in the old law or the new law between existing customers and new ones,” said Barrett. “If the Senate and then ultimately the Legislature had wanted to distinguish between old and new customers, the Senate and the Legislature would have done so.” 
The utility companies take a different view. All five of the state’s investor-owned natural gas utilities – Eversource, National Grid, Unitil, Berkshire Gas Company, and Liberty – confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon that they believe that they still have an obligation to serve existing natural gas customers.  
“The 2024 climate law did modify certain parameters that apply to the DPU’s consideration of whether a customer has been wrongfully deprived of service, once a customer has brought a complaint to the DPU,” said William Hinkle, a spokesperson for Eversource, in an email. “However, this would not apply to an existing customer.” 
The DPU – which is responsible for making the decision on the issue – has yet to weigh in as it investigates the utility companies’ plans for climate compliance. The agency’s decision will have huge implications for the state’s effort to wean customers off fossil fuels.  
The DPU declined to comment on the issue. 
The agency has required the gas utility companies to submit climate compliance plans in which the companies outline how they plan to align their operations with the state’s climate goals, specifically focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the agency is evaluating those plans. 
Barrett said that the utility companies have historically leaned on “obligation to serve” as an excuse to delay electrification and continue investing in the natural gas system.  
“For years, the gas interest has pointed to the old ‘obligation to serve’ as a reason why they could not move toward electrification,” said Barrett. “Much as they might wish to get off fossil fuels, they would tell us, the ‘obligation to serve’ emerges as a massive impediment to their ability to do the right thing.” 
According to Barrett, the Legislature overall sought to eliminate that impediment by changing the “obligation to serve” in the 2024 law. 
As the state strives to meet its climate goals, environmentalists say that transitioning existing buildings off the gas system needs to happen not just house by house, but block by block. The transition, they say, needs to happen at a larger scale in order to prevent a situation where ratepayers are left paying for both the gas system and the clean energy transition. 
However, if there is an “obligation to serve” existing customers and electrification of a neighborhood has holdouts who want to stay on the gas system, the natural gas system serving the block or neighborhood can’t be retired.  
As part of the climate compliance process, gas utility companies have worked together on a plan to move to alternative forms of energy, like network geothermal, solar, or air-source heat pumps. In their analysis, the companies cite a lack of customer participation as one of the reasons why a larger-scale non-pipeline alternative project might be scrapped or modified. 
Utility companies say they are committed to the energy transition and will evaluate non-pipeline alternatives but, with the “obligation to serve,” electrifying block by block will pose challenges if a small percentage of people aren’t willing to shift off of natural gas.    
If there are neighborhoods where a gas system has to be maintained and a non-pipeline alternative is introduced, ratepayers will end up paying for both, said Caitlin Peale Sloan, vice president for Massachusetts at the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy organization. Eventually, she said, it will be more costly for gas ratepayers because there will be fewer ratepayers to share the costs. This can potentially lead to a scenario where lower-income residents or renters – who are less able to transition to clean energy – are stuck on an increasingly more expensive gas system. 
“In a hopeful, optimistic, ideal world, you could make progress on a vision of an affordable and orderly transition without changing the ‘obligation to serve,’ but it would require every customer along the way to be completely on board,” said Sloan. “That’s probably not the world we live in. There’s a lot of friction, and so we need the ‘obligation to serve’ to reflect the reality of the transition, which I believe the 2024 climate bill did, but the utilities are digging in their heels.”

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in US v. Skrmetti, a case about Tennessee's law banning gender-affirming care for minors and if it violates the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”
The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
Scientific and policy debates
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.

Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
‘Time for a reckoning.’ Kansas farmers brace for water cuts to save Ogallala Aquifer.

In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.
While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

News of the deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, and shares in the company rose more than 50% after the story was published on Wednesday, CNBC reported.
The company’s potential sale could mean further consolidation of the packaged foods market, due mostly to market pressures caused by inflation and consumers moving to healthier breakfast foods over sugary cereals.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
WK Kellogg recently split into two, becoming a standalone company – WK Kellogg Co – in 2023, while the other venture was renamed as Kellanova, which oversees production of brands like Pringles and Cheez-It.
CNBC also reported that Mars, maker of M&M and other staple chocolate brands, agreed to purchase Kellanova last year, but the deal has not been finalized.
Ferrero’s move to purchase WK Kellogg would mark the company’s wider effort to grow in the U.S. market, as it is already the third-largest candy company in the nation. 
Kellogg shareholders would still need to sign off on the deal, which is expected. It’s unknown how the deal would affect the approximately 700 Michigan employees of the company.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC_0033-2-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 10:11:35.749183

The project is intended to upgrade the IT system used by the House and Senate to craft legislation. The expectation is to implement the new program before start of the 2026 session in January. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican and Democrats in the Kansas Legislature expressed frustration with inability of a software developer to hit the June 30 deadline for completing work on modernized software for processing bills, amendments and resolutions.
The Legislative Coordinating Council, comprised of the state’s top legislative leaders, signed a $3.9 million contract with Propylon in October 2022 to overhaul the computer system essential to drafting and tweaking legislation. In December, an IT steering committee thought it was reasonable to assume Propylon would have made enough progress to deploy the new system by the end of June.
Persistent bugs in the software prompted the LCC’s vote this week to postpone the launch until Oct. 1. The three-month extension to address problems would come at an estimated cost of $190,000, legislative officials said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said he wouldn’t be surprised if Propylon was unable to comply with the revised deadline. The plan was to thoroughly integrate the new system long before start of the 2026 legislative session in January.
“My frustration is the Eveready bunny called Propylon,” Hawkins said. “It just keeps going and going and going. When does it stop? Right now, it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we got to January 1 and we don’t go live simply because Propylon doesn’t seem to deliver on their promises.”
The Legislature has worked with Propylon on IT projects since 2011. The company’s work on the Kansas Legislative Information System and Services, or KLISS, has generated controversy for years as other states adopted increasingly sophisticated programs to write legislation.
Operational problems with Kansas’ current version of KLISS has periodically brought the House and Senate to a standstill. There have been conversations among legislators about switching to one of Propylon’s software competitors, but the LCC stuck with Propylon.
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, R-Wichita, said a functional software system was crucial to the daily operation of the Legislature.
“It’s been three years,” he said, “and we’re missing a deadline again.”
“We keep punting this,” said Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat. “We do need to move forward, but I don’t believe we’re getting what we need from them.”
Gordon Self, who leads the Legislature’s office of the revisor of statutes, is a member of the KLISS project steering committee responsible for monitoring work on the system update. He said testing of Propylon’s new software revealed flaws and warranted the postponement.
“We did not feel the system was production ready,” Self said.
Self said the original three-year timeline established in the Propylon contract was ambitious. A four-year schedule would have been reasonable, he said.
He said many users of Kansas’ existing bill-writing software were interested in making the system faster. In his role as leader of the division dedicated to writing legislation, Self said his focus was on accuracy.
“I won’t take a system into usage that isn’t ready,” Self told legislators. “I’m an optimist, but I’m also a realist. If we don’t get what we need in a timely fashion, we will be back here to discuss other alternatives.”
Tom Day, director of the Legislature’s administrative services division, said he was confident Propylon would have session-ready software by Oct. 1. He acknowledged testing continued to identify defects in the new KLISS software.
“We fix some and then when we get into an almost production-type environment, others pop up,” Day said.
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said it was risky to give Propylon until October to address weaknesses in the software. He said a revised deadline of Aug. 15 or Sept. 1 would be more appropriate because it would give actual users of the software more time to identify kinks prior to the 2026 session.
“We wait to go live October 1, then you’ve got the Thanksgiving holidays, the Christmas holidays. That doesn’t feel like hardly enough time to have a real-live test,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gordon-Self-COGE-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 10:11:35.749183

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Congressional Republicans target tax that provides billions to Missouri Medicaid program

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

The island, now part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, was the site of atomic weapons tests in 1965, 1969 and 1971. (Photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)People who might have been exposed to radiation from atomic weapons tests conducted in the Aleutians half a century ago have extra time to apply for compensation from a federal program, under the sweeping tax and budget bill passed by Congress and signed into law last week.
The bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, includes a provision reviving the Radiation Compensation Exposure Act, which was enacted in 1990.
The act’s compensation system distributed one-time payments to people who were exposed to radiation from the weapons tests and who later were diagnosed with certain types of cancer. The program has distributed about $2.7 billion to date, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
While most of the tests covered by the act were conducted in Nevada, the program also covers health damages from underground weapons tests conducted on Alaska’s Amchitka Island in 1965, 1969 and 1971.
The program covers former uranium mine workers, as well, many of whom were Navajo Nation members.
The compensation program had been on track to expire, with a previous deadline of June 10, 2024, for any new claims.
The budget bill extends the deadline for new claims to Dec. 31, 2027, and it sets a Dec. 31, 2028, sunset date for the trust fund that administers the claims.
The bill also raises compensation amounts. For “downwinders,” people who were not on site at the time of the tests but may have been exposed to radiation carried by the wind, the compensation is hiked from $50,000 to $100,000. For on-site workers, the compensation is raised from $75,000 to $100,000.
Of the Alaska weapons tests, the third — called Cannikin — was the most controversial.
It was the biggest underground nuclear test ever conducted by the United States. The tested bomb was 5 megatons, about 250 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. There was widespread opposition to the project, including from environmentalists who later founded the organization Greenpeace.
Legal opposition to the test went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately allowed the project to proceed.
The test created what was the equivalent of a magnitude 7 earthquake, killing up to 2,000 sea otters and thousands of fish.
The island continues to undergo environmental monitoring, for which the U.S. Department of Energy is responsible. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, a tribal organization, are partners.

Days after President Donald Trump signed his sweeping budget bill into law last week, a federal judge on Monday issued a temporary injunction to block one of the bill’s provisions to ban Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving federal Medicaid payments.
With 115 clinics across the state and a million Californians using Planned Parenthood each year, the administration’s plan to defund the organization is just one of the many ways its cuts to Medicaid and Medi-Cal — the state’s version of the health insurance program — are anticipated to deeply affect Californians.
As CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra and Kristen Hwang explain, Trump’s new budget guts Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Most of that figure takes the form of new requirements that will kick people off coverage, leaving more people uninsured. With less federal funding for Medi-Cal, the state is expected to lose $28.4 billion and 3.4 million Californians could lose coverage.
Besides California Planned Parenthood clinics standing to lose more than $300 million, new work requirements for Medicaid are expected to take effect by the end of 2026. Adults will be required to report at least 80 hours a month of employment, school or volunteer work. 
This mandate is anticipated to force up to 1.4 million Californians off Medi-Cal within the first year, in part because filing paperwork would be difficult for certain jobs that don’t have regular paychecks or proof-of-employment documentation. 
The 5.5 million children on Medi-Cal are also likely to feel the cuts. The new budget restricts eligibility for the Children’s Health Insurance Program to legal permanent residents — rendering those with temporary legal status, such as visas or refugee status, ineligible. Similar immigration limitations and additional new work requirements imposed on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could also lead to 3.1 million California families losing food stamp assistance.
These cuts were made by Congress and the Trump administration in order to finance permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and give Immigrations and Customs Enforcement more money than most militaries.

A check from State Farm failed to clear for an Altadena resident who lost her home and ranch in the Eaton Fire, and nobody — not even the insurer — knows exactly why, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
On Tuesday Amelia McDonald called her bank, Chase, to ask why the funds from the $876,354.07 check she deposited on June 30 were still not available. The bank, McDonald said, told her it was because State Farm had insufficient funds.
The incident added to what McDonald describes as “a horrible experience” trying to get her claims paid by State Farm. The state’s largest property insurer is currently facing lawsuits related to its handling of smoke-damage claims, prompting the state to open a formal investigation in June.
In an emailed response, a spokesperson for State Farm said that after reviewing the incident, “we see no indication why the bank would not release the funds to our customer.”

McDonald: “I’m an insurance defense attorney. I’ve been working for insurance companies for more than 20 years. I’ve never had a check bounce to a claimant in 25 years of practice.”

Assembly GOP leader passes the torch

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu:
The next leader of the Assembly Republicans vows to put public policy above politics.
Assemblymember Heath Flora, a Ripon agricultural business owner who drew fire from fellow Republicans for working across the aisle, will take the baton from Assembly Republican leader James Gallagher in September. Gallagher, a Chico Republican, will term out in 2026.
Flora, co-chair of the bipartisan legislative “Problem Solvers Caucus,” is a more moderate voice in his caucus who says bipartisan collaboration is necessary to advance GOP goals. He is one of six GOP lawmakers urging Trump to target criminals instead of undocumented workers in immigration raids. As the incoming minority leader, Flora wants the caucus to hone in on affordability issues, instead of cultural fights over issues like transgender rights.

Flora, in an interview with CalMatters: “Building that relationship with our Democratic colleagues, moving good policy forward, is certainly where we are going to stay focused.”

Ibarra and Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/07/federal-budget-health-care-medicaid-medi-cal/,"Lower-income people will be the hardest hit. Over the next 10 years, 3.4 million Californians could lose coverage.","In summary
Lower-income people will be the hardest hit. Over the next 10 years, 3.4 million Californians could lose coverage. 



The new federal budget signed into law by President Donald Trump is expected to raise some health care insurance premiums and force millions off coverage, reverberating the most in lower-income families and communities that are already struggling.
Trump’s new budget reduces spending for Medicaid — called Medi-Cal in California — by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. These savings would happen in part because new requirements will result in people falling off coverage. 
In addition, some people enrolled in Covered California, the state’s marketplace for subsidized health plans, can expect new rules and higher costs, which means more people will be unable to afford the insurance.
Over the next 10 years, the federal changes are estimated to cost the state $28.4 billion and result in 3.4 million Californians losing coverage, according to an estimate from Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials. 
Less federal funding for Medi-Cal means California will have to make decisions on who is covered and which services are offered. That loss of coverage could be a big blow to California, where lawmakers like to boast about having one of the nation’s lowest uninsured rates. 
Alex Rossel, CEO of the community clinic Families Together of Orange County, says as people lose coverage, they’ll get sicker and be left in debt. “All that hard work that clinics have been doing to help people manage their chronic illnesses… is going to be in jeopardy,” he said. 
And the effects of these changes could be felt beyond people enrolled in Medi-Cal and Covered California as clinics and hospitals warn that their financial challenges are likely to be exacerbated. Some may have to reduce services or close their doors.
Here are five things to know about how the new federal budget will affect Californians: 
Some Medi-Cal enrollees will have work requirements and co-pays 
Most notably, the new law requires adults ages 19 to 64 to report at least 80 hours a month of “community engagement,” which could be employment, school or volunteer work.
People who fail to do so will no longer qualify for Medi-Cal. Parents of children 13 and under and people with mental and physical disabilities will be exempt from the work requirements. The new requirement takes effect Dec. 31, 2026, although states could choose to start sooner.
The Urban Institute estimates that this rule alone could force up to 1.4 million Californians off their Medi-Cal insurance in the first year of implementation — not necessarily because they don’t work, but because filing paperwork is likely to pose a challenge for many enrollees. Enrollment counselors say some workers, such as housekeepers and gardeners, don’t have regular paychecks or documentation to prove their employment.
This same group of adults will have to reapply for coverage every six months, instead of once a year. And those who earn more than $15,060 a year, starting in October 2028, may have a co-pay of up to $35 per visit — although the exact amount will be up to states. Some visits will be exempt, such as prenatal and primary care, pediatric care and emergency room visits. (A single adult qualifies for Medi-Cal with an annual income of up to $21,597.) 
Higher premiums for Covered California
One of the most significant changes is by omission: The Republican-led Congress opted to not renew some Affordable Care Act subsidies that will expire at the end of this year.
Nearly 90% of Californians who purchase insurance through Covered California, the state’s Affordable Care Act insurance exchange, receive financial assistance from federal subsidies that help lower monthly premiums.
On average, for all enrollees, premiums are expected to increase by 66%, or $101, per month starting next year. Lower-income people will see the biggest premium increase because they receive more subsidies, said Covered California Executive Director Jessica Altman.
Those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level (about $60,240 per year for an individual) are projected to pay an average of $191 more monthly, according to Covered California data. 
More than 170,000 middle-income enrollees will lose financial assistance entirely. 
Other changes made in Trump’s sweeping budget and policy bill include the elimination of automatic renewal, more income verification requirements and limiting special enrollment periods. The groups most likely to forego coverage because of administrative barriers are those who are young and healthy, Altman said.
Combined, the added enrollment complexities, along with higher out-of-pocket costs, are expected to drive nearly 600,000 Californians off of coverage, according to Covered California projections. 
Hospital cuts could impact everyone
When people lose coverage, they are likely to skip routine care; they wait until they are very sick and then visit an emergency room. And without insurance, most people cannot afford to pay their hospital bills.For hospitals, more uninsured patients means less compensation. The law also adds new restrictions on provider taxes that states levy on hospitals and insurers to draw down matching federal funds to help pay for Medi-Cal. Hospitals receive payments from the revenue generated by these taxes that help them fill the gaps from traditional reimbursement.Rural and community hospitals that care for a large share of low-income patients enrolled in Medi-Cal may have an especially difficult time absorbing the losses, so they may have to cut services, reduce staff or close, hospital leaders say.“Hospitals will be forced to make difficult decisions, and access to vital health care services will be jeopardized for all Californians — not just those who rely on Medi-Cal for their health care coverage,” Carmela Coyle, the president of the California Hospital Association said in a statement. In a recent press briefing, Newsom noted that a number of hospitals in California have been struggling for some time.  In 2023, California rolled out $300 million in interest-free loans to bail out 17 distressed hospitals. The state, currently dealing with a budget deficit, would have a harder time helping hospitals again.“Those distressed hospital loans came at a time of abundance. Those distressed hospital loans came at a time when we had much more stability with state funds and federal funds, and they were 3x the request for support,” Newsom said. 
A funding ban for Planned Parenthood
Effective immediately after Trump signed the bill, Planned Parenthood clinics were banned from receiving federal Medi-Cal payments. Three days later, a federal judge temporarily blocked the funding cut after Planned Parenthood sued. But as the litigation plays out, advocates say the move could be financially devastating to clinics across the country. In California, a million people use Planned Parenthood clinics each year, and Medi-Cal makes up 80% of its patients.Federal law already prohibits the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions except in extremely limited instances. But Planned Parenthood does much more than that for patients. While it’s the largest abortion provider in the state, abortions account for less than 10% of its services. Contraceptives, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment and check ups account for the vast majority of patient visits.California Planned Parenthood clinics stand to lose more than $300 million, jeopardizing their ability to remain open. The national Planned Parenthood association estimates that 200 clinics across two dozen states are at risk of closure.All clinics are open and taking patients, said Jodi Hicks, affiliate CEO and president. But the funding cuts could amount to a de facto abortion ban because in many California communities, Planned Parenthood is the only provider that performs abortions.“People should be angry,” Hicks said. “We will fight back with every tool that we have to ensure that patients are able to be seen at our health centers, but the damage of defunding an entity that has such a large footprint in California is deep.”
Some kids will lose health care and food stamps 
The vast majority of health and social services cuts in the federal budget are aimed at adults, but experts say kids will suffer as well. That’s because many of the changes implemented for adults, like work requirements and more frequent income eligibility checks can impact the eligibility of the entire family.
“There are a lot of ways that kids can fall through the cracks,” said Mike Odeh, senior health policy director for Children Now.
About 5.5 million children in California, half of the state’s youths, use Medi-Cal. The state insurance program also pays for some school-based health services, such as counseling and speech therapy.
One of the biggest health cuts targeting children specifically restricts eligibility for the Children’s Health Insurance Program to legal permanent residents, meaning other immigrant children with temporary legal status such as visas or refugee status could not qualify. California already provides health care for all children regardless of immigration status, but the federal prohibition means the state will have to pay more if it wants to continue covering them.
On top of the Medi-Cal cuts, the budget bill makes significant changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, often referred to as food stamps. It institutes stricter work requirements for many adults including veterans and parents of teenagers, ties future spending to inflation and shifts more of the cost-sharing onto states. Similar to the immigration requirement for children’s Medi-Cal, food stamp eligibility will also be restricted to legal permanent residents.
Newsom’s office estimates that 735,000 people will lose food stamps. Early estimates from the Urban Institute project that 3.1 million California families will lose at least some of their food assistance. About a third of all newborns in California are enrolled in food stamp programs, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/033023-Hollister-Hospital-LV_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

It was a month ago that President Donald Trump unilaterally decided that the city needed National Guard troops to contain anger over his Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to forcibly remove undocumented immigrants from the city.
Since that moment, practically everything about the protests or the federal response to them has lacked a connection to reality. It has largely been a series of orchestrated appearances, drive-by observations and theatrical pronouncements. Relatively few in a city of 4 million people even notice. 
It’s all cosplay, put on for imagery and political advantage.
To take it from the top: On June 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, dressed in their now-familiar villain costumes, swarmed into Los Angeles neighborhoods, claiming to be after the “worst of the worst,” criminal migrants whose presence in the United States threatened our way of life. Strangely, however, ICE went looking for those hardened criminals at Home Depots and car washes, not known as magnets for cartels but rather for hardworking people trying to provide for families.
Immigrant communities responded with shock and anger, and some protested that night outside the federal building in Downtown L.A. It got rowdy, and some demonstrators had to be chased off with tear gas or otherwise dispersed. There were flashes of violence, something on the order of a Laker championship parade that went on too long. By late that night, order had been restored by the Los Angeles Police Department.
The next morning, downtown Los Angeles was peaceful. The March of Dimes held a fair. Diners enjoyed coffee and breakfast at outdoor markets and cafes. The streets were calm and quiet.
President Trump, however, saw an opportunity to call in the Guard, placing California troops under his authority and ordering 2,000 civilian soldiers to Los Angeles over the objections of Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Trump promptly declared victory, saying that the units had restored order to the city. It was peaceful, yes, but not because of anything the federal government did. The guard had not even arrived at that point. 
To the contrary, the arrival of the Guard and then active-duty Marines gave protesters someone to direct their anger at. Over the next several days, demonstrators amassed outside the federal building downtown and engaged in daytime peaceful protests that sometimes turned violent after dark. The images were startling — those of protesters setting fire to driverless taxis were particularly indelible — but the entire saga unfolded in a 5- to 10-square block area of a 470-square mile city.
Neither military unit played a meaningful role in responding to those protests. Soldiers were assigned to protect two buildings: one downtown, the other in Westwood. 
Those must rank as two of the best-protected buildings in the nation.
From the outside, this all looked ominous. Every Angeleno I know got a call from a friend or family member elsewhere asking about the danger. The fact is that the city was almost entirely calm throughout, scenes of violence exaggerated by close-up shots that did not pull back to see a larger, sprawling city at rest. 
This made-for-TV drama continued as elected officials scooped up their moments in the spotlight. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dipped a toe inside the city limits — a dozen miles away from the protests — to host a self-aggrandizing press conference in Westwood, only to have U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla elbow his way in and be thrown to the ground by overzealous FBI agents. That day’s episode supplied images of a sitting senator — a Latino, of course — in handcuffs. 
Not to be outdone, Vice President JD Vance was drawn to the flame of attention, and he made his L.A. cameo with another peek at the city from well outside any of its turbulence. 
His brief episode was made in front of a fire truck and highlighted by his intentional mangling of Padilla’s name — the vice president called a Senate colleague “Jose,” with all the smug, opportunistic racism that has defined Vance’s rise to prominence and Padilla has surely faced on his. Vance then comically dismissed the incident as “political theater.” 
It takes a drama queen to know one.

And so the tragi-comedy of Los Angeles continues. For Bass, the swirl of put-on politics is especially exasperating. 
“I feel like I’m in one of his TV shows,” she said of Trump when we spoke last week. But for her and for Los Angeles, this is not a ratings game. 
“This is an experiment in the seizure of power,” she said, a test of how far politicians and the public are willing to let Trump and his cast of misfit advisers flex their muscles on a city uninterested in hosting them.
A point of comparison offers a reminder of how absurd this is. In 1992, then-Gov. Pete Wilson dispatched the National Guard to Los Angeles. I waited for the Guard to deploy from its staging area in Exposition Park, and when it finally did, its arrival was welcome (a briefer deployment of Marines did not go as well, and they were quickly sent back).
The Guard in 1992 arrived in a city that had melted down: More than 60 people died, 1,000 buildings burned and unrest stretched from City Hall to Hollywood, with whole swaths of South Los Angeles torn to shreds. In that vast explosion of violence, the Guard helped restore order, and most of the troops were withdrawn two weeks later.
This time, roughly 1,850 National Guardsmen remain deployed in Los Angeles more than a month after first arriving on a scene that was already under control. No one has died (one death is under investigation), no buildings have burned. And yet, the soldiers are still here. They do practically nothing, taken from homes, jobs, schools and even wildfire duty to serve as extras in Trump’s theater of power.
But while Guardsmen wait for permission to go home, the administration ratchets up its postured flexing. On Monday, Homeland Security officers dressed up as soldiers and rode on horseback, stomping around MacArthur Park. The scene was more amusing than threatening — onlookers whipped out cell phone cameras to document the sight of horses traversing the grounds. 
The horses, incidentally, are proof of the theater of this: Real police don’t use horses to make arrests. Fake police ride them to conduct what they, in full unawareness of irony, described as a “show of presence.”
Alerted by residents of the commotion, Bass arrived at the scene and urged the forces to leave. Eventually, having kicked up a little dust, they did.
The federal government named it “Operation Excalibur.” Seriously. You can ‘t make this stuff up.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070725-MacArthur-Park-Feds-JW-CM-27.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

A California law took effect in 2020 that dropped the statute of limitations for filing lawsuits, provided a three-year window for victims to file claims and otherwise made it easier for them to sue school districts and counties.



When Samantha Muñoz was a second grader at Fancher Creek Elementary in Clovis, her teacher told her she “wasn’t that bright” and needed extra help with schoolwork. He’d make her stay in the classroom at recess, or tell her to sit on his lap while other students were busy with assignments. 
During those quiet times in the classroom, she said, he sexually abused her — over and over, for at least a semester, even after the school principal walked in on him.
“No one knew. I just didn’t know who to run to. I ran to the school, and they shut me down into silence,” said Muñoz, who’s now 28. “But (now) I’ve figured, no one should be living like this. It’s time to speak your truth and make it OK to talk about. It’s a sensitive topic, but it needs awareness and closure.”
Muñoz, who lives in Fresno County, is part of a multi-plaintiff lawsuit against the Clovis Unified School District alleging the district knew about Muñoz’s teacher but — for at least seven years, from 2005-2012 — did not stop him from abusing students. Clovis Unified had no comment on the case because of the litigation.
Muñoz’s case is one of at least 1,000 lawsuits against California school districts and counties stemming from AB 218, a sexual abuse reform law that took effect in 2020. It temporarily dropped the statute of limitations, provided a three-year window for victims to file claims and otherwise made it easier for them to sue school districts and counties.
The cases span decades, some as early as the 1940s. In many cases the perpetrator is dead, the district staff has turned over, and there’s no longer a paper trail of the original complaint, if there ever was one. 
The new law has resulted in a slew of payouts to abuse survivors, most in the range of $5 million to $10 million but some much higher. In 2023 a jury delivered a $135 million verdict against Moreno Valley Unified in Riverside County. Los Angeles Unified is expecting to pay more than $500 million to settle a portion of its claims. Overall, the claims against schools total nearly $3 billion. 
Counties also have paid out large sums of money. In April, Los Angeles County paid $4 billion to settle 6,800 abuse claims from victims who were abused in foster care or in probation department facilities. Like many government entities, Los Angeles County is self-insured.
The settlements have been so large that they’ve brought some school districts to the brink of financial insolvency and state takeover. They’ve also resulted in steep spikes in insurance payments for all school districts, regardless of whether they’ve been sued.
‘Untenable’
Carpinteria Unified is among those districts facing financial collapse.
The predominantly low-income Latino district near Santa Barbara has been served with four sexual abuse lawsuits, all involving the same perpetrator: a principal who was convicted in 1986 of abusing several boys in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
“These suits are settling for $5 million to $10 million each, and we have a $42 million budget. You do the math,” said Superintendent Diana Rigby. “It’s untenable.”
The district has already spent $750,000 on legal fees, and has had to lay off staff, increase class sizes and cut field trips, enrichment activities and other programs to pay its legal bills. Although the district had insurance at the time of the abuse, the company has since gone out of business and its current insurance company won’t cover old claims.
The perpetrator is dead and the district staff has turned over 100% since the incidents occurred. Years ago, the district instituted strict protocols for abuse claims, immediately contacting the police and placing the alleged perpetrator on leave until an investigation is complete.
Rigby worries about how her district will survive. If the state takes it over, it’ll lose its school board and superintendent, and further cuts will be inevitable.  
“We believe all the victims need to be compensated for these heinous crimes,” Rigby said. “But AB 218 is causing current students and taxpayers to pay for crimes that happened 50 years ago, that they had nothing to do with. There has to be a better solution.”
Legislative solution?
Several current bills in the Legislature would curb the law, at least somewhat. A bill by Sen. John Laird, SB 577, would bring back a statute of limitations, make it easier for districts to issue bonds to pay off settlements and take other steps to give some relief to school districts and other public agencies. But it doesn’t cap attorneys’ fees or settlements.
The political reality, Laird said, is that there’s not enough support in the Legislature to limit legal settlements in abuse cases. 
“We’re trying to walk between the poles of avoiding billions of dollars in settlements, while not neglecting the rights of victims,” said Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz. 
The bill passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly judiciary committee.
Consumer Attorneys of California is neutral on the bill, but several school lobbying groups have opposed it, saying it doesn’t go far enough. One group, the Association of California School Administrators, would also like to see school districts share responsibility for paying settlements with the perpetrator or other groups that might be involved, such as sports or after-school organizations. The group also wants the state to study the possibility of a victims’ fund that’s not entirely monetary; it could also include mental and physical health services.
The abuse settlements are the worst financial threat to school districts since the Great Recession of 2008-2009, said Mike Fine, director of the Fiscal Crisis Management and Assistance Team, which advises the state and school districts on financial matters. 
“These suits are settling for $5 million to $10 million each, and we have a $42 million budget. You do the math. It’s untenable.”Diana Rigby, superintendent at Carpinteria Unified
His group is recommending that the state create a database of abuse claims as well as teachers who have been accused, to prevent perpetrators from bouncing from one district to another. The group also recommends more flexibility on settlement payment plans, and an alternative to state takeover for districts that are out of money. 
Like Laird, Fine’s group is not calling for a cap on settlements or attorney fees. “We didn’t think tort reform was within our scope,” Fine said.
They’re also not calling for a state-financed victims’ fund, something school districts have asked for. Laird said the state lacks the money for such a fund. Fine’s group omitted it from its recommendations because a victims’ fund could preclude a trial, and Fine said that victims should have a right to go to court and have their voices heard.
But schools’ top priority, Fine said, should be setting tough protocols to prevent abuse from happening in the first place. Although some districts have instituted safeguards, not all have, and the state doesn’t have a uniform policy because it’s deemed a local issue.
“Schools have to hold themselves to a higher standard, and we’ve clearly failed in this regard,” Fine said. “This simply has to stop.”
‘Prime time’ for trial attorneys
The sexual abuse law has been a windfall for trial attorneys. Billboards seeking clients have cropped up around the state, and lawyers from throughout the country have come to California to file claims. 
Typically attorneys in abuse lawsuits work for free until there’s a resolution, and then collect a portion of the payout if the plaintiff prevails — in some instances up to 40%, depending on the complexity of the case. 
Dorothy Johnson, legislative advocate for the Association of California School Administrators, called the current scenario “prime time” for trial attorneys in California, but forcing impossible burdens onto school districts and other agencies. Schools are already contending with financial hardships due to declining enrollment, the end of pandemic relief funds and federal education cuts. These settlements are pushing some districts over the edge — while attorneys are making millions, she said.
“We don’t think trial attorneys should be profiting at the expense of current students,” Johnson said. “We want to make sure victims get resolution but at the same time put some guardrails up. Right now, there are no guardrails.”
The trial attorneys’ association is not opposed to changes in the law, as long as victims’ rights aren’t curtailed, said Nancy Peverini, legislative director for California Consumer Attorneys.
“There’s an understanding that we need to find a balance, but it’s really important that survivors’ voices don’t get lost,” Peverini said. 
Hard choices in Montecito
Montecito — a scenic enclave near Santa Barbara — is home to Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities. With sweeping views of the Pacific and Santa Ynez mountains, it’s one of the most affluent and exclusive towns in the country. Its school district, however, is facing financial calamity and a possible state takeover.
Montecito Union Elementary District serves about 350 students, mostly children from affluent families but also the children of Montecito’s landscapers and housekeepers. Earlier this year, it took in 42 students from Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed in a wildfire. 
In 2023, three former students sued the district over sexual abuse they said they experienced from 1972-76. The district denied the claim, and is negotiating a settlement. The payout and legal costs could swell to $20 million — more than the district’s annual budget. Even a state loan wouldn’t solve the problem, because the payments would be more than the district can afford, according to Fine’s organization.
The district’s insurance company at the time of the alleged abuse no longer exists, and its current insurer doesn’t cover events from that long ago. That means that like Carpinteria Unified, Montecito will have to pay the entire cost — cutting programs, borrowing money and using reserves.
“First of all, there’s a whole lot of empathy. We were heartbroken to hear these allegations,” Superintendent Anthony Ranii said. “But none of us were here then. Many of us weren’t even born. The alleged perpetrator and witnesses are dead. We’re putting the responsibility for something that might or might not have happened in 1972 100% on the heads of students in 2025. That’s not fair.”
‘We need awareness’
For Muñoz, the abuse she suffered during the 2004-05 school year took more than a decade to come to terms with. Even after the abuse stopped, Muñoz found school difficult, socially and academically. She lost trust in adults and emotionally withdrew. She never talked about what happened, not even to her family.
Neng Yang, the teacher whom Muñoz said abused her, was arrested and tried in 2014 on 45 counts of sexual abuse on a child under age 10, based on testimony from numerous victims who were students at Fancher Creek Elementary. He was convicted and is serving a 38-year sentence.
Muñoz only started talking about the abuse a few years ago, when she started reading about the impacts of childhood abuse. Earlier this year, she got a call from Pfau Cochran Vertetis Amala, a Washington-based law firm, that was investigating claims from another of Yang’s victims for a potential suit against Clovis Unified.
She decided to share her story with the attorneys and join the lawsuit.
“I just want other victims to know that they’re not the only ones,” Muñoz said. “It’s OK to talk about it. We need awareness if there’s going to be change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070825-Elementary-School-SK-47.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

Housing bills in California often face fierce opposition from construction unions. The carpenters’ union went their own way, becoming a “game-changing” force in the debate.


When Gov. Gavin Newsom last week signed the biggest effort in years to undo red tape for housing development, he singled out one group for credit.
“This is the third of the last four years we’ve been together signing landmark housing reforms, and it simply would not have happened without the Carpenters,” Newsom said. 
The California Conference of Carpenters has emerged in recent years as one of the most influential voices on housing in Sacramento. The new law rolls back California’s landmark environmental review law to exempt urban apartment developments, an idea once considered a legislative third rail. It’s the most significant yet in a string of bills intended to boost housing production that lawmakers have passed with the union’s help. 
The Carpenters’ involvement has given some Democratic lawmakers the opportunity to address the housing crisis with the blessing of a construction union. 
They’ve presented an alternative to more traditional demands from organized labor embodied by the State Building and Construction Trades Council, which has opposed nearly all high-profile proposals to lower hurdles for developers that do not include minimum pay levels and union hiring requirements that some housing advocates see as so stringent and costly they effectively hamper building more housing.
The Trades, an umbrella group of 14 affiliated construction unions, are a force in the Capitol. Their members turn out reliably for campaign door-knocking and they are affiliated with the powerful California Labor Federation. Over the past 10 years, the Trades’ statewide and regional councils have donated more than $6.7 million to legislative candidates; the affiliated unions have collectively donated at least another $32 million.
The Carpenters, with its northern and southern councils, spend a formidable amount themselves: nearly $6 million on legislative races in the past decade, rivalling any of the Trades’ unions.
“Unions carry a lot of weight in Sacramento and for good reason,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat and an author of the environmental carveout law. “It’s important that we’re supporting good-paying jobs and I don’t want to take anything away from them. But we have to look around at what’s working and we have to build 2.5 million homes. The Carpenters have come to the table with more creative solutions.”
Division bursts into public view
Not everyone is on board. The carpenters’ stance has created a split in the labor movement that makes lawmakers uneasy and sometimes spills into public view. 
With the Carpenters’ backing, lawmakers and Newsom last month tried at the last minute of budget deliberations to push through a version of Wicks’ bill that included minimum wages for residential construction workers. The proposed wages were higher than most of the typical non-union wages for private developments, but $40 to $60 lower per hour than the prevailing wages required on publicly subsidized projects — a state-calculated figure that amounts to union-level pay. 

Backlash came swiftly. Following the Trades’ lead, union leader after union leader lined up at the Capitol to slam the proposal, arguing it would undermine their members’ higher wages. Lawmakers quickly scrapped the proposal.
“The Carpenters, in my view, are a pariah” in the labor movement, said Scott Wetch, a lobbyist for Trades-affiliated unions representing electrical workers, pipe fitters and sheet metal workers. “They’re willing to sell all workers down the river and pursue really unlivable wage rates so they can try to capture other unions’ work.”
But lawmakers say what caught their attention was more of a philosophical difference. Non-union laborers produce the majority of the state’s housing, and the Carpenters’ approach viewing them not as cheaper competition but as potential members of their union has made them “game-changing,” Wicks said. 
“The role of unions is to protect the workers in their organization,” said Danny Curtin, director of the California Council of Carpenters. “But in the larger perspective, it’s to protect all workers, and then bring them into the union movement.”
Home building: The Wild West of construction
The intra-labor rift is as much a story of the American workforce as it is of California politics. 
With the exception of affordable and publicly subsidized projects, housing has been largely built with non-union labor for decades. In the late 1960s, corporate giants began backing contractors to resist union demands and promote non-union labor. An influx of immigrant workers, willing to accept lower pay, made it possible. Construction unions of all stripes found the small, scattered worksites of the residential market too difficult to organize when larger commercial, industrial or public works projects provided members steadier work, said UC Santa Barbara labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein.
Labor groups see home building as the Wild West of construction, rife with fly-by-night contractors, wage theft and physical hazards.  
In 2001, the national United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America split from the AFL-CIO, which includes the building trades unions. Douglas McCarron, president of the national carpenters’ union, claimed at the time that the labor umbrella group was overly focused on protecting existing members and failing to “shift resources to organizing” new ones. 
In 2022, Jay Bradshaw, the then-newly elected executive secretary-treasurer of the Northern California Carpenters Union, brought that approach to the state’s housing debates. 
Before then, development advocates and lawmakers could barely even introduce housing streamlining proposals without the Trades’ insertion of their favored labor standards, lobbyists and current and former lawmakers said. Sometimes, the Carpenters agreed with them.
But Bradshaw, who did not respond to interview requests for this story, was motivated by low pay and labor violations on non-unionized residential jobsites, which he often called “crime scenes,” said Sen. Scott Wiener, a major author of housing bills. Bradshaw wanted housing bills to include rules to improve those workers’ pay and conditions, but in contrast to the Trades, he was OK with those hired not being union members. 
“It changed everything,” Wiener said. “It created more space for more dialogue and less of the ‘my way or the highway’ approach.”
The theory was that by improving workers’ conditions and visiting job sites to enforce the new rules, the union could one day organize them. 
Carpenters focus on non-union workers
So the Carpenters in 2022 broke away from other unions to push for a bill Wicks authored that made it easier to convert strip malls and commercial properties to housing. It included requirements for developers to pay union-level wages, and for bigger projects, provide workers health benefits and agree to be monitored for wage theft and other labor violations. It did not include language favored by the Trades to hire a “skilled and trained” workforce — essentially, union labor.

The bill passed against the Trades’ wishes, though lawmakers also passed a second, similar bill with the Trades’ hiring language. The following year, they used a similar formula to pass a pair of streamlining bills. Along the way, the support of the Carpenters garnered the support of public school employees and service sector unions, and even some Trades-affiliated unions. 
“Count us shoulder-to-shoulder with anyone who will continue to drive to pull those workers up and in, as they should be,” Bradshaw said at last week’s bill-signing ceremony, “to support union labor and protect that, but to make sure that union labor should be held to account to represent all workers.”
Other unions use a similar method of organizing in an era of low unionization rates and an economy defined by subcontracting and franchising.
The Service Employees International Union, which has backed some of the Carpenters’ efforts on housing bills, has also spent years pulling non-union, heavily immigrant workers into the labor movement in part by making policy demands. Its signature Fight for $15 organizing effort in fast food restaurants, an industry notoriously difficult to unionize, got California lawmakers to mandate a $20 minimum wage for fast food workers in 2023. 
But in restaurants, there isn’t a union of well-paid, skilled workers looking to safeguard their own jobs.
Major reforms to California environmental law
There were already bouts of bad blood between the Carpenters and the other construction unions over the years. In particular, the San Francisco Trades council has accused the Carpenters of bidding on projects for their own members, “attempting to claim and steal the work” from other specialized craftspeople. 
So attempts to write alternative labor standards into housing laws have come across to the Trades’ unions as undercutting their contracts — or, as Wetch described it, “trying to benefit your organization to the detriment of others.” 
The dispute over minimum wages last month sent that dynamic into overdrive.

The new wage standard the Carpenters backed was presented as a way to provide a minor wage hike for the lowest paid construction workers, who are virtually all non-union.
Chris Hannan, president of the Trades council, said the organization was so outraged by the proposal because it could have undercut wage schedules incorporated into union apprenticeship programs. He also said writing new construction wages into state law that are below the union-level prevailing wages would “set a dangerous precedent that may extend outside of residential construction.”
To Hannan, promoting union hiring is how lawmakers can preserve California’s middle class. If lawmakers can guarantee there are new projects for Trades workers, the Trades would expand apprenticeships to bring new workers into well-trained, well-paid positions. 
He declined to discuss in detail his disagreements with the Carpenters. But he said the proposal for lower-than-prevailing wages went too far.
“In the past, whether we thought a labor standard (proposed by the Carpenters) was sufficient or not, at least they were meaningful,” Hannan said. “This here, this time, was just a complete non-starter.”
In the end, the California Environmental Quality Act changes passed without the controversial wage proposal, which made the Trades neutral rather than opposed to the bill. It includes labor enforcement language the Carpenters said would help them root out the worst actors, such as adding liability for the developer if their contractors or subcontractors are caught underpaying workers. 
The Trades say they, too, got what they wanted. For new infill apartments to skip CEQA review, the law requires union-level wages for projects with 100% affordable units, and some union hiring for projects that are taller than 85 feet.
Most developments over 85 feet use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway, and most entirely income-restricted housing projects make use of public subsidies that require union-level wages. These were relatively modest concessions that Wicks said “we were happy to make.”
That leaves market rate and mixed-income apartment buildings under seven-or-so stories, which define the bulk of urban development in California. Hannan acknowledged that those new developments can now skip CEQA review without any new labor rules — whether favored by the Trades or the Carpenters. 
“There’s a lot of work to be done there,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

Written by Minnesota journalists Dave Hage and Josephine Marcotty, it tells the story how the tallgrass prairie was transformed into an agricultural landscape, the environmental consequences, and the choices we face for a better future in farming, and for protecting what’s left of the tall grass prairie and the critically important grasslands in the West. This excerpt was drawn from the chapter called Prairie II, which details the history of the Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Area in northwest Minnesota near Crookston, the largest prairie restoration in the United States. Ask your local library or find the book at Magers & Quinn or your other favorite indepedent bookseller.
Driving north on Highway 75 today, through the middle of what long ago was a diverse prairie complex of marshes, fens, and grasses, you travel through farm fields stretching uninterrupted to the horizon. Drained and plowed, the land in the Red River Valley produces the crops that feed many of America’s habits — corn for livestock and ethanol fuel, sugar beets for sweets, potatoes for McDonald’s french fries. Alongside the road the edges of the fields are shaved as precisely as a fade haircut. Groves of trees in the distance mark where farmhouses stand, and in the cemeteries, gravestones stand up like tiny buildings against the sky. On any given afternoon the land seems empty of people, animals, and even insects; after hours of driving on a warm summer day, the windshield is clear of dead bugs. The only remnants of the prairie are patches of wildflowers in the ditches, great layers of clouds that climb into the sky, and the big winds that sweep down from the northwest. 
The road cuts through the town of Crookston in the northwest corner of Minnesota, past grain silos, endless freight trains, and a sugar beet processing plant, and turns straight east. Here the land begins to roll a bit, like swells on an ocean. On the satellite images it’s obvious what these once were — beaches of the massive lake. The sandy ridges rise like giant curved steps as you drive east, stretching from far north in Manitoba to central Minnesota and South Dakota. Thousands of years ago, these were the constantly moving edges of Lake Agassiz as it grew and contracted, the place where wind and water dumped the sand and gravel. 
Seven miles or so east of Crookston, the cornfields end abruptly and there is nothing but grass. A dragonfly smacks into the windshield, and overhead a flock of ducks comes in for a landing on an open stretch of shallow water. A sign at the edge of a mowed parking area provides an explanation: This is Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge, the largest prairie restoration project in U.S. history. 
Today, it is one of a handful of places left in the United States where you can walk for miles across a tallgrass prairie and get a taste of what the landscape once was. The silence, heightened by the sigh of wind through the grasses and the trill of birds, is immense. Green leopard frogs race ahead through the grass. In early spring, giant clacking sandhill cranes descend on the wetlands by the thousands as they stop on their way north to nesting grounds in Canada, and the ethereal booming song of prairie chickens greets the rising sun as they do their annual mating dance in the grass. From May until October wildflowers bloom in waves — pink coneflowers, false indigo, goldenrod, coreopsis, purple lead plant. In some parts of the refuge, the grass grows so high you have to stand on top of a car to see over it.

The story of Glacial Ridge explains how restoring grasslands, where it’s possible, can deliver huge rewards. But it also illustrates how extraordinarily difficult it is to claw the land back from some other economic purpose, often igniting deep cultural conflicts over land use. Today the people who succeeded in restoring the prairie on Glacial Ridge — conservationists mostly — look back in amazement at what they achieved. And they recognize that it is even more difficult in places other than this part of Minnesota. Here, there was an unusual combination of poor farmland, the deep pockets of the federal government and national conservation groups, and a culture that embraces hunting, fishing, and heading “up north” for vacations in the wild outdoors. It was that mix that made re-creation of the prairie possible. 
People have lived in the Red River Valley for at least thirteen thousand years, and their way of life evolved along with the climate and the changing landscape. Some eight thousand years ago, the climate warmed and the prairies pushed the forest border eastward. The people in the valley learned to use tools like flint for knives and spear-throwers that made them formidable hunters, of bison in particular. Over time, rainfall increased and the forest border moved westward again to where it is now, in central and northeast Minnesota. The Red River Valley and the parkland areas east of it — that mix of aspen trees, brush, and wetlands — became a cultural melting pot. It attracted people with forest traditions and ways of life from the east, the Great Plains nomadic people from the west, and others who lived farther south in the Mississippi River Valley. They hunted moose in the forest and bison on the plains, fished for sturgeon in the Red River and its tributaries, and grew crops around permanent villages. 
Early Europeans universally described the wide Red River Valley as a patchwork of grassland, marshes, and impenetrable swaths of brush. In the winter, bison would congregate on the twisting, frozen rivers, and when the ice broke up in the spring, the animals would drown in vast numbers, their carcasses floating downstream for days on end. The land rose slowly eastward from the forested floodplain along the Red River, becoming tall grassland on the flat, former lake bottom, then rising a few hundred feet up to the grassy, rippled beach ridges that marked the eastern edge of Lake Agassiz. Water and silt collected between the ridges, creating long shallow marshes and lakes, quaking bogs, and, in places where mineral-rich groundwater welled up from below to feed them, the rare wetlands called calcareous fens. 
When the first European traders arrived in the 1700s, the forest-dwelling Ojibwe occupied the northern reaches of the valley, and the bison-hunting Dakota lived in the south. When the fur traders arrived, the people’s economy changed dramatically, as both Indigenous groups competed to supply the beaver, muskrats, and other furs to make the hats and coats that were in huge demand in eastern and European markets. In exchange, they received tools, blankets, guns, and other goods — the technology of another culture. 
Settler colonialism in the Red River Valley began in earnest in the mid-1800s, driven by the growth of railroads and the land speculation that came with it. Steamboats moving up the Red River fueled development as they carried timber and other goods north, and buffalo hides south. Later they carried immigrants from southern Minnesota and Europe, who began to grow wheat that was carried south. Their numbers accelerated with the 1862 passage of the Homestead Act, which gave each farmer 160 acres of land, and the arrival of the railroads, which created a permanent link between Manitoba and St. Paul. The Native people were pushed to the western plains, where the fierce Lakota still reigned, or onto reservations established in the 1860s in northern Minnesota. European farmers raised barley, oats, and potatoes — and wheat. To spur colonial expansion, the federal government gave land to the railroads as well, and they sold it to settlers and land speculators. 
Though productive, the clay soils left behind on the flat bottom of the ancient lake were poorly drained, and when wet were called “gumbo.” They were so deep that horses would sink up to their bellies and couldn’t be pulled out. Sometimes, farmers would equip them with wooden “snowshoes” to stop them from sinking into the mud. 
Steam power came to the valley in the late 1800s and so did drainage, funded in part by the railroads. The Red River Valley Drainage Commission was created in 1893 to coordinate the construction of ditches and water movement across the land, which was frequently inundated with spring floods. By 1899 there were twenty main ditches totaling 135 miles, many of them draining railroad lands. Then plowing up the prairie began in earnest. As global demand for wheat increased and crop diseases devastated the harvests farther east, bonanza farms, which were up to tens of thousands of acres in size, flourished on the valley floor. 
By 1890, 70 percent of the valley was plowed for crops, and a few decades later, just as in the southern and eastern grasslands, the prairie was largely gone. In the Red River Valley, with its flat landscape and gumbo soils, drainage was especially critical to the advance in agriculture. By 1920 roughly three thousand miles of ditches that dropped just a few inches for every mile on the flat land drained three million acres along the Red River. 
But the ancient beach ridges left behind by Lake Agassiz, which cover thousands of square miles on either side of the Red River, were a different story. Compared to the big agricultural operations on the former lake bottom, farms on the ridges were smaller and more diversified. Farmers grew wheat and oats on the dry land and hayed the wet meadows where they could, and cattle ranching was common well into the 1970s. But it was poor farmland — the ridges dried out in the summer and the lower swales fed by groundwater stayed wet well into the late spring. Compared to the broad river valley farther west, this higher ground had more trees, more ponds, more livestock, and more grass. And in those small refuges, many of the prairie plants and animals that are now rare or endangered survived. 
In the 1980s, 24,000 acres of grazing land on the beach ridges east of Crookston were purchased for $1 million by an out-of-state owner. At the time, rising prices for corn and wheat, together with a string of dry years that shrank the wetlands, made row crop agriculture possible even on the unforgiving soils of the beach ridges. Conservationists looked on in dismay as the big plows and bulldozers began tearing up the remaining prairies, and replaced them with soybeans and corn. Among them was Ron Nargang, who worked for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and, later, The Nature Conservancy. He figured the new owner and the local farmers who leased land from him could make money only because during bad years they could claim payments from federal crop insurance programs. 
In the late 1990s the rains returned, and, as a result, so did the wetlands. As yields declined, the property came up for sale again. The Nature Conservancy staff spent hours examining maps of the region, trying to decide which scraps of land to buy, and finally someone said, “Why not buy the whole thing?” In 2000 The Nature Conservancy took the extraordinary step of putting down $9 million to buy the entire property: thousands of acres of plowed fields, drained and undrained wetlands, 165 miles of ditches, fragments of native prairie, a gravel pit, a grain elevator, and an old feedlot that came with a pile of livestock carcasses. 
Across the midsection of the United States, only a few large tracts of native grasslands remain — the Flint Hills in Kansas, the Sandhills in Nebraska, and the Loess Hills in western Iowa. Northwestern Minnesota has the Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge — more than sixty thousand acres of native grass and wetlands. Glacial Ridge, however, was something else. It would become another example of the human capacity to transform landscapes, only this time it would be from cropland back to prairie.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-11-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

(Photo: Michael Lyle/ Nevada Current)Clark County officials have recently touted its Navigation Center, a 70-bed noncongregate shelter that stabilizes unhoused people before referring them to other transitional housing programs and treatment, as the model that could help address Southern Nevada’s growing homelessness crisis.
Speaking at an event Wednesday honoring its two-year anniversary since opening the facility, Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom said local officials have discussed replicating the intake center valley wide. 
It’s still uncertain how the slashing of federal funding, including major cuts to Medicaid, might undermine the county’s goal to build additional centers and connect unhoused people staying at those facilities to services.
Many of the resources provided through the Navigation Center, like referrals to health care providers or mental health treatment, are paid through various types of federal funding, including Medicaid, Segerblom said.
The county is taking into account  “what we will potentially lose” from all the federal cuts, he added.  
“We are all terrified, frankly,” Segerblom said. “We are very aware all this is on a house of cards.” 
President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that was signed into law this month features steep reductions to the social safety net, including major cuts to Medicaid and food benefits. 
Nevada stands to lose about  $590 million annually in federal Medicaid funding for the next 10 years and more than 114,500 Nevadans are estimated to lose coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Trump is also proposing additional cuts in his 2026 fiscal budget across various agencies, including slashing U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget by more than 40%.
The cuts include a $532 million decrease in homeless assistance programs and a consolidation of several grants, like those provided by the federal Continuum of Care program that states use to address homelessness.
John Fernandez, program manager with WC Health, which the county contracts to provide case management at the Navigation Center, said they are still waiting to learn how cuts could impact operations and efforts to refer people to services.  
“If they don’t have Medicaid, it will make it difficult for them to receive any mental health providers or even doctors and get some of the assistance they need,” he said.


	Stabilizing people     
The Navigation Center is located in East Las Vegas in a former Motel 6, which was converted into the 70-bed intake center with semi-private rooms for unhoused people. 
During the height of Covid when it wasn’t safe for unhoused people to remain in large, congregate spaces like emergency shelters, the county converted former motels into noncongregate shelters.
Since opening in 2023, the Navigation Center has been used by the county as a starting place for people seeking to exit homelessness. They are usually referred to the facility by either a service provider or law enforcement. 
Once at the center, people can stay roughly 30 days, receive required case management twice a week, are assisted with getting vital documents like birth certificates, and begin to get connected to other housing resources or mental health assessments and treatment. 
“It gives them a chance to decompress from being unsheltered and then moving on where they can get more intensive wrap-around services and focus on long term housing solutions,” said Brenda Barnes, the social services manager.
The county said that nearly 1,800 people have cycled through the center since it opened.
While county officials said they are tracking what services people are referred to, how many were housed and recidivism rates of how many end up on the streets, they didn’t provide those figures Wednesday. 
For Justin Golden, a 37-year-old staying at the Navigation Center, the facility has become the place he has needed to stabilize his life.
After being released from City of Las Vegas jail in early June, he began couch-surfing as he tried to get connected to resources, like getting a new EBT card for his Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and finding employment. 
Three weeks ago, while sleeping in a park in Henderson, outreach workers from the Salvation Army referred him to the Navigation Center, he said. 
Golden lost his identification when he was arrested and struggled to get new documents since he was released, delaying the process of exiting homelessness. 
Less than three weeks into his time at the Navigation Center, he has been able to start collecting the documents needed and plans to transfer to another transitional housing program offered by the county by the end of the month.  
Since coming to the center, Golden has shared a room with 27-year-old Steven Martin, who has been experiencing homelessness for nearly a year after moving to Southern Nevada from California. 
Because of a criminal record, Martin said he has struggled to find employment and earn enough money to get back on his feet. 
He didn’t know where to turn, or where he could get resources, until he was referred to the Navigation Center by a provider. Martin also plans to go to a 90-day transitional housing program after his time is done at the Navigation Center. 
Though Fernandez has seen the center has been successful, he said the facility is often at capacity. 
The other noncongregate shelters he refers people to for the next part of their efforts to exit homelessness are also reaching capacity. 
It will likely create a backlog in the system. 
“I think if we could open up another navigation center it would be beneficial for everyone,” he said. “At this point, we are getting to a capacity where we can’t take too many people in. We only have 70 beds here. All the other properties are getting full as well. If we’re not able to transition people in 30 days to another property, then we can’t take more people.”
While opening the navigation center is one of the many steps the county is taking to address the homelessness crisis, the lack of permanent housing remains a fierce and stubborn barrier to addressing homelessness in Southern Nevada, Segerblom said.
“We need more housing,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

In May, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada successfully petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court to compel District Court Judge Lynne Jones to make a decision on a case involving Assembly Bill 227 from the 2021 Legislative Session.
The bill was designed to curb the use of under-the-table workers, gig workers, and other temporary labor on construction sites, which many argue are a pervasive problem in the industry. The bill clarified in statute that any work requiring a contractor’s license must be performed by a licensed contractor or by an employee of a licensed contractor. It removed ambiguous phrasing that had left a gray area for the use of temporary employees paid through IRS 1099-forms and “leased employees” provided by private employment agencies.
A law nobody wants to defend

After the bill passed and was signed into law by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a group of private employment agencies sued. Jones issued a temporary restraining order preventing enforcement of the law in October 2021, just days after it went into effect. According to court documents, the following year, in May 2022, Jones indicated to the plaintiff and defendants that a written order regarding injunction was imminent.
But no ruling came that year, or in 2023, or in 2024.
As reported by the Nevada Current last year, labor groups, including Carpenters Local 1977, began to publicly question what was holding up the legal proceedings. A definitive ruling could be appealed by either side, they argued, but inaction left everyone in limbo and only benefitted the groups who opposed AB227.
The Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada took action in early May of this year. The Nevada State Contractors Board, which was the defendant in the district court lawsuit over the bill, joined that petition, stating in their own court filing that they twice attempted to force a resolution on the matter with no success.
On May 28 the Nevada Supreme Court sided with the trades council and contractors board, issuing their requested order compelling Jones to rule on the matter.
Jones issued her decision on July 2.
In it, she denied the request for an injunction on AB227. She wrote that, while the court “found it appropriate to initially grant the (temporary restraining order),” it “reaches a different and opposite conclusion after consideration of the additional and substantial evidence, along with time and reflection.”
In the decision, Jones acknowledged that private employment agencies would likely be negatively impacted by enforcement of the bill but concluded that they had not met their legal burden to demonstrate a likelihood of success in their case against the bill.
“The Court finds there is harm to Plaintiffs, but it is not irreparable,” the order reads. “The PEAs have the option of changing their business model and becoming contractors.”
Jones also noted that another remedy exists, also outside of the court system: Private employment agencies could petition the Legislature to amend the law they passed in 2021.
Temp agencies clash with skilled trades over construction workforce bill

She also rejected the arguments by the plaintiffs that the bill was vaguely worded and gives preferential treatment to unions or union-affiliated contractors. Drafters of the legislation from the start argued that employee misclassification is an issue that impacts union and non-union labor.
American Staffing Association, one of the groups that sued to enjoin AB227, has said that private employment agencies provide approximately 4,000 workers to construction sites in Nevada annually.
It is not immediately clear what impact the lifting of the temporary restraining order will be.
The Nevada State Contractors Board, which is tasked with enforcing AB227, said in a statement to the Nevada Current they are “aware of the decision by Judge Jones” and “currently reviewing the court documents with counsel to determine next steps.”
The trades groups that intervened in the lawsuit also indicated they were still reviewing the court’s decision.
American Staffing Association did not respond to specific questions from the Current about what the decision means for their agencies going forward, but a spokesperson emailed a brief statement: “We’re disappointed with the decision.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1298420348-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 08:05:38.181266

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)As the evacuation orders are lifted and the Oak Ridge Fire reaches 87% containment, families on the Navajo Nation can begin focusing on recovery as they deal with the aftermath of a wildfire that has burned more than 11,000 acres.
Hundreds of firefighters responded to the wildfire and have been on the ground in the Oak Ridge area of the Navajo Nation near Window Rock, battling a blaze that the surrounding communities have never experienced before.
Initially, the firefighters faced high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions as the fire quickly expanded from 1,000 to 6,000 acres and eventually to 10,000 acres over the first few days, with no containment.
First responders caught a break when the weather shifted slightly, providing the area with some rain the first few days of July. The first containment report was issued on July 3, indicating a 6% containment rate.
The fire had burned 11,027 acres as of July 8, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs–Navajo Region.
The containment efforts were the result of the diligence of the firefighters, the BIA stated, which “allowed them to secure additional line in areas that were previously uncontained.”
The Navajo Nation Police Department, BIA–Navajo Region and Southwest Complex Incident Management Team 2 lifted all evacuation statuses in all zones on Tuesday morning.
“No evacuations of any type are in effect,” the responding agencies stated. “All residents are allowed to return to their residences.”

Even as the evacuation orders are lifted, the Navajo Nation Police Department has issued a public safety closure surrounding the fire area, as it remains an active incident with firefighters and equipment working to achieve full containment of the fire.
Hazards, such as stump holes, ash pits and hazardous trees, still exist within the fire footprint, according to the responding agencies. Additionally, members of the Burn Area Emergency Response Team will collect valuable data for post-fire recovery and response.
“The public is asked to abide by this closure and to not enter the area,” they stated.
The evacuation centers at the Ganado Field House and the Window Rock High School Event Center are closed, and the Navajo Nation Department of Management is preparing to pack and distribute donations to local chapter houses in the coming days. No more donations are being accepted for the Oak Ridge Fire.
Families who had livestock evacuated and are being sheltered at the Navajo Nation fairground have been advised to work with the Navajo Nation Department of Agriculture to coordinate the pickup and return of their livestock.
Hundreds of people responded in different ways to support the communities affected by the Oak Ridge Fire, from firefighting and evacuation efforts to donation drives and livestock assistance.
Multiple levels of resources and support contributed to the Oak Ridge Fire response. For one chapter house, council delegate and volunteer, their efforts include going door-to-door, distributing donations and helping displaced individuals feel more at home.

A chapter’s response
When the Oak Ridge Fire began, officials from the St. Michaels Chapter immediately took action and activated their community emergency response team as part of the chapter’s emergency response plan.
“It’s been tough,” said St. Michaels Chapter Vice President Craig Tsosie, who has been on the ground working with his community since the fire started on June 28.
He served as his chapter’s incident commander and led numerous on-the-ground operational efforts to support the community, including going door-to-door to inform people about the fire. Tsosie assisted families in evacuating their livestock and worked closely with volunteers during the donation intake and distribution process.
It took the work of volunteers, staff, and elected officials in the area to provide some sense of relief to their community, Tsosie said, because many Navajo people who were impacted were often confused about what to do.
“We’ve been doing the best we can to assist them,” he said.
St. Michaels Chapter President-elect Grabrial Arviso Freeland said they had a draft of the plan ready to share with the chapter before the fire hit.
“We never thought we would use it this quickly,” he said. Since the St. Michaels Chapter is its own governing body, it had the power to establish its emergency response team outside the Navajo Nation government’s response.
“It’s been intense,” he said, and they have only been successful in their response because of the volunteers and donations that came in to support them.
“We’re only five people strong as officials and staff — but with the volunteers, that has allowed us to account for who is going to handle the food distribution and care packages,” he added.

The chapter house responded to the wildfire in three phases. The first was an immediate response, which involved direct fire support from officials at the chapter house. The second was community support, ensuring they had access to resources, and the final phase was recovery, helping the community get back on its feet.
The St. Michaels Chapter House’s proactive response to the Oak Ridge Fire was a key part of their reassurance to the community, Tsosie said, because their elected officials are actively helping out the community.
Tsosie said they went out to as many houses as they could to warn people about the fire. They worked with families to evacuate their livestock and even took the chapter houses’ road-grading equipment to create fire lines around some of the homes.
“We took the dragger out and we made a big ol’ circle around their houses,” He said. They did that for about 60 houses from St. Michaels to Hunters Point.
“We didn’t go in there blindly,” Freeland said of their fire response efforts for the houses. They maintained contact with all the responding agencies and took their historical preservation team with them to ensure they did not disturb any critical areas.
The chapter established its incident command operations at St. Michaels Senior Center. They had five main areas of operation: incident command, operation lead, kitchen lead, donation lead and warehouse lead.
Chapter house staff documented all donations received to track their origin and the amount provided. Freeland said that it is required as part of their emergency response and it holds them accountable for donation intake.
Tsosie said they served families from Oak Springs, Hunters Point and St. Michaels as part of their response efforts, ensuring that individuals directly impacted received the donations.
There was a misconception that the donations were for anyone living in these communities, he said, and he often had to inform the public that they were only for families directly impacted by the fire.
The chapter house received donations from various entities on and off the Navajo Nation, including bales of hay, bottled water, snacks, bedding and hygiene products.
Native Health put a call out for donations to support families affected by the Oak Ridge Fire and has sent multiple loads of donations to the Navajo Nation, including the St. Michaels Chapter House.
Native Health Executive Director Walter Murillo said the extension of this help is part of his organization’s commitment to representing the community and addressing their need for aid in Native communities and families across Arizona.
On July 4, Native Health Phoenix board member Kimberly Dutcher delivered a carload of donations to St. Michaels, including bedding, water, snacks, toothbrushes and more.

Native Health is a health care agency in Phoenix that offers a variety of programs, including primary medical, dental and behavioral health services.
Dutcher is from the St. Michaels area. She said the response Native Health received for donations was truly overwhelming and heartening because the community came together to support its people.
“It’s a small part, but when one does their part, the combined efforts make a difference,” she said, adding that she hopes the victims of the fire will be able to regain some normalcy after this.
As of July 3, the chapter’s donation center served 100 residents from St. Michaels, 48 Oak Spring residents and 11 from Pine Springs.
With the fire nearing full containment, the chapter house deactivated its emergency response team on July 6. They stopped accepting donations and shifted to recovery efforts.
“As we transition from emergency response to recovery and mitigation, St. Michaels Chapter remains committed to supporting our community in the days ahead,” the chapter posted on their Facebook page.
“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the many surrounding communities and organizations for their overwhelming generosity and support during the Oak Ridge Fire response,” they wrote.
Freeland said they hope to provide an update to the St. Michaels community about their efforts during the Oak Ridge Fire, especially since not everyone was involved or impacted.
He said they want to be accountable for the resources they use and the donations they receive and show the community exactly how many people they serve.
“The main thing is to be transparent with the community,” Tsosie said, explaining that there has been some frustration in the community about their response.
By being transparent, Tsosie said that would reassure the community of what we’ve done, showing how many families have been helped and precisely what the chapter used.
“People were probably unaware that our equipment was out there,” he added. “We were the ones that have been out there, making buffers around their homes.”
After all the recovery efforts are done, Freeland said they will need to regroup to address some of the vulnerable points as a chapter operation and as a community when it comes to addressing future emergencies.
A delegate’s response
When the fire started, Navajo Nation Council Delegate Brenda Jesus was in Farmington, New Mexico, and received the call. She said she immediately began the drive back to her community. Jesus lives in St. Michaels and represents the Oak Springs and St. Michaels chapters.
“It’s been a rough couple of days,” Jesus said during an interview at the St. Michaels Senior Center on July 4. The impact of the Oak Ridge Fire within her communities was evident on her face as she frequently wiped away tears from her eyes before sharing her experience.
“I can honestly sit here and say that there were no structures impacted at all,” Jesus said, adding that she is happy she was able to provide her community some comfort and encouragement during the hard times.
“This is the first major wildfire that we’ve experienced,” she said, and it has been a learning experience that she hopes will spark discussion about an emergency response plan for the Navajo Nation so they have a team ready to respond.
“You need to be ready,” she added.
Jesus shared some of her frustration about the initial response from the central command center established by the Navajo Nation government, which never reached out to her directly about the fire.
“It’s sad to say that President Nygren and Vice President Montoya haven’t even visited St. Michaels or Oak Springs,” she said.
Jesus has been on the ground working with her communities since the very beginning. She has gone out into the community, providing updates door-to-door. Directed families to available resources and listened to their overarching concerns.
Jesus said she was disappointed with how the Navajo Nation Incident Command Center managed the emergency response for her community because the St. Michaels area had the most evacuees, with over 100 people displaced.
“My evacuees weren’t getting the care they needed at the event center, nor the necessities that they needed,” she said, adding that many reported to her that they were often provided snacks rather than a hot meal to get them through the day.
The Window Rock Fighting Scouts Event Center in Fort Defiance became the main shelter for anyone displaced by the Oak Ridge Fire. Volunteers and donations poured into the center to help the affected families.

In the early days of the fire, the media were allowed into the event center to speak with evacuees, but on July 3, the Arizona Mirror was denied access.
“I’ve been boots on the ground and we’ve been denied services and even have our own Navajo Nation departments try to shut down our little operation,” Jesus said. The St. Michaels command center underwent multiple inspections to maintain operations.
She said she has been in constant contact with community members, calling and texting them to remind them to watch for the fire and know when it is time to leave. She said she lost count of how many people she interacted with during her on-the-ground efforts.
“Racing back and forth on the road, just trying to get updates,” she said. “It was really heartbreaking.”
Jesus said she recalls being out in the woods at 1 a.m. trying to help a family get their sheep and goats into a trailer so they can all be evacuated.
“That’s their livelihood,” she said.
As they work on recovery efforts, Jesus said she hopes that officials will begin focusing on emergency response actions that will help their community, including having an updated map of their area that marks all the occupied homes.
“We had zero information,” she said in terms of the location of all the houses within her chapters that would be in the line of the fire.  “It’s very sad.”
“I’m working on the emergency response plan so that we’re readily available next time a disaster like this should happen,” she said, adding that she is advocating for staff and elected officials to take part in FEMA training.
Jesus said that what happened with the Oak Ridge Fire weighed on her heart, and at the end of each day, she would sit at her table to reflect on the day’s events.
“It brought tears to my eyes, but I’m glad that I was there to try to help as much as we can,” she said.
A volunteer’s response
Navajo woman Glenda Tsosie Wheeler is certified in community emergency response, and her first instinct was to respond when the Oak Ridge Fire broke out.
“I wanted to put it to good use,” Wheeler said, so she loaded up her truck and drove to Window Rock from her home in Steamboat, Arizona, to volunteer her services. Her daughter, Jaynica Wheeler, has been with her every step of the way.
Wheeler said she really enjoys helping her people anywhere and everywhere she can, and that is what brought her to Window Rock. She worked with the Incident Command Team, volunteered at the shelter and held various other roles.
Her first day, on June 28, was in Fort Defiance, where she handled numerous intake efforts for donations and evacuees.
Wheeler said she was often stationed with the people impacted by the fire and provided them assistance in any way she could.
“It’s been very tough,” she said.
Wheeler said that many of the families who came into the emergency shelter were frustrated and confused because they were being forced out of their homes.
“They came as is,” she said because many didn’t have enough time to take anything from their home. “Some of them came in with ash on them, or they had some red dye on them.”
It was a very emotional situation, Wheeler said, and many of the families coming in were in tears due to the stress.
Rather than traveling the hour back to her home in Steamboat, Wheeler said that she and her daughter often slept in their truck in between volunteer shifts.
Wheeler said the last person she worked with at the shelter expressed his gratitude toward her for taking care of him while he was there.
“It made me cry, because he is a stranger to me, and he doesn’t know me, and I don’t know him, but I managed to take care of him,” she added.
Wheeler said she was happy to help her community in need, and she continues to assist with the recovery efforts. She is helping with the distribution efforts led by the Navajo Nation and the chapters.
She hopes to see more community members and officials invest in emergency training, as it will continue to be necessary.
“Emergencies don’t have boundaries,” she said. “We all have to help one another and learn from the experience.”

Republican voters in Cullman County Tuesday will choose between four candidates to be the GOP nominee in the House District 12 special election for the Alabama House of Representatives. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Republican voters in Cullman County Tuesday will choose between four candidates to be the GOP nominee in the House District 12 special election for the Alabama House of Representatives.
Heather Doyle, a 43-year-old former teacher and realtor; Clint Hollingsworth, a 47-year-old used car dealership owner and member of the Cullman City Council ; Cindy Myrex, a 58-year-old realtor and Dan McWhorter, a 68-year-old sales manager, will compete against each other for the nomination.
The seat opened up after Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. The district covers part of Cullman County and is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. 
If one candidate does not receive 50% of votes, a special primary runoff will be held on Aug. 12 between the two candidates that received the most votes. The winner will face Democratic nominee Matthew Glover, the sole candidate in that party’s primary, in a general election for the seat on Oct. 28.
Cullman County was without House representation for the final weeks of the 2025 session. Prior to Harbison’s departure, Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.

The candidates

Doyle said in a recent interview that family court reforms are her first priority. If she is elected, she hopes to sponsor legislation similar to Kayden’s law, a 2022 Pennsylvania law that requires an evidentiary hearing during child custody proceedings to vet all allegations of abuse, according to the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
“I will fight to give children a voice in custody decisions and hold judges accountable for ignoring abuse, favoring outdated, dangerous, shared parenting models,” she said.
She said that if elected, she would run for the seat in the 2026 statewide elections, but not stand for re-election in 2030. 
“I think you’re elected by the people for the people. You should represent people,” Doyle said. “It shouldn’t be what anybody else can do for you or what you can gain financially from it.”
Hollingsworth said he will prioritize broadband access in rural Alabama, small businesses and affordable health care.
“Mental health is another component I’ve heard a little bit about with some of my folks that do have small businesses with their employees,” Hollingsworth said. “There’s several different topics that have kind of been brought up to me that are definitely on the priority list.”
He said voters should choose him because of his 17 years of service on the Cullman City Council.
“It takes somebody with experience, in my opinion, that can deal with everybody and  relationships, to be effective in Montgomery,” Hollingsworth said.
McWhorter said he would prioritize updating the property tax guidelines for seniors and a lottery bill to fund tuition at two-year colleges.
“We want to update that law, and that should reduce property taxes for people under 65,” he said.
He said voters should choose him because of his platform and background in negotiations through his career in sales.
“I actually have a platform. Two of the candidates are just basically general ideas and being conservative,” the Navy veteran said, without naming the candidates. “I think my negotiation skills are pretty sharp, and getting bills modified in order to get them through committee would be something I could offer also.”
Myrex said in an interview late last month that she had been planning to run for the seat since 2023, and originally planned to mount a campaign in the 2026 elections because she wanted to make a difference in her community.  Her top priority is mental health care in public schools and economic growth. 
“We have things that people don’t really realize is happening in the life of our children, and they need support while they’re at school,” she said. 
She said that even though she is a first-time candidate, voters should choose her because she has lived in Cullman County her whole life and can relate to her constituents’ needs.
“There’s not a disconnect between me and the constituents, the voters, the people of Cullman County. My heart will go to Montgomery and never forget who sent me down there to work on their behalf and be their voice,” Myrex said. “They’re counting on somebody, and I want them to count on me. I feel like I’m going to be the one that’s going to take it to heart and take it to Montgomery.”

Issues in the race

SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The bill allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. All four Republican candidates strongly oppose the legislation.
McWhorter said in an interview Thursday that he is drafting a bill to repeal the law. 
“There was nobody to say, ‘Hey, this is a bad idea,’ or complain or pass on what the constituents may have wanted, making the bill problematic,” McWhorter said. “So I’m going to try to appeal it.”
Doyle said she hopes to stop “back room deals” that lead to legislation like this. 
“SB 322 is a major ordeal right now, and I oppose backroom deals like SB 322 that allow cities to annex land without community input,” Doyle said.

Fundraising

Doyle has raised about $1,200 in her own money as of July 7, according to campaign finance records. She spent $1,085 of that.
Hollingsworth has raised over $77,000 as of July 7, according to campaign finance records. Most of his contributions come from individuals, but the SV&B political action committee (PAC) donated to the Hollingsworth campaign multiple times totalling $6,000, according to campaign finance records. The PAC has also donated to Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, this year. Hollingsworth spent about $17,000 of his funds.
Myrex has raised over $100,000 as of July 7, according to campaign finance records. Most of that from individual donors, with the Alabama Veterans PAC and Farm PAC, the fundraising arm of the Alabama Farmers Federation, contributing a combined $6,100. She has spent more than $73,000 mostly on advertising, according to the records.
McWhorter has raised over $6,000 as of July 7, according to campaign finance records. All but $1,000 of the donations are his own money, according to the records. He has spent about $1,400, according to the records.
How to vote
District 12 voters can choose between Doyle, Hollingsworth, McWhorter or Myrex for the Republican nomination on Tuesday. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. A runoff primary election will be held, if needed, on Aug. 12.

And Wednesday, she presented her vision for the year ahead in a State Board of Education retreat (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri should revisit the way it supports “chronically low-performing schools” over the coming year, state Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said as she unveiled her priorities in a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday.
The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s current approach is “cookie cutter,” she said, lacking individual supports customized to struggling schools.
“When you have a school district in crisis, there’s not a real plan on how to address that,” Eslinger said. “So we need to have a more comprehensive plan to address that.”
Board member Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, of Pasadena Hills, underlined the importance of careful intervention.
Westbrooks-Hodge spoke about a conversation she had with a school superintendent who worked in an Illinois district east of St. Louis when it lost accreditation.
“She described an intense, hands-on approach with the state of Illinois walking hand in hand,” Westbrooks-Hodge said. “She asked why that approach wasn’t done with underperforming school districts in Missouri.”
There are also challenges coming from the federal level with “disruption” in the U.S. Department of Education, Eslinger said. The department is “struggling to draw down federal dollars more consistently.”
She suggested “a shift in the way we manage our federal programs,” such as consolidating programs in a centralized application.
The department should also improve its data handling, she said, adding that DESE “needs to be much better and much more efficient in its data system.”
“I don’t know how many times I sat on the Senate floor, and I didn’t have the ability to rebut somebody’s idea of what was happening in public education because we don’t have the data,” Eslinger said.
The department also needs to improve its website and increase connectivity with the public.
There will be noticeable changes in the communications department, she said. Currently, the department is looking for a new director of communications.
“We have been responsive to people who have questions, but we haven’t talked to the state as a whole,” she said.
She has asked the state board to conduct annual evaluations of the commissioner, which the board wasn’t doing when she took office last year.
The board is meeting Wednesday and Thursday as part of a board retreat to reorient members to the expectations and responsibilities of the board. Half of the board are new appointees, and the department has a number of high-ranking employees in new positions.

,California,2025-07-10 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Holdouts in Marin County resist California rules speeding up multifamily housing,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/marin-county-housing-development-rules/,"State pressure to allow more housing in Marin County is relentless, but some in Fairfax aren't giving up without a fight.","Although California’s local governments have had state-designated targets for housing construction for decades, they have been enforced only in recent years.
As Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature ramped up pressure to make more land available for multifamily housing and modify design restrictions, resistance has stiffened, particularly in upscale suburban communities dominated by single-family homes.
City councils, under pressure from constituents to preserve the status quo, devised all sorts of strategies to fend off state officials, but the state has been relentless in insisting that local planning documents favor housing, with penalties for communities that don’t comply.
The epicenter of resistance has been Marin County, whose affluent residents simply don’t want their bucolic neighborhoods to be, as they see it, scarred by multifamily, multistory apartment buildings.
Fifty-four years ago, as Marin’s population was increasing rapidly, the county board of supervisors adopted a policy paper titled “Can the Last Place Last?” that called for strict restrictions on new housing. “This is the last place. There is nowhere else to go,” the manifesto declared, referring to those wanting to move to Marin as “hordes … now piling up.”
The state housing quotas threatened to undermine that attitude. A decade or so ago, while Jerry Brown was governor, the Legislature passed and he signed a measure giving Marin some relief by designating it as suburban rather than urban.
Nevertheless the resistance has continued, largely project-by-project. One such clash is underway in Fairfax, one of Marin’s most insular communities. A developer wants to convert a boarded-up former spa of hot tubs and yoga studios into a 243-unit apartment complex that would go a long way toward meeting Fairfax’s state housing goal.
City officials bucked fierce opposition to approve the project, and opponents are now seeking to recall the mayor and vice-mayor for what they see as betrayal of the town’s desire to maintain the status quo.
“This is a town just saying, ‘We don’t care what the law says, we’re gonna say no,’” Riley Hurd, an attorney for the developer told the San Francisco Chronicle. “I guess the plan is to pretend that the ministerial policy doesn’t exist. They’re gonna get their housing element decertified, they’re gonna get sued and lose. The question is why? It might be as simple as, ‘We are going to have a court make us do it.’”
Saying no to housing development is long-standing Marin County tradition. The county has scarcely added any population over the last half-century, even shunning development of new water supplies as a means of stopping housing projects.
However, the pressure to allow more housing is relentless and Marin County cannot resist it forever. If the Fairfax project continues to languish, the state will step in to override any effort to block and the community also faces a likely lawsuit from YIMBY Law, an organization that sues communities that violate state housing laws.
“Fairfax is walking into a buzzsaw,” YIMBY Law executive director Sonja Trauss says. “They are going to waste a lot of money and they are going to lose. They are having an absolute and complete freakout over one project that is not that big a deal.”
Not only is Fairfax likely to lose the battle over the apartment project, but Marin County, whose quota is 14,000 new housing units by 2032, is beginning to realize that it cannot continue to be a no-growth island.
The Marin Independent Journal, in a recent editorial, notes that the Marin County Planning Commission has seen several resignations lately due to “frustration over the county’s approach to the state’s ultra-ambitious housing goals and Sacramento’s undermining of local control to streamline the county and city approvals for new development.”
“State streamlining of land-use approvals has upended the process, eliminating public involvement and sidelining appointed and elected decision-makers,” the newspaper lamented.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051625_School-Street-Plaza_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-10 08:05:38.181266

A group of Black men in Jonesboro, Louisiana, led by Earnest “Chilly Willy” Thomas and Frederick Douglas Kirkpatrick, founded The Deacons for Defense and Justice to protect civil rights activists. 
The deacons, most of them veterans of the Korean War, World War II or both, began providing protection after the Congress of Racial Equality’s freedom house became a target of the Ku Klux Klan. They went on to provide security for civil rights leaders and for events such as the 1966 March Against Fear in Mississippi. 
Their presence helped deter the KKK’s intimidation and violence against African Americans. Future Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael drew inspiration from the deacons. 
“Here is a group which realized that the ‘law’ and law enforcement agencies would not protect people, so they had to do it themselves,” he said. “The deacons and all other blacks who resort to self-defense represent a simple answer to a simple question: What man would not defend his family and home from attack?” 
By 1968, the Deacons had begun to fade from the scene, overshadowed by groups like the Black Panthers. A 2003 TV movie, starring Forest Whitaker and Ossie Davis, depicted the story of the Deacons and others in the civil rights movement.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102312/July10-FeatImage-Deacons-for-Defense-poster.jpg,,,2025-07-10 09:08:01.130332

The board heard a presentation on the implementation of a new anti-vaping law in schools (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama schools are set to implement a new system to prevent vaping by public school students in the coming academic year. 
HB 8, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Drummond D-Mobile, requires the Alabama State Board of Education to create a model policy for local boards of education to adopt by November.
“[Drummond] wanted an anti-vaping law, so we were able to work with her on something that’s not too overwhelming for the districts, but they are all going to have an anti-vaping policy,” State Board of Education Superintendent Eric Mackey told members of the board in a meeting on Tuesday.
Under the proposed policy, students who are caught vaping once will have their parents contacted and students who are caught vaping twice will have to take a state approved vaping awareness, education and prevention class which includes a curriculum created in collaboration with the Drug Education Council.
The topics covered in the proposed curriculum presented to board members include health consequences, peer pressure, nicotine and addiction, resources to quit vaping and common misconceptions about vaping among others.
According to the Children’s of Alabama newsroom, the media branch for the Children’s of Alabama hospital, nearly 20% of high school students in 2023 said they had vaped. 
Some board members at Tuesday’s meeting questioned the need for the vaping law. 
“As an educator, parent and grandparent, I don’t quite understand the focus on this and bifurcating or separating from the other common concerns in every discipline policy,” said Wayne Reynolds, who represents District 8 on the board. “Why would you separate what you’re doing to a child caught vaping and contacting the parents than any other child in the discipline policy?”
District 1 Representative Jackie Zeigler raised concerns about children moving onto other drugs like Fentanyl and Xylazine or tranq and pushed for broader language in the law to prevent having to add resolutions to add other specific items such as marajuana into the law.
“I don’t think by labeling it does any justice,” she said. “We need to make it broader so these things fit into it so we don’t have to come back and say, ‘now we have [THC] gummies, and now we have vaping.’”
Mackey agreed that the law is more specific than most Alabama Department of Education policies, but because it’s the law they have to follow it and said the board is “being no more restrictive than the law requires.”

(Photo: National Cancer Institute/cancer.gov)The Trump administration’s broadsides against scientific research have caused unprecedented upheaval at the National Cancer Institute, the storied federal government research hub that has spearheaded advances against the disease for decades.
NCI, which has long benefited from enthusiastic bipartisan support, now faces an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers — some fired, others leaving in exasperation.
After years of accelerating progress that has reduced cancer deaths by a third since the 1990s, the institute has terminated funds nationwide for research to fight the disease, expand care, and train new oncologists. “We use the word ‘drone attack’ now regularly,” one worker said of grant terminations. “It just happens from above.”
The assault could well result in a perceptible slowing of progress in the fight against cancer.
Nearly 2 million Americans are diagnosed with malignancies every year. In 2023, cancer killed more than 613,000 people, making it the second-leading cause of death after heart disease. But the cancer fight has also made enormous progress. Cancer mortality in the U.S. has fallen by 34% since 1991, according to the American Cancer Society. There are roughly 18 million cancer survivors in the country.
That trend “we can very, very closely tie to the enhanced investment in cancer science by the U.S. government,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and a globally recognized expert on prostate cancer.
“We’re winning,” Knudsen said. “Why we would let up, I really don’t understand.”
This article is based on interviews with nearly two dozen current and former NCI employees, academic researchers, scientists, and patients. KFF Health News agreed not to name some government workers because they are not authorized to speak to the news media and fear retaliation.
“It’s horrible. It’s a crap show. It really, really is,” said an NCI laboratory chief who has worked at the institute for three decades. He’s lost six of the 30 people in his lab this year: four scientists, a secretary, and an administrator.
“If we survive I will be somewhat surprised,” he said.
After a mandate by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Government Efficiency to slash contract spending by more than a third, the cancer institute is cutting contracts to maintain precious biological specimens used in its research, according to three scientists. “The required contract cuts are going to be devastating,” a senior scientist said.
On the NCI campus in Bethesda, Maryland, scientists describe delays in getting essential supplies — “literally anything that goes into a test tube or a petri dish,” a recently departed clinician said — because of staffing cuts and constant changes in policies about what they can order.
Even the websites that publish new evidence on cancer treatment and diagnosis aren’t being updated, because HHS fired workers who managed them. And when NCI scientists do communicate with outsiders, what they say has been severely restricted, according to documents viewed by KFF Health News. Forbidden topics include mass firings, President Donald Trump’s executive orders, and “DEIA” – diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.
The turmoil at the National Institutes of Health’s largest arm could haunt the country and the world for years to come.
“I really, really don’t understand what they’re trying to achieve,” said Sarah Kobrin, chief of NCI’s health systems and interventions research branch. “It just doesn’t make sense.”
“Efforts that are lifesaving now are being curtailed,” one scientist said. “People will die.”
Years of bipartisan support
Initially, some workers said, they thought the cancer institute might be spared. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called chronic disease — cancer is one — “an existential threat” to the country. Cancer research, with multiple NCI-funded breakthroughs in genetics and immunotherapy, has sidestepped the political minefields around other public health issues, like vaccination.
“People who care about cancer might be the biggest lobby in the country,” said Paul Goldberg, editor and publisher of The Cancer Letter, which has monitored oncology science and policy since 1973.
Count Mike Etchamendy, 69, of Big Bear Lake, California, as part of that lobby. Since 2013 he’s flown to the East Coast scores of times to participate in five clinical trials at the cancer wing of NIH’s Clinical Center.
“They call it the House of Hope,” Etchamendy said. Between drugs, therapeutic vaccines, and expert treatment for his rare bone cancer, called chordoma, he said, he believes he’s gained at least 10 years of life. He’s proud to have served as a “lab rat for science” and worries about NCI’s future.
“People come from all over the world to learn there,” Etchamendy said. “You cut funding there, you’re going to cut major research on cancer.”
In response to a list of detailed questions from KFF Health News about the cuts and chaos at NCI, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the reporting amounted to a “biased narrative” that “misrepresents a necessary transformation at the National Cancer Institute.” Nixon declined to elaborate but said research into cancer and other health conditions continues to be a high priority “for both NIH and HHS.”
“We are refocusing resources on high-impact, evidence-based research — free from ideological bias or institutional complacency. While change can be uncomfortable for those invested in the status quo, it is essential to ensure that NCI delivers on its core mission,” he said.
Much of NCI’s work is authorized by the National Cancer Act of 1971, which expanded its mandate as part of President Richard Nixon’s “War on Cancer.” Three of four of the cancer institute’s research dollars go to outside scientists, with most of the remainder funding more than 300 scientists on campus.
And Congress was generous. Harold Varmus, one of more than 40 Nobel laureates whose work was funded by NCI, said budgets were usually handsome when he was NIH director from 1993 through 1999. President Bill Clinton “would say to me, ‘I’d like to give you a bigger increase, Harold, but your friends in Congress will bring it up.’ He’d offer me a 5% increase,” Varmus recalled, but “I’d end up getting more like 10%” from Congress.
Congress appropriated $2 billion to NCI in fiscal 1993. By 2025, funding had risen to $7.22 billion.
Rat on your colleagues
During a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff members, Jay Bhattacharya, the institute’s new director, equivocated when asked about funding cuts for research into improving the health of racial and ethnic minorities — cuts made under the guise of purging DEI from the government.
According to a recording of the meeting obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the agency remained “absolutely committed to advancing the health and well-being of every population, including minority populations, LGBTQ populations, and every population.”
Research addressing the health needs of women and minorities is “an absolute priority of mine,” he said. “We’re going to keep funding that.” But a study considering whether “structural racism causes poor health in minority populations” is “not a scientific hypothesis.”
“We need scientific ideas that are actionable, that improve the health and well-being of people, not ideological ideas that don’t have any chance of improving the health and well-being of people,” he said. That comment angered many staffers, several said in interviews. Many got up and walked out during the speech, while others, watching remotely, scoffed or jeered.
Several current and former NCI scientists questioned Bhattacharya’s commitment to young scientists and minorities. Staffing cuts early in the year eliminated many recently hired NCI scientists. At least 172 National Cancer Institute grants, including for research aimed at minimizing health disparities among racial minorities or LGBTQ+ people, were terminated and hadn’t been reinstated as of June 16, according to a KFF Health News analysis of HHS documents and a list of grant terminations by outside researchers.
Those populations have higher rates of certain cancer diagnoses and are more likely to receive diagnoses later than white or heterosexual people. Black people are also more likely to die of many cancer types than all other racial and ethnic groups.
Jennifer Guida, a researcher who focuses on accelerated aging in cancer survivors, said she recently left NCI after a decade in part because of the administration’s DEI orders. According to several workers and internal emails viewed by KFF Health News, those included an HHS edict in January to report their colleagues who worked on such issues, and flagging grants that included DEI-related terms because they didn’t align with Trump’s priorities.
‘I’m not going to put my name attached to that. I don’t stand for that. It’s not OK,” said Guida, who added that it amounted to a “scrubbing of science.”
Racial discrimination is one factor that contributes to accelerated aging. “There are a growing number of cancer survivors in the U.S.,” Guida said, and “a significant number of those people who will become cancer survivors are racial and ethnic minorities.”
“Those people deserve to be studied,” she said. “How can you help those people if you’re not even studying them?”
In May, NCI informed leaders of the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity, a program that links 14 large U.S. cancer centers with minority-serving colleges and universities, that their funding would be cut. The project’s Notice of Funding Opportunity — the mechanism the government uses to award grants — had been suddenly taken offline, meaning NCI staffers couldn’t award future funding, according to three sources and internal communications viewed by KFF Health News. These “unpublishings” have often occurred without warning, explanation, or even notification of the grantee that no more money would be coming.
The cancer partnerships have trained more than 8,500 scientists. They’re designed to address widely documented disparities in cancer care by having top medical schools place students from rural, poor, and minority-serving schools and community clinics in research, training, and outreach.
Research shows that patients from racial and ethnic minorities receive better medical care and have improved outcomes when their clinicians share their background.
“I’m from an immigrant family, the first to graduate in my family,” said Elena Martinez, a professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California-San Diego, who leads one of the partnerships with colleagues at largely Hispanic Cal State-San Diego. “I wouldn’t be here without this kind of program, and there won’t be people like me here in the future if we cut these programs.”
Silencing the science communicators
In early April, when the dust settled after mass firings across HHS, workers in NCI’s communications office were relieved they still had their jobs.
It didn’t last. A month later, HHS fired nearly all of them, three former workers said. Combined with retirements and other departures, a skeleton crew of six or seven remain of about 75 people. “We were all completely blindsided,” a fired worker said. NCI leadership “had no idea that this was happening.”
As a result, websites, newsletters, and other resources for patients and doctors about the latest evidence in cancer treatment aren’t being updated. They include Cancer.gov and NCI’s widely used Physician Data Query, which compile research findings that doctors turn to when caring for cancer patients.
Gary Kreps, founding director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University, said he relied on Physician Data Query when his father was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer, taking PDQ printouts when he met with his dad’s doctors. “It made a huge difference,” Kreps said. “He ended up living, like, another three years” — longer than expected — “and enjoyed the rest of his life.”
As of May 30, banners at the top of the Cancer.gov and PDQ websites said, “Due to HHS restructuring and reduction in workforce efforts, the information on this website may not be up to date and pages will indicate as such.” The banners are gone, but neither website was being updated, according to a fired worker with knowledge of the situation.
Outdated PDQ information is “really very dangerous,” Kreps said.
Wiping out NCI’s communications staff makes it harder to share complex and ever-changing information that doctors and patients need, said Peter Garrett, who headed NCI’s communications before retiring in May. Garrett said he left because of concerns about political interference.
“The science isn’t finished until it’s communicated,” he said. “Without the government playing that role, who’s going to step in?”
A budget To ‘destroy clinical research’
Following court decisions that blocked some NIH grant cancellations or rendered them “void” and “illegal,” NIH official Michelle Bulls in late June told staffers to stop terminating grants. However, NCI workers told KFF Health News they continue to review grants flagged by NIH to assess whether they align with Trump administration priorities. Courts have ordered NIH to reinstate some terminated grants, but not all of them.
At NCI and across NIH, staffers remain anxious.
The White House wants Congress to slash the cancer institute’s budget by nearly 40%, to $4.53 billion, as part of a larger proposal to sharply reduce NIH’s fiscal 2026 coffers.
Bhattacharya has said he wants NIH to fund more big, breakthrough research. Major cuts could have the opposite effect, Knudsen said. When NCI funding shrinks, “it’s the safe science that tends to get funded, not the science that is game changing and has the potential to be transformative for cures.”
Usually the president’s budget is dead on arrival in Congress, and members of both parties have expressed doubt about Trump’s 2026 proposal. But agency workers, outside scientists, and patients fear this one may stick, with devastating impact.
It would force NCI to suspend all new grants or cut existing grants so severely that the gaps will close many labs, said Varmus, who ran NCI from 2010 to 2015. Add that to the impact on NCI’s contracts, clinical trials, internal research, and salaries, he said, and “you can reliably say that NCI will be unable to keep up in any way with the promise of science that’s currently underway.”
The NCI laboratory chief, who has worked at the institute for decades, put it this way: “If the 40% budget cut passes in Congress, it will destroy clinical research at NCI.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mark Flynn: Safe parking at Perkins Pier in Burlington, dead on arrival.","This commentary is by Mark Flynn of Williston. Now a homeowner, he was formerly housing insecure in Burlington.


Most Burlingtonians know Perkins Pier is a marina where live-aboard-sized sailboats and similar sized pleasure boats are kept (with some inhabitants aboard). It is a wealthy neighborhood by outward appearance. 
That said, nearly every homeless person in Burlington has visited this scenic park. The bike path is well traveled particularly by them. The fear driving the NIMBYism and hatred that quashed the “Safe Overnight Parking pilot project” practically overnight before it began can hardly be called unexpected.

The park’s locked passcode-restricted restrooms delivered the message of privilege to the poor before the pandemic. Likewise, the restriction on overnight parking except for the wealthy sleeping and living in the not-so-public park.
Property crime was not on the verge of dramatic change. The have-nots have long known what is there, what is all too apparent, a contrast in social class and privilege in glaring public view. 
The destitute have been there and are there now. But at the margins, in the shrubbery, in the midst of the odor and noise of the adjacent sewer plant and railyard. The feared increase in public disturbance is unlikely. It already occurs.
The stress of dire poverty is immense. The formal permission to park offered refuge with less persecution, more calm and more predictability to shattered lives. Instead we have increased, not reduced, the disturbing cries for help borne of pain and suffering which shall now be more likely in your neighborhood. 
The most cost-effective government program to reduce poverty is a driver’s license. The most counterproductive policies are irrational stigma, confiscations of dwellings (tents/vehicles) without trial, and denial of supportive medical care to prevent emergency care.
As a community we need to own that the levers of power were pulled by politics more in keeping with MAGA than Bernie.As for the modest proposal of inclusion to also allow the poorest to sleep within the park boundary in nontraditional dwellings, it is doubtful these luxury boat owners will read “A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift. Nonetheless I hold that satirical mirror up to the rest of our community.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pelin Kohn: A values-based response to homelessness in Vermont.","This commentary is by Pelin Kohn, a Montpelier city councilor.


Homelessness is not a local issue. It’s a Vermont issue.
Towns and cities across the state are grappling with a growing crisis — one that reflects not just economic hardship, but the moral core of our communities. Montpelier, like many others, is doing everything it can to respond with compassion and urgency. But the truth is undeniable: no municipality — no matter how committed — can solve this crisis alone.

Leadership isn’t just about policy. It’s about values. It’s about seeing the humanity in every neighbor — housed or unhoused — and making decisions grounded in justice, dignity and shared responsibility.
A statewide moral challenge
The recent cutbacks in Vermont’s emergency motel housing program did more than close doors — it exposed a gap between what we say we value and how we act. The program wasn’t perfect, but it was a lifeline for hundreds. Its abrupt end for many people left communities scrambling to respond — without the tools, funding or coordinated strategy to succeed.
This isn’t just about governance. It’s about people. When families sleep in cars, tents line our rivers, and shelters are forced to turn people away — we must ask: where are our values when they’re needed most?
What communities are doing — and why it’s not enough
In Montpelier, we’ve responded with policies that prioritize health over punishment, strong partnerships with service providers and investments in affordable housing. We’ve advocated regionally and acted locally.
But like so many Vermont towns, we’re stretching limited resources to meet growing needs. Communities are doing their part. But the systems meant to support them are stretched too thin. This crisis demands more than local response — it requires statewide responsibility. 
A call for statewide moral action
The Vermont Civic Health Index shows that residents trust local government more than national government — but they’re losing faith that any level of leadership is truly acting on shared values. That erosion isn’t apathy. It’s frustration. It’s the quiet heartbreak of watching systems fail the most vulnerable among us.
To move from crisis to commitment, Vermont must reinvest in emergency shelter, expand supportive housing and mental health services and make decisions guided by values — not just budgets — because lives are at stake.
Let’s be the Vermont we say we are
“Vermont values” must be more than a slogan. If we truly stand for equity, justice and community, then we must act like it — especially when people’s survival depends on it. Many towns are doing what they can. But no municipality can carry this burden alone. We need a coordinated, compassionate, statewide response — rooted in courage, integrity and our collective will.
Because at the end of the day, this isn’t about policy memos or budget lines. It’s about people. People living in cars behind grocery stores. Parents keeping children warm in tents along frozen rivers. Seniors choosing between medication and a motel room.
If we continue to treat homelessness as someone else’s problem, we will keep failing those who need us most. 
Leadership means refusing to look away. Now is the time for Vermont to lead — not with fear, not with spreadsheets, but with conviction, compassion and moral clarity. That’s the Vermont we believe in. It’s time to prove it.

Mike Braun speaks to reporters on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, in Indianapolis. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After catastrophic flooding in Texas killed dozens and forced thousands from their homes, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said the Hoosier State must reassess how it communicates emergency warnings and coordinates disaster response.
Braun called the deadly Texas floods a “wake-up call” and said states — including Indiana — should examine whether emergency response systems have any “weaknesses.”
“I think it brings to light, where you’ve got that discussion, ‘Are there enough resources for something as tragic as that?’ You’ve got to set a lot of it aside, get through it, focus on what’s most important, and then come back and see if there are any things you can do better,” the governor told reporters on Wednesday.










We have our own calamities, through tornadoes and flooding — thank goodness, nothing of that magnitude — but we all need to be prepared. I think it's a time to learn from it and see what (we can) do better, collectively.


– Gov. Mike Braun


The torrential floods have exposed shortcomings in emergency preparedness and public warning systems. Despite receiving flash flood warnings from the National Weather Service, numerous Texas residents and officials reported little to no alerts from local systems. 
The area lacks its own audible alert infrastructure — like sirens or low-water crossing alarms — and even when federal flash flood warnings were issued, they often failed to reach vulnerable populations, The Texas Tribune reported. 
Mass notification systems sent sporadic messages — hampered by spotty cell reception, muted phones, and campsites where children didn’t carry devices. That left thousands of people unaware as river levels exploded. Many alerts didn’t arrive until after homes started to flood.
‘Time to learn’ how Indiana can strengthen emergency responses
Braun said the warnings, or lack thereof, in Texas raise questions about how Indiana and other states coordinate emergency responses and communicate life-saving warnings to the public.
“Here in our own state, I’m going to be cognizant of it,” he continued. “We have our own calamities, through tornadoes and flooding — thank goodness, nothing of that magnitude — but we all need to be prepared. I think it’s a time to learn from it and see what [we can] do better, collectively.”
Asked whether he would push for a formal review of how Indiana’s Department of Homeland Security works with the Federal Emergency Management Agency — as well as local entities — to distribute warnings and prepare for emergencies, Braun expressed interest but said he’s not ready to propose specific changes.
“That, to me, is going to be an easy dynamic,” he said. “We just need to look into it to see if we’ve got any weaknesses, so that we’re prepared [for] whatever might happen eventually. I don’t have anything prescriptive out there yet, but I think this is an eye-opener for a lot of governors across the country.”
Indiana sends search and rescue help
Indiana Task Force One, a highly trained team of first responders and one of 28 federal squads across the country, was deployed Tuesday evening to assist with search and rescue operations in Kerr County, Texas. The 49-member team will stage in San Antonio before heading to areas impacted by flooding.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday there are more than 160 people believed to be missing in the floods.
We’re going to always try to help — even when, logistically, that’s a long distance to go,” Braun said. 
Federal funding uncertainty eliminates Indiana programs, threatens others

“We’ve got special skills when it comes to watercraft and that kind of rescue,” he added. “We thought it made sense, due to the horrendous nature of what they’re dealing with.”
The deployment follows longstanding mutual aid agreements among states to assist one another during major disasters.
But it also comes at a time when emergency preparedness programs in Indiana are facing strain. 
State officials have warned that delays and uncertainty around federal funding could threaten the continuity of several emergency preparedness programs, including Task Force One.
While the task force is funded through a $1.3 million federal grant and administered by the city of Indianapolis, the state does not currently provide any direct financial support. 
Hoosier lawmakers declined to appropriate dollars for Task Force One in the state budget earlier this year, which could jeopardize the team’s ability to deploy for emergencies.
FEMA requires the task force to maintain at least 210 people on a rotating schedule who are ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Two-thirds of the unit is made up of firefighters with 380 hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more.
The other members are physicians, structural engineers, canine handlers, logistics operatives and even licensed CDL drivers who transport equipment like rescue boats, ready-to-eat meals, water tanks and dry suits.

But the DEP has been dragging its feet about cleaning up pollution in the springs, despite a state law requiring it be done. (Via Florida State Parks)Florida’s springs are one of the natural wonders of our state. As a result, I naturally wonder why the government agency in charge of protecting them thinks it’s OK to let them become cesspools of pollution and toxic algae.
What’s worse is that they’re violating a state law commanding a cleanup.
I’ve been following this strange case for several years, so I was startled last week to see a story reported by WUFT-FM that said, “State adopts revised plans to improve water quality.”
The plans for the springs “identify sources of nitrogen and phosphorus including agriculture, septic tanks and urban fertilizers and set long-term goals for reducing their impacts,” the radio station noted.
Well, I thought, it’s about time!
See, the state Department of Environmental Protection was supposed to have adopted these plans in 2017, thus starting a cleanup that would be finished 20 years from that date.
Instead, they kept putting it off and putting it off, each time announcing they were giving themselves one more year to comply with the state law commanding a springs cleanup.
Nobody ever punished the DEP for repeatedly breaking the law, so the agency just kept doing it.
That’s why, when I saw the story about these new springs regulations, I was all set to congratulate the DEP on finally achieving those long-delayed goals. But then I talked to some springs experts and found out that it’s just more foot-dragging like before.
Turns out protecting our springs is not as important as protecting the politically powerful polluters.
  Ryan Smart via Linkedin
“DEP is not following the law in order to give polluters an out,” said Ryan Smart of the Florida Springs Council. “When we get to the 20-year mark, I’m afraid we’re going to be worse off than when we started.”
 Mermaids, monkeys and the Black Lagoon
Here’s a cool Florida fact: This state contains more first-magnitude springs than anywhere else on Earth. “First magnitude” refers to how much water gushes out of them.
Several of the springs are owned by us taxpayers because they’re part of the state park system. For instance, there’s Wakulla Springs, renowned as “the world’s largest and deepest freshwater spring,” where a movie crew filmed “The Creature from the Black Lagoon.”
There’s Silver Springs, famed for its glass-bottomed boats and its roaming monkeys.
And we can’t forget Weeki Wachee Springs, where the list of government jobs includes “mermaid.”
Early accounts of our springs are credited with inspiring Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s famous poem about Kubla Khan, which speaks of a sacred river running through “caverns measureless to man.”
Another well-known writer, Everglades doyenne Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, dubbed the springs “bowls of liquid light,” Biologist and diver Doug Stamm, in his recent book “The Springs of Florida,” calls them “wondrous blue jewels.” Both descriptions seem accurate to me.
Our springs were our earliest tourist attraction. Northern visitors poured in here because medical hucksters succeeded in pushing a sit-and-soak as a cure-all.
  Weeki Wachee Springs has mermaid shows. (Via Florida State Parks)
But the most important thing to know about our springs is that they’re windows.
When you gaze into the depths of a Florida spring, you’re looking into our underground aquifer, the source of 90% of our drinking supply. If the springs become tainted, so does the water we drink.
Right now, these windows are dirty and getting progressively dirtier.
 Getting ESP
It’s not hard to figure out what’s gone wrong with our springs.
Too much pumping from the aquifer — to irrigate golf courses, boost crops, and provide lush suburban lawns — has lowered the pressure pushing these ancient fountains out of the “caverns measureless to man.”
Meanwhile, excess fertilizer, leaky sewage pipes, and malfunctioning septic tanks keep dumping nitrates into the mix, spurring the growth of toxic algae that resembles — but does not taste like — guacamole.
Alarmed by the trend, in 2016 some very persistent springs supporters persuaded the Legislature to pass a law called “The Florida Springs and Aquifer Protection Act.” The law designated 30 of the state’s springs as “Outstanding Florida Springs,” which means they are such Florida treasures that they deserve ESP — extra special protection.
If any of those 30 springs become impaired by pollution, the law said, then the DEP had to get them cleaned up within 20 years. Turned out, 24 of the 30 made the polluted list.
The law gave the DEP until 2017 to figure out how to start cleaning them up. Instead, in 2017, the agency granted itself more time to come up with new rules. Then they did it again in 2018. And 2019. And 2020. And … you get the idea.
Meanwhile, year after year, the springs’ conditions got worse and worse.
“Instead of shrinking, contaminants grew,” the WUFT-FM story reported. “Between 2016 and 2024, nitrogen increased by about 1.5 million pounds per year on average in impaired outstanding springs.”
In fact, Smart told me, not only has the DEP not cleaned up the 24, but the list of contaminated waterways now includes a 25th spring.
 Plans to do nothing
The big issue, once again, is what the DEP calls Basin Management Action Plans. Each is supposed to address the pollution in a specific water body, reducing it until it’s no longer a problem. But when the Florida Springs Council studied the first set of springs plans that the DEP produced, it found that they would reduce, at best, only a tiny bit of pollution.
The plans also failed to include any consideration for Florida’s growing population, instead acting like the population would simply freeze. Plus, their provisions were entirely voluntary. Polluters could follow them or not — it was up to them.
There was another problem, too. DEP was supposed to use the plans to spell out exactly how much nitrogen pollution should be reduced from which sources.
But the DEP chose to not include any such specifics. Instead, the agency inserted a pie-chart of pollution sources that didn’t name any names. It was as if they had guaranteed the polluters anonymity.
The springs council partnered with the Save the Manatee Club, the Sierra Club, and several other environmental groups and sued. They lost at the trial court level, but then, in 2023, four years after the suit was filed, an appeals court ruled in their favor.

“To be effective and have any teeth, BMAPs have to show who’s causing the most pollution, where polluters or the state need to do more, and how much reduction is needed,” their attorney, John Thomas, said in a press release at the time. “That’s what the ruling requires.”
So here we are two years after that ruling and six years after the suit was first filed, and the DEP has now announced its new plans with all the verve of P.T. Barnum unveiling his next act.
In a press release, the agency called the new plans “a science-driven, adaptive framework for reducing nutrient pollution in Florida’s rivers, lakes, estuaries, springs and aquifers” that were “developed in collaboration with local governments, state agencies, utilities and other key stakeholders.”

And the DEP’s recently appointed secretary, Alexis Lambert, called this “a significant milestone made possible through input, collaboration and dedication.”
Bob Knight has been studying Florida’s springs longer than any other scientist alive. Not long ago, he retired as the head of the Howard T. Odom Florida Springs Institute.
I called him to see what he thought about these new plans. The answer was: Not much.
“A lot of staff time and resources goes into BMAPs to give the appearance of thorough science,” Knight told me. “But otherwise, they’re just a smokescreen to let big ag and urban development continue their polluting enterprises.”
As with the earlier plans that led to the lawsuit, he said, everything is “pretty much voluntary instead of required. That means there’s no chance of the BMAPs helping.”
For instance, Knight said, the dairies in North Florida are a major source of pollution flowing into the springs. “What are the BMAPs requiring the dairies to do? Nothing.”
 Keep hope alive
In a way, I suppose none of this should be a surprise.
Since 2019, the DEP has been under the control of Gov. Ron DeSantis. You know, the guy who thinks state parks are a good place to build golf courses and the Everglades is the perfect spot to put a concentration camp.
Remember back when he was first elected? He’d promised to do something about our growing problem of toxic algae blooms. He got off to a good start, appointing a panel of scientists to recommend what to do.
Then he ignored most of the report’s recommendations. 
Instead, he cut a secretive deal with an Israeli company to dump a hydrogen peroxide mixture on the algae. That makes it go away for a little while — but then it comes right back.
Smart told me he and his colleagues haven’t yet decided what to do about this latest DEP failure to launch. They’ve spent years fighting the state in court and meanwhile the springs just keep declining in water quality. What’s the solution?
Maybe the springs advocates should publicly announce that they’re applying for aid from First Lady Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida charity.
Sure, the charity is mired in scandal and it’s even facing a criminal investigation. But the whole point of Hope Florida is to help people in need of government assistance, and that’s clearly what our springs need but cannot get.
Hope Florida has also shown itself to be, um, er, let’s say “resourceful” when it comes to handling millions of dollars, and I think that’s what it will take to clean up these jewels.
“When you call the Hope Line, you take the first step towards accomplishing the American Dream,” the Hope Florida website says.
What’s more important to the American Dream than having clean water to drink?

July 9, 2025. | ScreenshotWith President Donald Trump’s administration once again pushing back its deadline for negotiating new international trade deals, small business owners — including a Detroit boutique owner  — voiced their concerns on a Wednesday press call, outlining how continued uncertainty around global trade had impacted their business. 
While July 9 was supposed to mark the end of the administration’s 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs announced in April, the administration has since extended the pause until Aug. 1, breeding further uncertainty for businesses looking to adapt to increased import costs and changing international trade dynamics. 
Aaron Lehman, an Iowa Farmer and president of the Iowa Farmers Union kicked off the call, organized by Tariffs Cost US and Farmers for Free Trade, by underscoring how tariffs are increasing costs across the U.S. economy, threatening growth for local businesses. 
“Tariff policies aren’t abstract. They’re affecting real people, real businesses and real nations. This uncertainty is costing businesses and consumers by the minute,” Lehman said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
From family farmers to the owner of a Missouri-based spirits company, business owners from across multiple states offered their perspectives on how the ongoing threat of tariffs had affected their business as well as their international trade partners.  
Rachel Lutz, the owner of The Peacock Room in Detroit, said she started her business by maxing out a $1,500 credit card, and had since grown to generating $1.5 million in revenue a year, creating 12 to 14 jobs. 
Lutz’s boutiques, located in the Fisher Building as well as The Park Shelton in Midtown, sell mostly women’s apparel and accessories. While they sell a mixture of domestic-made and internationally-produced garments, she noted that 97% of clothing on the U.S. market is made overseas. 
“I’m really proud to carry both U.S.-made, Canadian-made clothing, as well as imported, but even those producers have really been rattled by these tariffs, and it’s affecting them, which then affects me,” Lutz said. 
Many of the U.S.-based clothing manufacturers whose goods appear in Lutz’s shops use imported fabrics due to the lack of textile mills in the U.S. Lutz said.
  Business owners gather on a press call to share how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have impacted their operations. July 9, 2025 | Screenshot
“It’s not like you can just wave a magic wand and restart them.…So they’re facing price increases, even though it’s a U.S. label,” she said. 
Meanwhile, a Canadian vendor who Lutz said she does hundreds of thousands of dollars in business with, has been absorbing the 25% tariff levied on Canadian goods since springtime. 
Lutz said she carries products from overseas to give a wide price range to her customers, noting that she serves a very mixed-income neighborhood in the city.
“As a small business, we are competing against big, big players that ahead of the tariffs going into effect, they were able to ship massive amounts of inventory, warehouse them to buffer their impact from these tariffs. Small businesses like mine don’t have that capability. We don’t have those large pockets of capital to draw upon” Lutz said, emphasizing that small businesses are particularly vulnerable to tariffs levied on consumer goods. 
Additionally, tariffs have made planning difficult, Lutz said, noting that after she’d ordered her Christmas inventory in January and February, she received a flood of notices from the more than 100 vendors she carried, each with a different response to the tariff announcements that she needed to keep track of. 
“Now, as I’m going to trade shows, I’m trying to buy inventory for next January, next February, and I can’t even figure out what the pricing will be, and my vendors don’t know either,” Lutz said, noting that one vendor she worked with based in the United Kingdom, whose goods were made in China, had opted to pull out of the U.S. market entirely. 
Additionally, Lutz said she’s had to absorb the costs of tariffs in order to keep her prices competitive as she faces off with online retailers and lower consumer confidence, meaning people are shopping less as they look toward an uncertain economic future. 
After opening her business on the heels of the Great Recession and surviving three years of street construction and five years of post-pandemic change in this business environment, Lutz said it feels like she’s facing an arbitrary and manufactured crisis.
“This is not something that is not within our control to fix. It’s not something that’s not within the lawmakers control to fix, and I want lawmakers to know this is affecting real people,” Lutz said. “I don’t have a partner in my business. This is jobs at stake. This is consumer choice at stake. This is consumer pricing at stake. And this is just a way to further disadvantage small businesses against big businesses.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-2.15.14 PM.png,,,2025-07-10 07:08:50.373148

Data shows that many of those in immigration detention have no criminal history. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Thirty-four cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda.
The expansion of the case could be a sign that more cities are seeing the benefit of suing to protect their rights in court from a Trump administration that is often acting without regard for legal precedent. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits nationwide injunctions means that cities and states must be part of a lawsuit to get the benefits of any injunction that would stop such policies while the legal merits are debated in court.
The federal judge in the case, William Orrick of the U.S. District Court of Northern California, did issue an injunction April 24, telling the Trump administration it couldn’t use executive orders to withhold federal funding from the original 15 cities and counties in the lawsuit. Orrick updated the injunction June 23 to include later policy memos tying “all new federal awards” to immigration compliance. The Trump administration said it would appeal the injunction.
“It appears that the defendants continue to seek an end run around the preliminary injunction,” Orrick wrote in June. Orrick left the door open for the administration to withhold funds directly tied to illegal immigration, but he said the administration still must make a case that there’s a real connection between immigration and other issues — especially with seemingly unrelated programs like highway and housing funds.
If the new cities and counties are accepted into the lawsuit, there would be a total of 50 localities in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
The Supreme Court decision in Trump v. CASA, limiting nationwide injunctions, now “creates more impetus in this litigation and in others for more parties to seek relief to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
Generally, the local sanctuary policies at stake are those that limit cooperation with “detainers” asking local law enforcement authorities to hold arrested people in jail up to two days after they would otherwise go free, on behalf of federal immigration investigations. Some states and localities limit cooperation with the detainers, and some require cooperation.
“[Trump officials] are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting local governments to do their bidding and this case is pushback against that,” Miller said. “Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.”
In a March filing, attorneys for the Trump administration defended the planned funding cutoffs as part of the president’s Jan. 20 executive order to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’ which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.”
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, in a response to a reporter’s question that was posted July 8 by the White House, said the administration is determined than ever to go after cities that don’t fully cooperate.
“We’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because they’re a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is,” Homan said. “We know they’re releasing public safety threats.”
According to June numbers obtained by the TRAC data clearinghouse at the University of Syracuse, nearly 44% of people held in immigration detention have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses such as traffic violations. The rest were detained based on pending charges or purely immigration-related offenses such as crossing the border in secret.

Pat Williams has died. He was Montana’s longest serving Congressman, serving from 1979 to 1997. He had a sense of justice and values which he defended proudly and vigorously, often in the face of strong and outraged opposition. 
He was my political hero.
He was a teacher and he used that skill to educate the voter on his positions and why his positions were their positions. He was one of the best and most convincing speakers I ever listened to. 
And he had a smile.
I first met him when I was in the Montana House of Representatives, and he was in Congress. He was in Sanders County for an event and I offered to drive him to it in my 1970 Buick Electra—the one with the big engine. He got in and I offered him a cigar. We lit up and drove to the event in comfort and conversation.
I once expressed my surprise to him at how many introverts were in politics. 
“Yes,” he said, “and I’m one of them!” 
Inconceivable, I thought, because he was so gregarious, so he told me a story, he was good at that, it was his stock in trade.
When he first decided to run for the Montana House of Representatives he was talking to an influential member of the Butte community (all people from Butte are influential members of the community, but this one held a political office). Pat was speaking to him in front of a storefront, quietly, and as they were talking the man steered him to the middle of the sidewalk and began to speak in a loud voice, “So, Pat, you say you’re running for the Legislature” thereby announcing to the passers-by what Pat was too shy to do. The lesson was that you had to shout your ambitions from the rooftops and be bold about it.
I believe it was right after that encounter that Pat was walking home and saw a group of men working on a roof. There was a ladder, and Pat climbed up to the bemused workmen and said, “Hi, I’m Pat Williams and I’m running to represent Butte in the Montana Legislature,” shaking hands all around.
He was tireless in his support for women and young people in politics. He knew that decision making should not be exclusive to older men. He supported working people, free speech and justice under the law. He not only believed in those things, he fought for them. He fought hard and he loved a battle.
And it was never just Pat. Like Mike Mansfield who insisted that any recognition he was given always included his wife Maureen, it was always Pat and Carol. At another event in Sanders County, Paul Clark, Carol’s seatmate in the Montana House said he would introduce Carol to the audience. “No, Paul, I will introduce Carol,” said Pat. 
And he always did. 
He loved Montana as he loved his family.
He believed in the law and he believed in honor, and he believed in the people he served.
He stood by us; he stood with us. 
Thank you, Pat. Thank you, Carol.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pat_butte-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-07-10 07:08:50.373148

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty ImagesHoosier farmers planted about 1.6 million acres of overwinter living covers – cover crops and small grains, like wheat – this spring, elevating the state to the top in the nation in cover crop adoption, according to a survey by the Indiana State Department of Agriculture. 
The conservation survey, conducted between March and May, recorded 651,000 acres of corn and 916,000 acres of soybean covering the state. 
Posey County led the state with about 87,000 acres under cover crops, followed by Gibson County with 70,000 acres and LaPorte County with 60,000 acres. 
“Hoosier farmers are committed to preserving one of God’s most (precious) gifts – Earth,” Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith said in a press release. “Overwintering covers are just one tool that farmers use to preserve and enhance our farmland — ensuring they can pass down their property for generations. This is no easy task, and it can be costly. I applaud them for the extra effort.”
Farmers plant cover crops after the fall harvest to keep roots in the ground throughout the winter. They help build organic matter in the soil, improve overall soil health and reduce erosion. Some, such as legumes, also act as natural fertilizers. Cover crops have grown to cover more acreage in Indiana than any other commodity crop apart from corn and soybeans. 
Acres of Living Green Cover Planted
 
The survey estimates that cover crops helped prevent 1.8 million tons of sediment from entering Indiana’s waterways — enough to fill about 18,000 train freight cars. According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, constructing roads, buildings and the moving earth can cause sediment to enter waterways – making sediment the number one water quality pollutant in Indiana. 
The survey also revealed that 70% of row crop acres were untilled — a method where crops are planted directly in residue of the previous crop. Additionally 18% had used reduced tillage over winter following the 2024 harvest. 
Last year, Hoosier farmers broke the conservation record, planting 1.7 million acres under living cover. 
The Indiana Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, who assisted in conducting the survey, was among the many hit by federal funding freezes. The federal funding freezes left the Allen County district in turmoil – hurting operations and terminating an employee.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/corn-700x468-1.jpg,,,2025-07-10 07:08:50.373148

(Getty Images) Visitors to the Idaho Division of Human Resources’s website can get quick answers from a new chatbot — powered by artificial intelligence, or AI — that combs through state government websites.
So, we asked it: “How many state employees does Idaho have?”
The chatbot’s answer didn’t make sense. The tool falsely claimed nearly a third of Idaho’s over 2 million population works for the state.
  (Screenshot)
“Idaho has approximately 713,015 state employees as indicated by the most recent data available,” the chatbot replied.
The right answer, though, depends on how you ask the question.
When you ask more specifically about how many “active” state employees there are, Idaho HR Administrator Janelle White explained, you can get a better answer.
“Idaho currently has approximately 23,546 active state employees employed across various government agencies,” the chatbot replied, according to a screenshot she shared with the Idaho Capital Sun.
The chatbot is one of the few ways Idaho state government agencies are already using AI. But with high interest — and concern — from state agencies and employees, Idaho’s Office of Information Technology Services is preparing a yearslong plan with guidance on how to responsibly use AI in state government.
“While we’re measuring and mitigating risks, we’re making sure that we’re not getting in the way of it being launched. We want to — we really want to unleash this to the workforce,” Idaho Office of Information Technology Services Administrator Alberto Gonzalez said in an interview. “I’m a huge fan of automation and machine learning already anyways, because it can make government way more effective and more efficient. And I believe that those that are not using automation are doing a disservice to the state.”

 By August, Idaho agencies could start using tools like ChatGPT

By August, Gonzalez said Idaho state government agencies can start using publicly available tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in public facing chatbots, which have been largely blocked.

To him, the use cases for AI in state government are “endless.” The technology can be used for routine tasks, like customer service and data entry, to quicken time-intensive reports, and even to detect fraud, waste and abuse, he said. 
One of the biggest AI concerns for state employees is how widely data can be accessed, or data governance, Gonzalez said. That’s part of what goes into the IT office’s work with state agencies to prepare them to roll out AI tools.
Some national experts also say AI could reduce the workforce. That could be true, Gonzalez acknowledged, but it would take a while.
Using the technology more could mean agencies automate more tasks to free staff time up, he said. “So then you can use that staff to do something — either slow down the growth, so that you don’t have to grow government … or potentially through attrition, you could reduce the workforce by leveraging AI,” Gonzalez said. 
“I know that that’s a more sensitive topic, but I’m talking over years,” he said. 
Last month, the agency announced the guidance to state lawmakers at the Idaho Legislature’s AI Working Group. But the guidance hasn’t been shared with agencies yet while it’s under legal review. The Idaho Capital Sun obtained a copy of the draft guidance through a public records request. 
 Idaho would carefully roll out, refine AI tools over two years, under draft plan

The draft AI guidance lays out a four-step plan — over two years — to implement AI in Idaho state government agencies.
Survey: Some Idaho government agencies use artificial intelligence already. More may follow.

First, Idaho would set up a foundation — establishing structures to govern AI use, roles for state agencies and departments, oversight and more. 
Then, Idaho would initially implement AI in pilot runs. Later, Idaho would expand implementation and continue to fine tune AI’s use in state government. 
“Idaho’s tiered guidance model applies rigorous scrutiny to high-risk systems and streamlines review for low-risk applications,” the draft guidance’s introduction reads. “This structure empowers the state to capture immediate value from early implementations and build institutional capacity systematically. Through this balanced approach, Idaho is poised to transform its citizen services, operational workflows, and decision-making culture, anchoring it in data-driven insights and public accountability.”
And building trust is one of the main goals.
“Every AI system will meet clear standards for explainability, auditability, and ethical alignment,” a short summary of the guidance reads. “Transparency isn’t optional, it’s foundational.”
 Congress ditched 10-year ban on state AI regulations. Idaho has three AI laws. 

Initially, Congress’s massive federal spending and tax cut bill that became law last week would’ve blocked states from regulating AI through state laws for 10 years. But the U.S. Senate nearly unanimously removed the moratorium, States Newsroom reported.
In 2024, Idaho passed three laws to regulate AI — targeting explicit and political deep fakes, and AI-generated material that is exploitative of children.
At the Legislature’s AI work group’s meeting last month, the Idaho Office of Information Technology Services shared copies of its draft AI guidance with state lawmakers for review. 
 The Idaho HR AI chatbot still can’t tell you the number of state employees 

For the rollout of the public HR chatbot, the Idaho Division of Human Resources worked with the Office of Information Technology Services, White told the Sun. 
The Sun sent her a screenshot of the chatbot appearing to wildly overestimate Idaho’s state employee workforce. She, and the Idaho DMV administrator, both suggested they would’ve asked it differently — with more specific details, like asking for the active workforce.
“The information provided by the chatbot will only be as good as the question asked [and the information it has access to],” White said in an email on Monday. “… Part of the learning curve with AI and chatbots, is being really good at asking questions!”
  (Screenshot)
But on Tuesday, when the Sun asked the chatbot the same question White asked, the chatbot couldn’t answer.
“I don’t have the current number of active state employees available,” it said. 
 Idaho DMV is using an AI chatbot. But only for internal testing right now.

The Idaho Department of Motor Vehicles, or DMV, is also using an AI-powered chatbot as part of a pilot project. But the tool is only available for some DMV employees to use for testing — and is not yet open to the public, officials say.
It won’t go public until it’s refined, Idaho DMV Administrator Lisa McClellan told the Sun in an interview. 
“Until it’s ready for prime time, we won’t even use it internally in our production environment,” she said.
Drawing from internal policy documents, manuals and Idaho state laws, the tool is meant to quicken the process of searching through reams of information, she explained. The tool doesn’t have access to any personally identifiable information, she said. 
Only a handful of ITD employees, who mostly already know the answers to the questions they ask the tool, are using it, McClellan said. Right now, they’re testing how accurate its answers are, and learning how to best ask questions to get correct answers, she said.

Buffalo’s Mountain Meadow Wool operates the largest full-service wool mill in the West.
The post Knitting a future for Wyoming wool appeared first on WyoFile .","There is a gray, nondescript building off Highway 16 in Buffalo that is tucked behind other gray, nondescript buildings. If not for the two sheep that live in a north-facing pen adjacent to the structure, you might never have a clue what’s inside. 
Those two sheep are named Yarnold and Lambert, and they are owned by Karen Hostetler, who also owns the tucked-away building off the highway, which — despite its unassuming appearance — houses the West’s largest full-service wool mill. 
The mill is named Mountain Meadow Wool, and its goal and purpose, Hostetler explains on a tour of the mill, is twofold: support local ranchers by helping them keep their operations sustainable and give a “brand identity” to Wyoming wool. 
“We coulda been just a cottage-in-our-garage kinda thing, but we wanted to impact the state and try to preserve ranching, because so much of it was disappearing, and you can only keep sustainable if you’re profitable,” she said on a rainy spring day as she recalled starting the company in 2007. 
“From the very beginning, we knew we needed wool, and we needed a rancher who was gonna see the vision,” she said.
Yarnold and Lambert greet visitors outside Mountain Meadow Wool in July 2025 in Buffalo. (Daniel Kenah/WyoFile)
One local rancher helped them launch the operation by donating 10,000 pounds of wool up front without payment. It took almost five years to use the entire supply, Hostetler explained, and they eventually paid for it all. 
Now, Mountain Meadow Wool exists as a tourist attraction, an internship opportunity, a way for ranchers to participate in a producer program and, of course, a mill for thousands and thousands of pounds of fibers. If you go to any locally owned yarn shop in Wyoming, chances are that you’ll find something that came from the mill.
Hostetler leads a tour around the mill, speaking loudly to be heard above the din of the machines, massive and ceaselessly moving. First, she explains how the machines’ long fingers move each strand of freshly spun yarn into sellable skeins — the oblong bundles of yarn you’d see in a craft store. Interns and employees float nimbly around the room, eyes darting from one operation to the next, as if they were circus tamers managing metal lions, tigers and bears. What the machines cannot do is wrap loops of yarn into hanks — loops that are twisted into themselves to preserve the quality of the wool and hang nicely on displays. That must be done by hand. 
Then, Hostetler reverses and goes into the room where the wool is processed and spun. Rain or not, that room is kept at 70 degrees and 70% humidity to prevent the fibers from getting staticky.

After all that comes the tourist room with an informational video and machines that guests can try, and the store, where you can buy anything from bleacher pads to one-off cones of various yarns. 
And faceless but omnipresent in the entire operation are the mostly Wyoming-based ranchers who provide their wool. 
Hostetler sets a baseline price for the yarn, so nothing changes with market ups and downs. That helps the producers and the brand: Mountain Meadow Wool gets to pay for the wool in a few payments; the producers don’t have to fret about higher or lower prices. 
The wool must pass a certain number of tests before the ranchers who provide it can be accepted into the brand’s producer program. The brand uses mostly Rambouillet, Targhee and Cormo wools, from sheep originally from France, the United States and Tasmania, respectively. 
“The rancher ends up making more money, because we don’t change our prices,” Hostetler said. “So we just go with that minimum, and we have probably 10 [ranchers] that we work with.”

Last year, those ranchers got lucky as the raging House Draw Fire swept north of them, according to Hostetler. But not everyone was so fortunate. 
In her office just off the store, Hostetler recalls seeing smoke billow into the sky. 
“Finding out what kind of devastation they had and watching the smoke columns, and knowing how fast it was running, you just wonder, ‘Where is it gonna go next?’ and ‘And when will it stop?’” 
Hostetler let her sentence trail off. “It was just concerning,” she said. “You feel a bit like it’s — like those big old fires from a long time ago that would race across the prairie.”
Luck was on her side, too. The fire was never going to cross her path. But she was still moved by its impact on the people who did meet it face-to-face. So she added a pop-up to Mountain Meadow Wool’s website giving visitors the chance to donate fencing to ranchers who were impacted by that fire. In the end, Hostetler said they raised between $18,000 and $19,000 from that. 
“It was really good how everybody pitched in,” she said.

With the tour complete, Hostetler sits in her office, gazing at the land outside her window. If you exit the office and turn left, you’ll find a wall full of products that the wool mill sells. The yarns are all named for places in Wyoming — Jackson, Alpine, Powell, Cody, La Barge. Hostetler only has a bit of time to talk before she hosts a monthly barbecue for her staff. 
And anyways, she has a sweater she wants to finish knitting.

Hostetler’s wool producers may have been able to escape a wildfire unscathed, but they have not been able to avoid the struggles of an industry in decline. 
Once upon a time, sheep flourished in Wyoming, where they could graze without parameters and were needed — and prized — for their wool and meat. Wyoming winters never pass without leaving their mark, of course, and there were other struggles that flockmasters faced, but for the most part, it was a golden era. 
It is not so anymore. Lands that once accommodated over 6 million sheep in the early 1900s are now down to around 320,000, according to a January 2024 report from the United States Department of Agriculture.

As president of the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, Alison Crane is troubled by the state of sheep ranching in Wyoming. Jim Magagna, who was a sheepman for most of his life and is now the president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, also understands it. 
They differ on what the causes are — after all, there are many, Crane said.
“It’s a lot of different reasons,” Crane said with a sigh. “And I’m sure if you talked to 20 different people, you’d get 20 different reasons.”
In Magagna’s eyes, it’s limitations on grazing; losing effective predator control methods; increased competition from wool imported from New Zealand and Australia; decline in the labor needed to shepherd thousands of sheep; negative connotations associated with sheep after World War II and dependence on a global market as opposed to a national one. 
“Thank goodness we do have some small mills like Mountain [Meadow Wool], because, again, historically there were large wool mills in the United States that used volumes of wool, particularly the finer-type wools that are produced off of the sheep here in the West,” he said. “Over time, they all went out of business, and the wool business moved to other countries.” 
We used to have a clear domestic wool market; now they’re dependent on a global market.”

In Crane’s eyes, the challenges are changes in the National Wool Act of 1954, which aimed to support domestic wool producers; changes in environmental policy and grazing management, particularly after 1972; the reintroduction of Bighorn sheep in some areas; increased imports of lamb and dropping wool prices. 
“People get frustrated and — it’s depressing to talk about, really,” she said.
“Places like Mountain Meadow Wool … they can do it on a small- to mid-range [level], but they’re helping, especially Wyoming producers, incentivize their wool,” she added. “Every little bit helps, but we need things like that to happen on a big scale. And we need it not only on the wool side, but also on the lamb side, too.”
Both Magagna and Crane decided as young adults that nothing — neither high-profile career paths nor the popularity of cattle — could dissuade them from pursuing sheep. Crane and her husband run about 400 to 500 sheep; Magagna’s flock peaked at around 8,000, though he now manages a much smaller number. 
While they’re aware of the industry’s struggles, to say it’s all doom and gloom would be inaccurate. Crane wants to double the amount of sheep that are in Wyoming, and the association she runs is seeing lots of new people — young people, she said — starting to join the sheep industry. Magagna, though not optimistic enough to believe that Wyoming’s sheep industry will ever ascend to what it once was, doesn’t see sheep ranching going extinct, either.

As for Hostetler and her wool mill, she has no plans to slow down how much she buys from her ranchers. Last year, the mill processed about 60,000 pounds of wool, she said. Balance can be tricky — those 60,000 pounds ensured that they won’t need to buy any more wool this year, which displeases Hostetler, as she doesn’t want to leave her ranchers hanging. 
But the mill has a brand new dyeing process that can be used not only for its own wool but for several other commercial brands. Their internship program, capped at four spots, received 150 applications for this summer. And they are setting up equipment to house another yarn-spinning operation. 
It might not happen this year, but Mountain Meadow has a new goal: double the amount they process – and tug the woolen strands of history, woven into the fabric of Wyoming, into the future with them.

It'd be the steepest in a series of sharp hikes.","Hundreds of union workers rallied outside the Statehouse in Trenton on Sept. 13, 2022, to protest health care premium increases. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Premiums under New Jersey’s public health benefit programs must mount an even steeper climb than seen in recent years if the beleaguered plans are to stay solvent through 2026, actuaries for the state told rate-setting commissions Wednesday.
Active state workers’ health care premiums should rise 19.7%, while local government workers who remain on the public plan should pay about 36.9% more for their health care, the actuaries said at a State Health Benefits Commission meeting Wednesday.
When informed of the proposed hikes, John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, said, “Holy s***.”
“The increase is simply unsustainable for employers, employees, and property taxpayers. The current system, where local governments have no control over the design of health benefit plans, does not work,” Donnadio said.
Local governments have no seats on the two commissions that set public health plan premiums. Their membership is split between labor representatives and administration representatives, who have a majority on both bodies.
Mike Cerra, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, called the proposed increases “unsustainable” and warned they would further burden local governments and their taxpayers.
Even the plan for school employees should see premiums rise by 31.9%, the actuaries said. That plan has escaped the steepest premium increases levied on the State Health Benefits Program and was granted some relief by 2020 changes that moved most of its enrollees to more cost-effective plans.
Retirees could also see steep increases. State Medicare retirees should pay 29.7% more in premiums, the state’s actuaries said, and early local government retirees should pay 35.4% more. 
The proposed increases, which must still be approved by the State and School Employees Health Benefit Commissions, are the latest in a series of double-digit premium hikes seen in recent years, and they could prove a death knell for plans covering local government and school workers.
 Cost spike
The Treasury in a May report warned that local government workers’ health plan had entered a death spiral as rising costs drove towns and cities with larger, healthier workforces to cheaper options in the private market, leaving the state with a sicker, smaller, and more expensive risk pool.
Unions have said hospital pricing and the public plans’ third-party administrators, Horizon and Aetna, are to blame for rising plan costs, which are outpacing increases in the private market and other state plans that have also been battered by the same trends.
“The unholy alliance between the carriers and the hospital networks has caused this spike in costs, no matter what Treasury says,” said Peter Andreyev, president of the State Policemen’s Benevolent Association. 
The proposed premium increases are likely to drive more municipalities to private options, and those departures will likely push premiums higher still.
“The expectation is that employers who leave the plan are lower cost on average, which leads to a higher-cost pool, which is going to increase costs further beyond expected trend increases,” said John Tappe, a vice president at Aon, the state’s actuary.
The plans’ cost drivers remain largely unchanged from previous years. Service and drug prices are increasing, utilization is up everywhere except in-patient services, and more and more public workers are using expensive weight loss drugs like Wegovy.
On top of those drivers, school and local government worker plans are struggling to maintain their reserves.
Those plans aim to have enough in reserves to cover two months of claims, but the school plan is projected to have enough in reserves for only half a month.
Last year, premiums were designed to bring in 3% more than costs to rebuild plan reserves, but they missed that target. State actuaries on Wednesday recommended doubling that target to 6%. The plans would need to increase premiums or reduce costs to reach that level of margin, and the increase is a significant driver of the proposed premium hikes for 2026.
All three plans operated at a loss in 2024 and 2025. Cost overruns for the school plan reached $254 million this year, while the state workers’ plan lost $232 million. The local part saw a deficit of $57 million.
Loans from the state to the local part of the State Health Benefits Program, which are needed to keep the latter plan solvent, are also driving up premiums. It remains unclear whether the local side will be able to repay those loans.
Treasury’s May report said the state may need to wind down the local part of the State Health Benefits Program altogether, a possibility decried by one of the State Health Benefit Commission’s labor members.
“While closing the local part of state health benefits may be bureaucratically attractive, it’s unconscionable. Over 300 municipal and county governments rely on state health benefits to provide them with health insurance,” said Dudley Burdge, the commission’s AFL-CIO representative for local government employees.
It’s not clear when the State and School Employees Health Benefit Commissions will approve rates for next year. The bodies have rate renewal meetings set for later this month, but Danielle Schimmel, the State Health Benefit Commission’s chair, said individual members’ appeals might require the panel to defer setting rates until a later meeting.
Language in the state’s budget calls for members of the plan design committees to identify $100 million in savings within the state part of the State Health Benefits Plan, annualized to $200 million over 2026, which is split between the state’s 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. It’s not clear that those savings, if materialized, would slow premium growth.

Small communities, without the reserves to smooth out the bumps that come with sudden revenue losses, will be hit first and hardest, argues columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Impacts of Wyoming’s property tax cuts are just beginning appeared first on WyoFile .","A recent news report highlighted trouble in Hot Springs County. The county commission was forced to make spending cuts, including withdrawing funds from the county 4-H program and laying off an employee at the county extension office due to a lack of revenue for the upcoming year. Hot Springs County residents were surprised by these cuts, correctly pointing to the great things these programs and personnel do. 

Opinion

They shouldn’t have been. This is precisely what was to be expected following the Legislature’s actions this past legislative session, as they cut one of local governments’ few sources of funding by implementing across-the-board residential property tax cuts. This is only the first small drop in the bucket of what is to come. We should all expect many more stories just like this in the coming years.
Hot Springs County is a fitting first place to see these impacts, as it illustrates an important coming trend. The places that are likely to see the most drastic impacts of the Legislature’s undercutting of state and local government funding are our small counties and communities. Places like Cheyenne, Casper and their counties have a broader tax base and more maneuverability in their budgets. Small communities don’t. Small communities are also less likely to have the reserves to smooth out the bumps that come with sudden revenue losses.
That is not to say that large communities will be immune. Cuts will hit them just as hard; they just may have a little more runway until the full impacts are felt. Cheyenne and Casper should also expect to see government services decline and personnel go away. And while the idea of “cutting government” sounds good, when we think about exactly what is being cut, the appeal often quickly fades. Local government in Wyoming does a lot of things that we often do not even think about, but may soon very acutely notice as they go away. When there is no longer plowing of city streets after a snowstorm, when ambulances or other first responders are cut and response times increase — or when communities do not provide rural services at all, or potholes go unfixed, we must all remember that this is what you get for that reduction in property taxes. We must also remember who are the people championing these reductions in government service.
The irony in this situation is that those directly responsible for making this situation worse are acting like they are here to save us from their own bad decisions. Several Freedom Caucus members recently arrived at an Appropriations Committee meeting wearing bright red jackets to highlight the projected $700 million shortfall in education funding by the 2029-2030 biennium. The implication here was not that we need to find increased funding for education. Rather, this was a salvo in what is likely to be a direct assault on Wyoming’s public education system. The irony arises because part of the reason the projected shortfall is so high is the very cuts imposed by this group of legislators. The impending education budget shortfall is a major concern, but these legislators cannot in good faith say that it was caused by someone else. This is a problem born from our state’s constitutional requirement to provide a free, equal and high-quality education to our students, the cost of providing that education, and the most recent Legislature’s decision to specifically undercut its ability to do so. 
The truly scary thing is that the recent property tax cuts may only be the first step. One recent proposal would have the state do away with all property taxes. A report by Wyoming AARP on the potential impacts of such a proposal pointed to a similar idea in Nebraska. The analysis in Nebraska showed that, to replace the revenue from doing away with property taxes there, sales taxes would have to be increased to a whopping 21%! That is not a tax cut; it just changes who is paying it, and it places more, not less, of the burden on those who are least equipped to handle it.
It is fair for all of us to think about how our state should be organized and funded. Those are legitimate questions, but that is not what has been happening over the past several years. Instead, we have fallen prey to talking points lifted from national debates where spending is a legitimate issue and the scope of government has far exceeded what most of us would prefer. Not so in Wyoming. Our local governments are already hard-pressed to perform their necessary functions. Our Legislature has made it even more difficult. Let’s hope the damage is not too great.

Legal and health policy experts say the court’s June ruling upholding a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors leaves the door open for other challenges — and restrictions. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”

– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor




The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
 Sex-based protections

The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
 ‘Scientific and policy debates’

Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(Photo: Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Suicide rates in rural America remain persistently higher than in urban communities, according to new research from East Tennessee State University that identified a national suicide “belt” with relatively high death rates that extends from the east to west coasts, directly through Tennessee.
Overall, rates of deaths by suicide increased in both rural and urban communities between 2018 and 2021, researchers noted. 
After the onset of the COVID pandemic, the nation experienced its biggest one-year increase in suicide deaths in 2021, claiming more than 48,000 lives. 
Rates in rural areas, however, were higher. While urban areas experienced suicide rates of about 13 to 14 per 100,000 residents between 2018 and 2021, rural areas recorded 19 to 20.
Researchers cited a variety of factors as contributing to higher rural suicide rates: among them, a lack of access to mental health care; stigma associated in seeking it; barriers that include transportation and poverty; and higher suicide rates associated with certain jobs, including agricultural work.
They also highlighted an acute shortage of mental health providers in rural communities. 
All but four of Tennessee’s 95 counties are designated mental health professionals shortage areas, according to data from the state’s Department of Health. Only Williamson, Rutherford, Wilson and Sumner counties are not.
Researchers noted an emerging national suicide belt that stretches across the mid-section of the country and includes parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. 
“The increasing suicide trends in the U.S. highlight the urgent need for enhanced mental health and preventative programs and services,” researchers concluded.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Tennesseans feeling a little extra heated about the weather this year are onto something: summers in the state are up to 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average than they were in 1970, according to a temperature data analysis by nonprofit Climate Central.
Researchers at Climate Central calculated average temperatures for summer — June, July, and August — from 1970 through 2024 using data collected and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The organization found that every Tennessee county’s average summer temperature was hotter in 2024 than in 1970. Obion County showed the least change at 0.7 degrees warmer. Macon and Montgomery counties were about 2.7 degrees warmer in 2024 than in 1970.


The rise in extreme summer heat is a nationwide issue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hotter weather is linked to increases in heat-related illnesses. The CDC’s Heat and Health Index shows communities in West and Northeast Tennessee are among the most likely in the nation to experience negative impacts of heat on their health. 
This summer has started off more sweltering than usual with average highs in June surpassing normal average high temperatures in some parts of Tennessee, according to the National Weather Service.
NWS Nashville reported both high and low temperatures above normal in Nashville, Clarksville and Crossville in June. Clarksville’s average low temperature was 69 degrees, four degrees hotter than normal. Nashville’s average high temperature of 89.4 degrees was 1.7 degrees over normal.
Nashville saw 14 days above 90 degrees in June, according to NWS Nashville.
Memphis’ monthly high for June came in at 95 degrees, 6 degrees warmer than the normal high temperature, according to NWS Memphis. But the area’s monthly low temperature of 61 degrees fell below the normal 69-degree low.
In East Tennessee, this June was Knoxville’s warmest since 2016, according to NWS Morristown, totaling 10 days with temperatures of 90 degrees or higher (three more than usual).
Who is most vulnerable to higher heat?
The CDC Heat and Health Index analyzes historical temperature, heat-related illness and data on factors that heighten exposure to heat or hinder people’s ability to cope, including the prevalence of pre-existing health conditions, demographics and environmental characteristics.
In Ripley, for example, residents of the 38063 ZIP code are likely more vulnerable to the impacts of heat than about 93% of the nation.
In Northwest Tennessee, Rogersville residents are likely more vulnerable to heat than 94.1% of the nation. Sociodemographic factors including poverty, disability status, being older than 65 and lacking health insurance contribute to the area’s higher risk. The town also ranks higher than 85.5% of the nation for residents living in mobile homes, another factor that can leave residents more vulnerable to heat exposure.
Tennessee’s most vulnerable community resides in the 37813 ZIP code in Morristown, which ranks in the top 98.2% of areas in the nation vulnerable to heat, according to the index.

Mark Green announced his intent to resign from Congress on July 20 and there will be a special election to replace him in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, a district which spans from deep blue Davidson County in the east to deep red Decatur County in the west. Under Tennessee law, an election to fill a congressional vacancy must take place by early November — a tight turnaround.
Democrats in Davidson County, in District 7, in Tennessee, and across the rest of the country have a unique opportunity to flip this seat. The Republican margin in Congress is already razor thin: Republicans can lose just three votes on any given legislation. A few strategic seat flips could place Democrats within striking distance of retaking the majority in the House. 
Now, if you’re a good self-defeating Democrat, you may be thinking to yourself, “Self, didn’t former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry lose this race just eight months ago by 21.5 points?” Well, yes. She did. Flipping the district will take some work, but there are a few factors that narrow the gap.

The two Democrats competing in special congressional elections since November have vastly outperformed the expectations for their districts. In April, Democratic candidate Gay Valimont in Florida’s 1st Congressional District moved her district 17 points from November in the special election to replace Rep. Matt Gaetz. Similarly, Joshua Weil improved the margin in Florida’s 6th Congressional District by 19 points, also in April. That sounds like an average of 18 points to me, and I do basic math every single day for a living. The gap in Tennessee’s District 7 of 21.5 points is not insurmountable.

 This special election has national implications. There are three other vacancies in Congress — Texas’s 18th Congressional District, Arizona’s 7th Congressional District, and Virginia’s 11th Congressional District are vacant due to deaths — right now which will require special elections: All three are in safe Democratic districts which are not likely to swing toward Republicans this cycle. In that case, all eyes will be on Tennessee as the premiere special election in the country. For once, a Tennessee Democratic candidate will have significant resources from outside the state. Assuming the other seats are retained by Democrats, once Green’s seat flips, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, will have a majority of just three members (he could lose just one vote on any given bill). Get your popcorn ready for a knockdown, drag-out fight for this seat.
President Donald Trump’s administration and congressional Republicans just handed the American public a hot mess with their One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBA”). The bill is certainly big, in terms of the tax cuts that the wealthy will reap and in terms of the harm that will be done to the poorest Americans, but it is anything but beautiful. The bill will cost millions of Americans their health coverage, shutter rural hospitals and the federal deficit will explode. (I’m beginning to think maybe it was never about fiscal responsibility?) This is not to mention the clean energy cuts and expansion of unaccountable Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation measures. Republicans may not realize just yet, but the bill harms Americans. Democrats are fired up and ready to go shout this from the rooftops.

The Tennessee race is winnable for Democrats, with the right candidate. So, what does that candidate look like? I’d say they’re looking for someone who is:

Pragmatic and can rise above petty politics to do the right thing at all costs;
Deeply caring about their community, their district, our country, and humanity at large;
Capable of crafting and delivering a message built on kitchen table, economic issues like better public schools, cheaper health coverage, lower prices and eliminating Trump tariffs;
Unafraid to stand up against the Trump political movement and stand up for those among us who are marginalized and forgotten;
Experienced in public service and knows the ins and outs of getting things done;
Exciting to the base, who can deliver a win with an effective campaign that is built on the fundamentals.

Democrats have a number of options to choose from that might fit the bill. Within days of Green announcing his resignation, two Democratic state representatives announced their candidacy for the seat: Rep. Bo Mitchell and Rep. Aftyn Behn, both of Nashville. A few other names are being tossed around as well, including Nashville Rep. Vincent Dixie and former Nashville Mayor John Cooper. Better buckle up, as Democrats are in for an exciting primary.
At the end of the day, no matter who you support this special election season, it’s important to engage in the process. Politics is about people after all. Democracy, if we work for it, gives people, like you, a voice.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature legislation to extend and expand tax cuts in exchange for cuts to Medicaid, Affordable Care Act health coverage and SNAP benefits will have a profound impact on Tennessee, according to estimates by multiple policy groups.
Trump signed the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” into law on July 4. The tax cuts will take effect almost immediately, while the full impact of cuts to social safety net programs will be phased in over the next several years.
Funding cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would primarily come from new work requirements for adults. This bureaucratic maneuver would impose additional paperwork requirements that advocates expect will disqualify recipients who are unable to complete them.


KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, estimates that changes to funding of the Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance as part of Trump’s legislation will result in around 2% of Tennesseans, or 68,000 people, losing access to their federally subsidized insurance. This matches a similar estimate made by the U.S. House Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee, which predicts even more dire consequences of 170,000 losing coverage.
But for Medicaid, Tennessee will see fewer cuts to its version of the program, called TennCare. Tennessee is one of 10 states that didn’t expand the program to provide insurance to more people living on near-poverty-line wages. 
Nearly 300,000 more Tennesseeans would have had access to Medicaid if the lawmakers had expanded the coverage allowed under the Affordable Care Act, according to the Tennessee Justice Center. The results of having fewer people covered mean fewer will lose coverage. 
Tennesseans will lose approximately 20% of their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. In 2022, nearly 700,000 Tennesseans received around $1.4 billion in SNAP funds, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. About half of those in Tennessee who qualify for the federal assistance are children.


Tennesseans could receive around $7 billion in income tax cuts as part of Trump’s legislation, according to an analysis compiled by The Lookout using U.S. Census household income data and estimates from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
In dollar terms, most of the tax cuts will benefit the wealthiest households in Tennessee.


Who voted for the bill
All eight of Tennessee’s Republican House members voted in favor of the legislation, as did both of the state’s GOP U.S. Senators.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act prevents the largest tax hike in American history and secures the largest tax cut ever for individuals and families who endured four years of crushing inflation and reckless spending,” said Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a statement.
The only member of the Tennessee delegation to oppose the legislation was Memphis Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen.
“The GOP’s One Big Ugly Bill fails every basic moral test,” said Cohen in a statement. “They are taking food and health care away from poor people so that the wealthiest individuals who have ever lived can become even wealthier.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


One person had a head injury, so the team helped him clean the wound and bandage it up.
Another person recently had surgery on his arm, so the team checked on his stitches and gave him information on medical respite housing.
The last person the team talked to needed a fresh bandage on a wound before a doctor’s appointment the next day. 
Most people the team interacted with just wanted some snacks and water, but STRIDE members offered sunscreen, menstrual hygiene products and first aid supplies to those they engaged with, too. 
STRIDE is a federally qualified health center, or an FQHC, meaning it serves an underserved population and qualifies for enhanced reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare. Its street medicine team treats people experiencing homelessness, which helps save everyone money, but now that work is threatened by recently passed Trump administration policies that could cut federal funding for health care.

The street medicine team at STRIDE, one of several teams doing this work in the state, travels around the five counties of the Denver metro area looking for people in need of medical attention on the streets. The idea emerged as center staff realized there was a population they still were not reaching, and started with just one person walking around with a backpack, according to Shawn Marzan, street medicine and community outreach program manager.
“If there was ever a catchphrase that works in street medicine, it is going to the people, and there really isn’t anywhere that we won’t go to find people,” Marzan said. “We have gone to encampments, we’ve gone to overpasses, under bridges, in parks, in fields. There isn’t a place that we won’t provide care for people.”
If the street medicine team was not out looking for people in need of medical care, many people experiencing homelessness would seek medical attention only in emergencies. That leads to expensive and preventable emergency room visits, according to Joanne Accardi, medical director of convenient care and street medicine at STRIDE. 
“Going to the ER puts a big strain on the health care system in general, Medicaid or not,” Accardi said. “When they go there, a lot of times it’s stuff that we can manage here in the clinic, and it inundates the ER and then there’s delays in care for people that are more acutely sick.” 










If there was ever a catchphrase that works in street medicine, it is going to the people, and there really isn’t anywhere that we won’t go to find people.


– Shawn Marzan, of STRIDE


Marzan said one of the patients he sees regularly averaged more than 30 emergency room visits in a year for the same condition. After the first time he engaged with the street medicine team, Marzan said that patient went seven months without going to the emergency room. 
Allison Draayer, business development manager at STRIDE, said emergency rooms in the metro area are familiar with the street medicine program and will let patients know to look to them for follow-up care if they are being discharged to the streets. She said their work has led to a decrease in emergency room visits. 
Many people experiencing homelessness can afford medical care only if they are enrolled in Medicaid. One patient the team has interacted with had diabetes, but because he didn’t have insurance coverage, he wasn’t able to afford insulin from the pharmacy. He hadn’t taken any insulin in about a month.

The street medicine team will help someone enroll in Medicaid on the spot, and Medicaid then reimburses STRIDE for the care they provide those patients. The nurses and medical assistants who walk around will assess a patient’s needs and provide care as needed. The team also has a device that allows members to connect with a doctor for a telehealth appointment, and the doctor can see and hear everything those on the ground do. 
STRIDE also partners with organizations that have expertise in housing and substance abuse recovery to ensure those the street medicine team interacts with can connect with the proper resources. Representatives with RTD will join them and hand out bus passes.
Cody Kiebler helps connect people who want to recover from substance abuse with the proper resources. Working in conjunction with the street medicine team benefits everyone involved, he said, because while he isn’t equipped to provide medical care, he is better suited to navigate conversations about substance abuse for people who want to get sober. 
“This provides us more access in this world and really completes that picture, because if I go out as just me doing street outreach, I don’t have the energy, the effort, the ability to reach everyone we do, and I don’t have the resources,” Kiebler said. “This spreads the resources between different groups, different teams, how we work, different companies, as well as the care people can get. It really feels good to be part of a cool team.”
Medicaid cuts put program in jeopardy
A statement from Kim Bimestefer, executive director of Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, said changes to Medicaid following the recent passage of Republicans’ policy megabill will lead to “large-scale loss of health insurance coverage for Coloradans and an extraordinary cost shift to our state that Colorado’s state budget cannot absorb.” With imminent cuts and changes to Medicaid eligibility, the future of programs like STRIDE’s Street Medicine Team are threatened. 
Without the reimbursements STRIDE gets from Medicaid and Medicare as an FQHC, running a street medicine program would be incredibly costly. 
“Part of the reason why you don’t see a ton of (FQHCs) doing this is because it’s extremely expensive,” Draayer said. “We try to run it on a very lean team … It’s very, very expensive for FQHCs to do these models, and it requires partnership. It requires people to be invested in it in order to see it succeed.”
Accardi said reduced Medicaid coverage will affect everyone who needs health care, not just those covered by the program. She said emergency rooms and shelters will be more crowded as people are unable to access consistent care, and STRIDE’s street medicine team would have to reduce its capacity. 
“Without the funding, then we can’t send as big a team out on the street, and then the patients will inevitably go back to the ER or get no treatment at all,” Accardi said. “We could still see them, but then how am I going to get them their meds? We would see less patients, and they would be sicker.”
Marzan said cuts to Medicaid will lead to increased wait times to get appointments and to get seen in the emergency room. Draayer said more people going to the emergency room who cannot afford it will lead to everyone’s medical bills and insurance costs going up. She said community health centers like STRIDE will see increased demand, too.  
“One of the best ways to invest in efficiency and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse is by investing in community health centers, because we do a lot with a little, and that’s what I would also encourage people to understand,” Draayer said. “We often go by the wayside, and people don’t see us, but we do this work and we do it really well.” 
The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless also has a street medicine team, and spokesperson Cathy Alderman said the organization relies on Colorado’s “presumptive eligibility” provision of Medicaid enrollment to get reimbursed for the care it provides. That means if certain factors can lead to a fair assumption someone would qualify for Medicaid, those providing care could be retroactively reimbursed once that person is enrolled.
“In a world where people both have to income-qualify for Medicaid and also demonstrate that they are complying with work requirements, that would be impossible for us to determine on the streets,” Alderman said.

Marzan said the patients he works with on the streets are “some of the most caring and humble people you can meet.” During summer months, he said many of them will offer their drinks to him and his team, and in the winter months, they’ll offer up one of their layers for added warmth. He said he wishes more people could see “that interaction, that moment between two humans.”
Accardi said Marzan and his team “have done a very good job of getting a reputation in the community with our homeless population.” 
“It took a while to gain the trust, but now the word is out there,” Accardi said. “It’s literally out there on the street, and I think that that’s why we do see so many people, because we’re trusted.”

Derrick Van Orden (R-Prairie du Chien) speaks at a hearing in the House of Representatives. Van Orden claims to have engineered the Wisconsin State budget deal that mitigated the Medicaid cuts he voted for. | Screenshot via YoutubeSuccess has many fathers, but U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden is not one of them. Contrary to Van Orden’s triumphant tweets, he did not “secure” $1 billion for rural health care in Wisconsin. He had nothing to do with the bipartisan state budget deal that was drafted and rushed to completion in order to capture those funds — which, by the way, represent just a fraction of the billions the state stands to lose in Medicaid funds under the Republican mega bill Van Orden approved.
What Van Orden did do was vote to cut Medicaid and Affordable Care Act health insurance, with the result that tens of thousands of rural Wisconsinites now face losing their health care coverage and several rural Wisconsin hospitals are in danger of closing. As he prepared to join the narrow, four-vote majority that passed the disastrous federal bill, Van Orden sent some last-minute messages to Gov. Tony Evers urging him to hurry up and sign the deal Evers had already reached with state legislators. Now Van Orden is taking credit for Wisconsin leaders’ work mitigating the harm he caused. It would be laughable if the consequences were not so dire. 
For months, Evers and leaders of the Wisconsin Legislature met behind closed doors to hammer out a deal, even as massive federal cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs essential to the wellbeing of Wisconsinites loomed. Among the issues Evers and legislative leaders agreed on was the importance of getting the budget done before the federal mega bill was signed, so the state could still qualify for $1 billion in soon-to-expire Medicaid matching funds. 
Evers signed the budget in the nick of time last week, at 1:30 a.m. on July 3, just before the U.S. Congress granted President Donald Trump’s wish and sent him his “big beautiful bill” to sign on July 4. 
Van Orden immediately began taking credit for both budgets.
“I just helped secure $1,000,000,000 a year for BadgerCare and $500,000,000 for rural healthcare infrastructure,” Van Orden boasted on X. The $500 million he claimed credit for was added to the bill by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and other Senate Republicans worried about the bill’s devastating impact on rural hospitals. Van Orden had nothing to do with it. Nor is the money earmarked for Wisconsin — it’s a nationwide program meant to blunt the blow Van Orden and his GOP colleagues have just dealt to rural health care. 
But the biggest whopper Van Orden told is that he somehow led the bipartisan budget deal between Evers and the Legislature. 










You know, he poured gasoline around the house. He started throwing matches around, and then he said, ‘you better use that extinguisher.'


– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan


It seemed weird at the time when Van Orden, on the brink of voting for the federal law that will cause so many Wisconsinites to lose their health care, started shouting at Evers on X to hurry up and sign the state budget.
Now it’s clear that he was simultaneously preparing to vote to take health care away from his constituents and planning to take credit for saving them from the effects of his own vote.
After both budgets were signed, Van Orden repeatedly shared a copy of a letter he wrote to Evers on July 2 emphasizing the “importance of signing the proposed state budget into law without delay.” According to Van Orden, the letter and a conversation he claims to have had with Evers caused the governor to sign the deal the next day. 
“Not true,” Evers spokesperson Britt Cudaback wrote on X in response to Van Orden’s bragging. “You never personally advocated to @GovEvers or our office to increase the hospital assessment in the bipartisan budget deal until it was already in the deal. And you had zero to do with Gov. Evers deciding to sign the budget before the reconciliation bill was signed.” 
What Van Orden did do was to vote for a bill that will push an estimated 30,000 rural Wisconsinites off Medicaid and will take away food assistance from another 90,000 people in the state, 1 in 3 of whom are children.
Van Orden was one of several Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who expressed concern about the food assistance cuts in the GOP mega-bill — and then voted for the cuts anyway. 
Those cuts only got deeper after the bill moved to the U.S. Senate, and the bill’s cost in massive increases to the federal deficit also grew from $2.5 trillion in the House version to $3.4 trillion in the final deal. Still, Van Orden stayed on board, voting for the bill a second time when it came back to the House and sending it to President Donald Trump to sign into law.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan compares Van Orden to an arsonist who takes credit for recommending the residents of the house he torched take steps to put out the fire. “You know, he poured gasoline around the house. He started throwing matches around, and then he said, ‘you better use that extinguisher,’” Pocan said at a press briefing this week.
Van Orden continues to obfuscate. In between doubling down on his preposterous claims and slinging insults at his detractors on social media, the congressman who has been rebuked by Senate leaders of both parties for yelling vulgarities at high school pages claimed to have given Evers a lesson in civility and bipartisanship:  “Why did Tony sign the bill at 1:30 am? Because I asked him personally to put politics aside,” he declared this week. 
For all his posturing on X, Van Orden still hasn’t been willing to face his constituents in a town hall to stand behind his vote. Pocan decided to hold one for him last month, to explain the details of what he called the worst budget bill he’s seen in 30 years in politics. At a press conference Pocan said, “I think this month I may have to do another visit.”

(Getty Images) While standing on the deck of a friend’s yacht last week in Bermuda, Gov. Jeff Landry praised a new Louisiana tax break on boat purchases in a short video he shared to social media. 

“Louisiana’s been known as a sportsman’s paradise, but it’s not always treated our sportsmen friendly,” Landry said in the recording posted July 3. 
“This year, we made Louisiana sportsman-friendly by capping the amount of taxes you pay when you buy you a new boat or register your boat in Louisiana,” the governor said as the wake of the multimillion-dollar vessel churned behind him. 
What the governor didn’t mention is the tax break, which took effect July 1, only applies to boats worth $200,000 or more.
The yacht owner hosting Landry, Shane Guidry, is the governor’s close friend, political adviser and top campaign donor. Guidry told the Illuminator he personally suggested the tax break for luxury boats to the governor. 
“I recommended to him a year ago that he should look at them,” he said in a phone interview from the 82-foot Viking yacht he took to Bermuda this month. 
Guidry said he owns nine fishing and pleasure boats, including three yachts he estimated are worth a combined $50 million. 

He is the head of Harvey Gulf International Marine, a billion-dollar marine transportation company that services the offshore energy sector. The business is based in New Orleans, but Guidry also spends several weeks a year on his passion project: Team Harvey Fishing, which competes in international tournaments for prize money. 
A Metairie resident, Guidry registered his yachts in Palm Beach, Florida, where boat taxes were, until this month, far lower. Louisiana’s new tax break should entice high-end boat owners to register their watercraft locally, he said, resulting in more tax revenue for Louisiana. 
“Something is better than getting zero,” he said. 

The governor joined Guidry over the July 4 holiday while Team Harvey Fishing participated in the Bermuda Billfish Blast, the first of three consecutive tournaments in the British territory. This year, the event awarded $1.4 million in prize money.

The governor’s office declined to answer a question about whether the idea for the tax break came from Guidry.

Great news heading into the 4th of July weekend!

State officials say tax break will generate more money
In June, the Louisiana Legislature approved a cap of $20,000 on local and state sales taxes applied to boats as long as the taxes are paid within 90 days of a boat’s purchase. The provision was part of a larger omnibus bill sponsored by Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, that included several other, unrelated tax changes. 
The cap will only benefit more expensive boats because the average combined local and state sales tax in Louisiana is 10% – or the equivalent of $20,000 on a $200,000 purchase. This limit will increase in the future; the law requires the $20,000 threshold to be adjusted for inflation every five years starting in 2030. 

The break applies to purchases of personal boats and those tourist and fishing charter companies use. Commercial shrimpers and fishers won’t see any benefits because their boats are already exempt from sales tax. 
State Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson said the change is meant to encourage Louisiana residents with pricier boats to bring them back home, as Guidry suggested. Many luxury boat owners register in other states to avoid Louisiana’s high taxes, Nelson said. 
Florida and Texas, for example, have caps on taxes for most boats of $18,000 and $18,750 respectively, though Texas also applies a separate tax on certain types of boat motors. 

“It’s a negligible cost if it costs us anything,” said Nelson, a Landry appointee, of the luxury boat tax break. “[The state] might end up making money.” 
Emerson said the adjustment is also part of a wider policy discussion regarding the burden of sales taxes on big-ticket items such as recreational vehicles, high-end cars and boats. 

Wealthy people have the ability to dodge Louisiana’s high tax rate on these items if they keep them in other states. Offering more local tax breaks might mean the government can collect at least some revenue on the purchases, she said. 

“In my opinion, it is not going to make the state lose money. It’s going to make the state gain money,” Emerson said of the boat tax break. 
Charter fishing tour operator Adam Peterson said he believes the tax break will be a boon for his industry. Many people who offer charter experiences lease their vessels from independent owners, but the tax break should result in fewer expenses for the charter companies, he said. 
“Whenever we have to re-register [boats], we are going to register it in Louisiana,” said Peterson who owns Gulf of America Outfitters, which runs fishing charters out of Venice, Port Fourchon and Lake Charles. 
The tax change comes at a time when most Louisiana residents are paying more in sales taxes however. 
Seven months ago, Landry and lawmakers hiked the state sales tax rate across the board from 4.45% to 5% and expanded it to routine purchases, including streaming entertainment services and cable television subscriptions. 

The tax increase is meant to partially make up for income and corporate tax cuts enacted at the same time, but it also left Louisiana with the highest average sales tax rate in the country. 
“I don’t necessarily blame the boat owners for seeking an exemption, but the better long-term solution is to have a lower sales tax with a broader base,” said Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, which studies state fiscal policies. 
 


Lawmakers approved tax break quietly
Lawmakers passed the boat tax cap without public debate on the policy change. 
The provision was quietly added to the larger sales tax bill June 12 in the final hours of the two-month legislative session. It was inserted through a conference committee, the secretive process in which six lawmakers negotiate and make changes to legislation in private before asking the full legislature to take a vote on a proposal.

Sen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge, said he wasn’t aware of the boat tax change, even though he was a member of the conference committee and pushed for the bill’s final approval in the Senate. He assumes it was one of several amendments requested by revenue department officials who work for the Landry administration. 

“I don’t remember discussing the tax cap on boats during our conference meetings,” Foil said. 
The final version of the bill passed overwhelmingly, with a 32-3 vote in the Senate and an 85-11 vote in the House. 
“I think it’s a perfect example of our upside-down tax policy,” said Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, a legislator who voted against the bill and is a member of the House committee that oversees tax policy.   
“We are giving tax breaks to people who own very expensive boats but we can’t give tax breaks to people who own cheap cars or who have expensive insurance policy premiums,” she said. 

Guidry’s boats likely to stay in Florida – for now
Assuming Guidry’s three yachts cost $50 million, he would have had to pay approximately $5 million in taxes to register them in Louisiana under the old law. Now, he would pay just $60,000. 
But Guidry said he doesn’t plan to move any of the three boats from Florida soon. The transoms of the vessels have already been painted with his fishing team’s name and their home port – Palm Beach. It’s an expensive process he doesn’t want to redo, he said. 
But the offshore mogul said he might replace his largest yacht, a 130-foot Westport where Landry stayed during the Super Bowl in New Orleans earlier this year. If he upgrades to a 150-foot boat, Guidry said he will consider registering it in Louisiana. 
Guidry appears to spare no expense when it comes to his yachts and isn’t shy about showing them off on social media. 
The Team Harvey Fishing Instagram account includes several glamour reels of the 82-foot Viking yacht, which was completed for his team in early June. 

One post from June highlights tissue boxes and blankets from luxury fashion brands Hermes and Louis Vuitton decorating the boat’s cabin. Another pans to an ottoman, custom-made for the yacht with Himalayan crocodile skin, according to the post caption. The material is famous because it is used in Hermes’ opulent Birkin bags, which sell for over $50,000.

(Ty McClung | West Virginia University)On a warm summer day in late May, about 100 people are waiting for their turn to go inside the Neighborhood S.H.O.P., located in the annex of Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia. 
Inside the S.H.O.P. — which stands for Showers Healthcare Outreach Program — they will find resources like naloxone, clothing, first-aid supplies, food, showers and people offering services from rental to legal assistance. Director Derek Hudson says the no-barrier organization aids almost 2,000 people a month.
“The whole goal is to have people come in, be heard and know that at least someone is trying to help them,” Hudson said. 
The kind of help the S.H.O.P. provides, broadly speaking, is harm reduction. 
“Harm reduction for us focuses on meeting people where they are and empowering them with the tools to help prevent negative health outcomes from substance use,” Hudson explained. “Harm reduction, simply put, saves lives.”

What they won’t find inside, however, is one of the most well-known forms of harm reduction: new syringes. 
Syringe Service Programs are highly regulated in the state of West Virginia, and service providers say it makes it almost impossible to run one. But SSPs are associated with an approximately 50% reduction in HIV and HCV incidence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also benefit communities and public safety by reducing needlestick injuries and overdose deaths.
Hudson’s S.H.O.P. has received about $80,000 in state opioid settlement funds from the West Virginia First Foundation specifically to create a re-entry program that will house people who are coming out of incarceration. It’s a program that will reduce recidivism and homelessness in the community, Hudson says, but it is not considered a harm reduction program. 
Programs that provide more typical harm reduction in the form of practical strategies that reduce the negative consequences of drug use — which can include anything from free naloxone to wound care — are not receiving any of the tens of millions of dollars coming into state, county and city level government coffers in West Virginia from the 2021 global opioid lawsuit settlement agreement so far, according to an analysis by students from West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media of Freedom of Information Act responses from 50 of the state’s 55 counties. And without those funds, many of the people working to provide these services worry that disease transmission and overdose death rates will buck a national trend and rise in West Virginia once again. 
The high cost of a crisis
The funds are the result of a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 720,000 people died from an opioid overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2022. West Virginia saw its peak in 2022, when 1,335, or 75 out of every 100,000 people, died of an overdose. 
West Virginia will receive about $980 million in total from the settlement agreement, split into payments over 18 years, with larger payments coming up front. The West Virginia First Foundation — a nonprofit created by the state Legislature — will control the spending of 72.5% of the funds, local governments 24.5%, and the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office 3%. A Memorandum of Understanding dictates what the money can be spent on, ranging from law enforcement, prevention education, treatment and recovery to harm reduction. 
In 2023, more than $73.5 million of those funds were distributed to county officials in the state’s 55 counties. An analysis of FOIA responses by journalism students at West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media lacks information for five counties, but of the 50 others, Logan County received the highest distribution at $3,983,631, and Jefferson County received the least at $62,773. 
Kanawha County, where the state’s capital Charleston is located, received just more than $3.9 million, and, according to County Commissioner Lance Wheeler, is focusing on funding recovery options. But Wheeler says they are also considering funding harm reduction organizations as well. 
“This is something I strongly support,” Wheeler said. “We’re going to continue to do that, helping those who have a track record of success and those who are helping people who are struggling.”
The collapse of a program — and the fallout that followed
Harm reduction has a long, complicated history in Kanawha County and Charleston. With a population of 47,000, Charleston is the largest city in the state. It also had the highest overdose rate per capita in the entire country in 2022.
The city health department started a syringe service program in 2015, but was open for just three years before public and political pressure forced the city to shut it down. Then-mayor Danny Jones, a Republican, called the program a “mini-mall for junkies and drug dealers.” 

The program’s closure in 2018, however, had dire consequences for public health. HIV and hepatitis rates skyrocketed, eventually requiring CDC officials to travel to Charleston in 2021 to help the city contain the outbreak.
Then-CDC HIV Prevention Chief Dr. Demetre Daskalakis called the outbreak “the most concerning HIV outbreak in the United States.” 
The fight for evidence-based and person-first
Iris Sidikman, the harm reduction coordinator at the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, said the reluctance to fund harm-reduction services has directly impacted organizations that go beyond providing syringe services.
“When you have a tool to give someone in a non-judgmental space, it can open a world of possibilities,” Sidikman said.  
In 2024, the Women’s Health Center applied to the Kanawha County Commission for $250,000 in opioid settlement funds twice, first through an online application and again at a public commission meeting. The clinic intended to use some the funds to provide increased naloxone training and education, cover costs related to screening and treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C and to fund a portion of clinical and programmatic staff salaries for the Harm Reduction Program, Sidikman said. Their application was denied without explanation. 
The Women’s Health Center also applied with Charleston City Council in August 2023 to create a syringe service program on Charleston’s West Side, but was denied due to fear of an “increase in drug use and crime.”
Research on harm reduction by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has shown that these practices reduce disease transmission and overdose rates, and experts believe politicians should look at the numbers more often. 
“What we want to do with data analysis… is to be able to produce the evidence to show to political power that these interventions are working and capable, they are saving many lives,” said RTI International Research and Public Health Analyst Barrett Montgomery. 
SOAR WV, another grassroots, Charleston-based harm reduction group, works to promote the health, dignity and voices of individuals who are impacted by substance use disorders, according to its website. SOAR and other organizations picked up the task of providing new syringes until the state Legislature passed Senate Bill 334 in 2021, which included strict regulations for running a syringe service program, such as requiring a West Virginia state ID in order to participate.

The city of Charleston also passed stipulations requiring that each syringe be uniquely labeled for tracking purposes. 
As of June 2025, West Virginia Health Right operates the only syringe-service program in Charleston, but according to one source, “doesn’t even begin to make a dent in the problem.”  
The political appetite is lacking because of a lack of information around the subject, says Dr. Susan Margaret Murphy, president of the Drug Intervention Institute in Charleston.
“Unfortunately, we are in a political climate where I don’t think research and scientific knowledge necessarily pleads the case. So sometimes it’s got to be kind of a heart-on-the-sleeve storytelling type of approach,” she said. 
Stigma and the struggle for support
In neighboring Boone County, Commissioner Brett Kuhn agreed. 
The county currently does not have any harm reduction services, and, so far, its three elected commissioners have not spent any of their $2.9 million in opioid settlement funds to provide them.
“I think in a rural setting, you’re going to see more pushback than you would in more of an urban setting,” Kuhn said. “I think with the syringes, it’s like people think we’re subsidizing the drug use, whereas with naloxone the attitude is more like, ‘well, we’re trying to help somebody that’s in trouble.’ And really, if you look at it, in both cases, is there any real difference between the two?”
Kuhn says that informing the public about how harm reduction works and its benefits to the community is key to fighting pushback. 
“You’ve got to get out ahead of the curve. You’ve got to get out there and get the information out,” Kuhn said. “I sometimes think we don’t do a good enough job of that.”
Kuhn said his county experienced the brunt of the nation’s opioid overdose epidemic firsthand. Its opioid mortality rate in 2023 was 82.0 per 100,000, the second-highest rate in West Virginia, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. 
Instead of harm reduction programs, the county spent its funds on paying off its regional jail bill, supporting a food pantry, a county arrest record-keeping system, a rapid response vehicle for EMTs, and a 25-bed expansion at Hero House, a faith-based sober living home in Madison.
Kuhn and officials in other counties say the vague nature of the state’s MOU overviewing how the money can be spent puts the duty of interpretation on local officials. The county did not hold special community meetings or town halls to gather input on how to spend the funds. 
But Kuhn says it’s rebuilding a sense of community that could help garner support for harm reduction services. 
“I think it’s sometimes the attitude is ‘well, those people don’t want to help themselves,’” Kuhn said, “[but] if they don’t want to help themselves, then what do I need to do to try to help? And I think in a certain sense, we’ve lost that sense of community, that we’re all in this together.”
Kuhn hopes that can change in the future.

(Contributed/Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley)Frozen federal grants are putting North Dakota after-school programs in limbo, pausing teacher training and leaving schools scrambling, education officials said this week.
The U.S. Office of Management and Budget withheld $6.8 billion in federal education grants for the upcoming school year for further review. The total withheld for North Dakota is estimated to be about $25.4 million, based on what the state received in 2024, according to the state Department of Public Instruction. That represents about 15% of what the state receives annually in K-12 funding from the U.S. Department of Education, according to the Learning Policy Institute. 
About $6.5 million that has been withheld for North Dakota was for 21st Century Community Learning, which supports programs held before and after school.
“We are all in limbo,” said Robin Nelson, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley. 
About 109 after-school programs that serve nearly 7,000 North Dakota students and employ more than 565 staff could be affected if the funding isn’t restored soon, said Nelson, also a member of the North Dakota Afterschool Network leadership team.
“Everybody is kind of on pins and needles just waiting for what happens next, and we’re kind of at the mercy of what is determined by our federal administration,” she said.
After-school providers use the grants in different ways, so the impact may vary depending on the provider, she said. The Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley used the grants to provide up to 85% tuition assistance for families that qualified, but those discounts may no longer be available unless the funds are released by the start of the school year.
States in ‘triage mode’ over $6B in withheld K-12 funding

“We would be charging the full amount and trying to leverage other sources to continue to make our programming affordable,” Nelson said. “Not only is it youth programming, but a lot of families use it as child care, so this crosses over into the child care crisis and shortage as well.”
The federal government could still release the grants after completing its review process, said Amanda Peterson, director of educational improvement and support for the Department of Public Instruction. But some North Dakota providers, especially in rural areas, may not be able to wait that long, she said.
“There are some entities that will still run summer programming, however they would have to raise their rates, or minimize their programming,” Peterson said. “You are going to have families that are going to be in need of after-school programming that may find that their local area doesn’t have the same capacity to support those programs.”
Peterson said she has not heard of any in-state providers closing their doors yet, but she is worried about the funding pause affecting student performance.
Pausing the grants so close to the beginning of the school year complicates how programs can respond, Peterson said.
“It’s one thing if we have a runway to plan for these funds, but when you are scrambling right before school starts … you are not focusing on the right thing,” she said. 
About $6.3 million of the frozen grant funding was designated to support North Dakota student support and academic enrichment. Those grants can cover a variety of costs to support a well-rounded education, improve school conditions and upgrade technology.
Other grants that were withheld fund migrant education, English language instruction and adult education.
An estimated $10 million withheld for North Dakota was designated for teacher professional development. Those dollars support skills training such as curriculum building and developing effective teaching strategies, Peterson said.
“There is just a plethora of professional development that teachers need as ongoing training that is going to be missed,” Peterson said. “A lot of times, because that is something that is extra and supplemental, it’s the first thing to go if these funds do not exist.”
North Dakota Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Kirsten Baesler told school administrators in a June 30 notice that districts can keep the programs affected in their 2025-26 budgets, but they would need to use other dollars to cover the costs until the federal funds are released. 
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Baesler added those districts would be using the funds at their own risk as the Department of Public Instruction would not be able to reimburse the districts if the funding is not restored.
Baesler has been nominated to work in the U.S. Department of Education as assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education. Her nomination was advanced by a committee and needs to be confirmed by the Senate.
In an interview Monday, U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Trump administration officials have not hidden the fact that they want to return a lot of education funding to the states.
“What I do think is there will be a shifting … to where education is supposed to be delivered at the state level,” Cramer said. 
He added he will continue to be in contact with Education Secretary Linda McMahon to try to ensure the rug is not pulled out from anyone.
Nick Archuleta, president of ND United, an educator and public employee union, said cuts to teacher preparedness will impact student success.
“I would encourage them, whatever review they are allegedly doing, that they do that review, do it quickly and get these funds out to where they can do the most good, and that is in our classrooms and in our after-school programming,” Archuleta said.




Frozen funds
The U.S. Department of Education has paused about $25.4 million in grants for North Dakota, based on what the Department of Public Instruction received in 2024. The funds include:

$10 million for teacher professional development
$6.5 million for after-school programming
$6.3 million for student support, academic enrichment
$1.2 million for adult education
$740,000 for education of migrant children
$636,000 for English language instruction

They are: Bob and Doug Dreessen, board chair and president, respectively, of TD2 (Thompson, Dreessen & Dorner) engineering and surveying; David Maenner, senior vice president of CBRE Omaha; Michael Matejka, real estate attorney at Woods Aitken Law; and Nancy Pridal, board chair at Lamp Rynearson engineering.
“Over the course of their careers, each of these honorees has been pivotal and instrumental in moving the development and growth of our region forward,” said Jerry Slusky, a real estate attorney who founded the conference in 1990.
At the time, Slusky recalled, he had been teaching a course at the Creighton University School of Law, and the commercial real estate industry was depressed. He suggested to the dean that a workshop would be more impactful. 
The event started with about 125 attendees and has evolved into an all-day conference, with a registration fee, at the CHI Health Center. Chris Mensinger, senior vice president at Colliers International, co-directs the event.

This year, up to 900 real estate, business professionals and other participants are expected. The 2025 theme is, “Next Chapter: Growth, Change, and Opportunity.”
A luncheon ceremony will feature the hall-of-famers and other award winners selected by a committee of industry representatives. Awards include: 

“Development of the year,” which recognizes a project that stands out in scope and influence on further development, goes to the 37 West Farnam mixed-use project. In Omaha’s historic Blackstone District, the 10-story building features retail space, 160 market-rate apartments and a 384-stall parking garage to ease parking problems in the entertainment district. Developers are Clarity, GreenSlate and Park Omaha.
The ‘Summit award,” which recognizes a project that has outstanding and rippling regional impact, goes to the Catalyst project led by GreenSlate Development and Koelbel & Co. The 170,000-square-foot co-working hub for healthcare and technology businesses is just west of the main campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
“Deal of the year,” which is awarded to brokers for a complex and community impactful transaction, goes to a team that worked on the relocation of engineering firm Olsson to the Row at Heartwood Preserve in west Omaha. The team: Martin Patzner and Jason Fisher of Cushman & Wakefield/The Lund Co.; and Steve Sheppard, Nick Weideman and Bennett Ginsberg of CBRE Omaha. 

Slusky said the summit’s agenda reflects and delves into the most recent trends in commercial real estate. It features panels on topics such as Making Municipal Incentives Work and Legislative Insights and Updates.

(Getty Images)If you were listening earlier this year as the governor and legislature pushed through legislation to incentivize data centers and microgrids in West Virginia, you would have heard a lot about China. Lawmakers said we are in an artificial intelligence race with China, and West Virginia is primed to be a spot to build a new data center-heavy economy. The bill, House Bill 2014, even includes specific references to China.
That echoes concerns I’ve seen nationally as well. Both Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Congress members, and countless other experts in national defense, the technology industry, and more have said that we’ve found ourselves in a new arms race in regards to AI. They say if we want to win that race, we’ll need vast amounts more energy than we have today. A recent Department of Energy study estimates AI energy needs could triple in just the next three years alone. 
Why then, did Congress just pass a bill that will set our new electricity generation back years, raise utility prices for consumers and continue our reliance on dirtier, costlier energy projects that take longer to build?
I’m talking about the One Big, Beautiful Bill, passed just before Independence Day last week. 
There are a lot of things in that bill that will set the country back, including saddling future generations with an additional $3 trillion in debt. Surprisingly, they will manage to add to the debt while also kicking low-income people off of health and food benefits. That’s because the bill will extend expiring tax breaks with the largest benefits going to the wealthy. 
Much can and has been written about the hunger and health consequences of the big, beautiful bill. If you want to read about how up to 17 million people in the country could lose health insurance because of newly imposed work and reporting requirements or how rural hospitals are at risk thanks to those and other changes, I encourage you to check out resources from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy (Disclaimer: I’m on the board of WVCBP, but I don’t speak for them). 
The bill also drastically cuts back on energy incentives that were created or enhanced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That bill had several goals, including revitalizing the United States’ energy manufacturing economy and making renewable energy more affordable for more people, nonprofits, cities and even utilities. One argument antirenewable (and affordable) energy advocates have is that the equipment is made in China, and we’d be too reliant on them if we built renewable energy here. There’s some truth in that, but that’s why the IRA set out to reshore American manufacturing jobs. Even West Virginia has been on its way to becoming a hub for renewable energy-oriented manufacturing, with Toyota building hybrid car parts, Form Energy building utility-scale batteries and solar installers constructing projects and creating jobs all around the state. 
If West Virginia policymakers want to attract data centers, they need to understand a few things. Companies like Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Amazon and Microsoft have renewable energy goals. Also, renewable energy is faster and cheaper to build than gas plants, and contrary to what nostalgic West Virginia lawmakers want their voters to think, no one is going to build a large coal plant anytime soon. The last new large coal plant was built in 2013. Solar energy plus battery storage is faster in part because there is a tremendous backlog in the materials needed to construct gas plants. A recent S&P Global report says that the wait for gas plant turbines is five to seven years. A solar facility can be built in a fraction of that time. 
As we roll back industrial and financial strategies to build a homegrown renewable energy manufacturing economy and make energy more affordable, China will run laps around us. Yes, as fossil fuel supporters will tell you, China has built plenty of coal plants in recent years. They’ve also built tremendous amounts of solar and wind, which made up more of their energy share than coal in 2024, according to Carbon Brief. 
I haven’t been shy on my stance on this year’s data center legislation and what I believe are its potential impacts on county and school budgets (by taking revenue that would have belonged to them) or on the environment, but it’s what we have now, and I don’t doubt massive data centers will be built in our state. I don’t understand why people in power wouldn’t want them to use clean energy so they don’t pollute communities with chemicals from natural gas and diesel. 
That’s why one big, beautiful bill is going to be a bad deal for West Virginians. By cutting off energy incentives at the knees, our electric prices are projected to increase and jobs will be lost. As data centers encroach on our state, they’ll use dirty energy or otherwise put strains on our grid. All because of the terrible combination of an untrue antirenewable energy ideology and wanting to give tax cuts to the rich.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case.


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”
The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

Scopes, charged with teaching about evolution during a biology lesson at Rhea County High School. (Photo by Topical Press Agency/Getty Images)Today I’m remembering what Lela Scopes told me about her famous brother for my Paducah Sun story going on 46 years ago.
She said before John Thomas Scopes left to teach science and coach football at Rhea County High School in Dayton, Tenn., in 1924, he explained, “I’m going there because it’s a small town with a small school where I won’t get in any deep water.”  
The skinny, bespectacled, freckle-faced 24-year-old from Paducah ended up the defendant in one of history’s most sensationalized courtroom battles.  
A century ago this month, Scopes was convicted of violating the Butler Act, a Volunteer State law that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools. His punishment was a $100 fine. 
But the “Monkey Trial” grabbed newspaper headlines worldwide. Dozens of reporters converged on Dayton. So did tent revivalists and swarms of hucksters hawking popcorn and pink lemonade and hustling Bibles and souvenirs, including stuffed monkeys.

“The State of Tennessee v John Thomas Scopes” was also the first trial broadcast live on radio.
I interviewed Lela Scopes in August 1979, when I was a Sun feature writer. She also said John had worried about what their mother might think of the trial: “He was afraid it would get in the Louisville paper, Mother would read about it and think he was a hothead.”
Anyway, as Mark Twain said, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” and now is one of those rhyming times.
“Public education is once again under siege from a sustained effort by Christian Nationalists to blur the line between church and state,” warns A.J. Schumann, a youth organizing fellow with Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
Like today, the 1920s were times of “rapid social, economic and cultural change,” said David Krueger, professor emeritus of history at West Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah. 
Scopes admitted he covered evolution when he substitute taught for the absent biology teacher. (In their zeal to ban evolution, Tennessee lawmakers failed to remove the state-approved biology textbook, which included evolution.)
Scopes believed in evolution and agreed to stand trial on principle. 
The trial, which began on July 10, 1925, and concluded on July 21, was essentially a clash of competing values: urban science and modernism versus rural, old-time Protestant fundamentalist Christianity.

“The cause defended at Dayton is a continuing one that has existed throughout man’s brief history and will continue as long as man is here,” Scopes wrote in “Center of the Storm,” his 1967 memoir. “It is the cause of freedom, for which man must do what he can.”
The attorneys embodied the collision of values. Tennessee summoned William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska as special prosecutor. A fundamentalist champion, he had been a Democratic congressman, secretary of state and three-time Democratic presidential candidate. 
The American Civil Liberties Union hired Clarence Darrow to lead Scopes’ defense team. Darrow was widely considered the country’s top defense lawyer. He was from Chicago, believed in evolution and was an agnostic.
Bryan and Darrow dueled like gladiators in the sweltering midsummer East Tennessee heat. The courtroom became so hot that the trial was moved outdoors to the tree-shaded courthouse lawn where the crowd of spectators grew even larger.
Bryan got a conviction as expected. But progressives, including liberal Christians, believed science and reason had vanquished “EVIL-lution” in the court of public opinion. They pointed to July 20 when Darrow called Bryan to the stand as a Bible expert.
“There was no pity for the helplessness of the believer come so suddenly and so unexpectedly upon a moment when he could not reconcile statements of the Bible with generally accepted facts,” The New York Times reported. “There was no pity for his admissions of ignorance of things boys and girls learn in high school, his floundering confessions that he knew practically nothing of geology, biology, philology, little of comparative religion, and little even of ancient history.” 










 ... separation of church and state is not something we can take for granted. It is a principle that must be actively defended, especially in moments of cultural anxiety and political division, when calls to return to some mythic past grow loudest.” 


– A.J. Schumann, Americans United for Separation of Church and State


In “Only Yesterday,” his 1931 chronicle of the 1920s, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote:  “Theoretically, Fundamentalism had won, for the law stood. Yet really Fundamentalism had lost. Legislators might go on passing anti-evolution laws, and in the hinterlands the pious might still keep their religion locked in a science-proof compartment of their minds; but civilized opinion everywhere had regarded the Dayton trial with amazement and amusement, and the slow drift away from Fundamentalist certainty continued.”
Allen and the progressives of his day missed the mark. Donald Trump and his Republican Party owe a big part of their electoral success to white Christian evangelicals of the “God said it. I believe it. That settles it.” persuasion.  
Schumann warned that “today’s Christian Nationalist rhetoric echoes the anti-modernist anxieties of the 1920s — fear that secularism is destroying ‘traditional values’ and that public institutions should reflect a ‘Christian America.’” 
He wrote that the First Amendment safeguards all Americans “from having any single belief system imposed on them by the state,” a fact that seems to be lost on much of the GOP these days.  
Schumann concluded that the Scopes “trial reminds us that the separation of church and state is not something we can take for granted. It is a principle that must be actively defended, especially in moments of cultural anxiety and political division, when calls to return to some mythic past grow loudest.”
Scopes died in 1970 at age 70. He is buried in the family plot in Paducah’s Oak Grove Cemetery next to his wife, Mildred, and close to Lela, who died in 1989 at 92. “A Man of Courage” is his epitaph. A state historical marker at the cemetery’s main entrance tells about him.

Scopes said not a word during the trial. He got his chance at the end.
After the jury delivered the expected guilty verdict and the judge fined Scopes $100, one of his lawyers pointed out that the defendant had been denied the right to speak before sentencing. 
“Your Honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute,” Scopes said. “I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideals of academic freedom, that is to teach the truth as guaranteed in our Constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.” 
After Scopes finished, the judge repeated the fine. The verdict was later overturned on a technicality, Schumann wrote, but the Butler Act wasn’t repealed until 1967.

While the changes won’t kick in for more than a year, Virginia lawmakers are already preparing for the transformation of the state’s health care landscape.
It’s still unclear exactly how many Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage because final analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) haven’t dropped yet. The uncertainty has left many wondering if they or loved ones will be impacted — and set the stage for partisan bickering. 
Democrats have warned for weeks that over 332,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the bill made its way through Congress.
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday that figure is  “literally made up,” while other Republicans have pointed to a  7-year-old state study, conducted before Virginia expanded its Medicaid program in 2018, to claim far fewer would be booted from Medicaid. 
Clearer understandings of just what will happen to Medicaid in Virginia and other states may be best found in future OMB reports but its most recent estimates found 10.8 million Americans nationwide could lose insurance as a result of the bill 
 ‘A moving target’

The bill’s rapid race over the finish line, from the House to the Senate to Trump’s desk in a span of mere weeks, could be the root of confusion about its full impact concerning health care, and lawmakers’ differing interpretations. Analysts and organizations tracking the legislation also tried to keep pace. 
“We did do far more analysis of the bill as it passed the House back in May, including a conventional estimate, a dynamic analysis, information on the distributional effects, health insurance loss estimates, information on SNAP benefit changes, etc.,” Caitlin Emma, chief of media relations for CBO, wrote in an email. “Things started moving quickly once the bill headed over to the Senate and the demands on CBO during the legislative process started to ramp up.”
Freddy Mejia, a policy director with The Commonwealth Institute, noted the whiplash lawmakers and analysts experienced trying to keep track of the House and Senate versions of the OBBB. 
The impact between the two different bills is “kind of a bit of a moving target,” he said. 
He plans to keep an eye out for further reports from CBO now that OBBB has fully passed. 
On a national scale, Democrats have stressed that the number of Americans facing the loss of their Medicaid coverage could be close to 17 million. This, Emma said, is because CBO created another analysis with provisions that weren’t in the bill that passed, but which could also have an effect: expiration of ACA premium tax credits and a proposed Health and Human Services rule for marketplaces. 
“Both of those we totaled at 5.1 million, which is why you subsequently saw a lot of Democrats adding 10.8 million + 5.1 million to get nearly 16 million, or adding it to our Senate total to get nearly 17 million,” she said. 
Beyond just health insurance, CBO estimated that in general, resources would decrease for lower-income households while increasing for middle class and higher-income households. That supposition, however, stems from the House version of the bill, supported by Virginia Republican U.S. Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland, which did not become law. Fresh CBO review could reveal how people in different income brackets will fare with the new law overall. 
 Old data, new frustrations

State Republicans’ allegations that Democrats’ Medicaid coverage loss estimations were inflated first circulated as the big beautiful bill wound through congress. This week, the debate came to a head with Youngkin accusing Democrats of “extreme assumptions” at an event announcing a slate of regulatory reductions on Tuesday.
“The number that Democrats are throwing around on Virginians who will lose their health coverage is made up,” Youngkin said Tuesday while talking with the media at the event. “They choose extreme assumptions in every measure.”
It’s unclear what data Youngkin is using to refute Virginia Democrats’ Medicaid loss estimates and members of his staff did not respond when asked.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Virginia’s House of Delegates have cited n a 2018 study from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). Garren Shipley, a communications staffer for the House Republican Caucus, shared the study with emphasis that the party doesn’t believe mass disenrollment would happen because of Congress’ bill. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Like CBO, JLARC is a nonpartisan research entity in state government that lawmakers often tap to study various issues. The 2018 JLARC study Shipley referenced came the same year Virginia expanded its Medicaid program. 
At the time, JLARC estimated that about 32% of Virginia’s Medicaid expansion population would be subject to work requirements and 7% would be deterred from enrolling or leaving the program due to the requirements. 
As the JLARC study is over seven years old, it’s likely some of its estimations are no longer relevant or accurate. What is certain, however, is that changes to Medicaid requirements and hospital funding mechanisms are on the horizon. 
 Work requirements, risk to hospitals

Youngkin also framed the work requirements as an important part of Medicaid reform. It’s something state lawmakers had initially considered when expanding the program seven years ago. The new law will require those receiving Medicaid benefits to work XYZ brief description of work requirements, which some lawmakers and advocates say are either unnecessary because many recipients already work, or needlessly burdensome to those living with a disability.
“Redetermination is a really important process,” he said. “It asks us to redetermine every six months, and that gives us a chance to assess who’s gotten a job, (and) who hasn’t complied with the work requirements.”
Youngkin emphasized how Medicaid is supposed to ensure that the “deeply impoverished,” mothers, and children have health insurance rather than able-bodied people “who can get a job and have simply chosen not to.” 
Most Medicaid recipients do work, though some like Richmond-area resident Andrew Daughtry, currently do not. A construction worker, he’s tapped into Medicaid for surgeries to recover from an injury that’s left him temporarily unable to work. Earlier this summer he said that it felt “insulting” to have his work ethic questioned.
The twice-yearly employment verification is meant to kick people off their insurance if they aren’t able to keep their jobs while the phase-down of Medicaid provider taxes and state-directed payments are also meant to curb costs for the federal government. 
But hospitals warn of heightened chances for closures — particularly in rural areas —- or trimming of offered services and staff. Several hospitals in Southwest and South Side Virginia had already closed obstetrics units, for example, prior to the new congressional bill.
Virginia’s state budget will fund OB-GYN medical residencies amid obstetrics closures

Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, reflected on the intent of the Affordable Care Act — a hallmark law of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency that allowed states to expand their Medicaid eligibility to provide health care to more people to begin with.  The law was about keeping people insured and healthy in order to keep everyone’s bills down. 
“The impact is not exclusive to the Medicaid population,” Walker said. “It has ripple effects.” 
He noted that uninsured people are likely at or closer to poverty levels than insured people. Without health coverage, they’re more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise. 
Walker said people’s conditions are likely to be worse by then — requiring more resources between staff, medications, treatments and length of stay in a hospital. Longer stays mean less available beds for others, regardless of Medicaid status.
Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, remained vocal on social media throughout the reconciliation process to warn that some hospitals would be strained and likely to close. Sometimes, he tagged Virginia’s congressional Republicans, whose districts include rural hospitals and sizable amounts of Medicaid patients. 
Hospitals are also federally required to provide care regardless of whether someone can pay their bills or not, so they absorb that cost while also trying to offset it. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private health insurers, Walker said rates will likely go up for employers and employees with private insurance. 
“Different constituencies may feel the impacts differently,” Walker said. “Some more than others — but this has potential to have much more far-reaching implications.”

(Photo by Jim Morrison for the Virginia Mercury)When Erik Neil moved to Norfolk to become president of the Chrysler Museum of Art, he’d experienced the threat posed by the climate crisis to museum collections. Six months prior to Hurricane Katrina, he led an effort r to find safe storage for the Newcomb Art Gallery collection at Tulane University in New Orleans. Just in time.
The Chrysler Museum sits at the culmination of The Hague, an inlet of the Elizabeth River, a postcard-perfect location for decades. But that beauty belies an increasingly sinister reality. In recent years, rising tides and intensifying rainstorms repeatedly submerged streets, threatening the museum and its decade-old addition, the Perry Glass Studio. 
“We’ve never had water in the building on the first floor,” said Neil, who has watched the water rise over the past decade. “But we are in this low-lying area, and there are these creek beds underneath and culverts and all of that. The roadways can become impassable on a nice sunny day. It doesn’t have to be a storm. It can be the tides and a full moon flooding. I lived in New Orleans for seven years, so I wasn’t unfamiliar with that aspect of life.”
Fast forward two decades from his days in Louisiana and Neil has overseen an evolving master plan to protect the museum and its collection in a city that is second behind  New Orleans as most threatened by the effects of a warming world. 
“It was clear how vulnerable that the museum is,” said Thom White, design principal at Work Program Architects, the Norfolk firm that created the plan. “There’s a culvert that goes right under the museum, and they’ve got priceless works just sitting there knowing that flooding happens all the time.” 
White’s sister remembers being stranded, trapped at the museum because the water rose so quickly around it during a storm. “Right off the bat, we were working on ways that we could protect the collection, protect the grounds,” he added.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Chrysler is not alone in facing the threat. Data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services shows that more than one-third of U.S. museums and related organizations are within 60 miles of a coastline; a quarter of those sit near highly vulnerable coasts. A survey commissioned by the Mellon Foundation reported that 35% of museums experienced damage from the climate crisis. But only half of those have prepared to protect against those damages.
The Smithsonian Institution museums have a plan. The Whitney Museum of American Art has raised the level of its floors, removed all permanent exhibitions from the first floor and recruited a firm that manufactures watertight doors for the Navy to build floodgates for its loading dock on the river. The Baker Museum in Florida installed a hurricane-resistant facade. 
But for smaller museums, addressing climate change can be difficult because of the cost. Not the Chrysler.
The museum has made modifications to the main building, creating a floodgate that can be erected, moving the art in storage to the second floor and elsewhere and creating plans to raise walkways and streets, although that’s an expensive solution destined for future decades.

When the Chrysler embarked on a recently-completed $30 million expansion of The Perry Glass Studio across the street from the main building, resilience was at the forefront. 
“You can’t fight Mother Nature,” Neil said. “We needed to be very, very sensitive to the idea that we needed to build in a way that was suited.”
To combat the floods, the 21,000-square-foot expanded portion of the studio is four feet higher than the first phase. The building sits on soft fill, but rather than using piles or other foundations, it rides on an innovative foundation called rigid inclusions.
Robert Crawshaw, a senior architect from Work Program Architects, the firm that designed the expansion, described it as a large bed of nails, 470 in this case, created by boring a huge needle 100 feet down and then backfilling it with concrete to form a solid foundation. 
The site also features a rain garden encircling the building’s entrance that holds floodwaters, so they slowly percolate into the soil, only releasing into the city’s beleaguered stormwater system when the garden is overwhelmed. The adjacent parking lot has been graded so runoff flows into the rain garden. A stormwater drain was raised to stop tidal flooding from flowing up through it, inundating the street. 
The project had the space to create an urban rain garden, something rare in Norfolk, a city that is largely built out with impermeable parking lots or buildings. The designers made the rain garden a work of entrance art, with visitors walking up an ascendant serpentine path. It’s an example of learning to live with the water, something often talked about in Norfolk. 
“As part of Chrysler’s master plan, they wanted to say, we’re on the front of this and we’re dealing with it,” Crawshaw said. “So, we didn’t want to hide the rain garden on the back of a property. We wanted you to be immersed in the efforts that the Chrysler was doing.”
Moving was a part of the conversation for the museum’s resilience masterplan, but was rejected, according to White.
“The Chrysler Museum is such a part of the identity of Norfolk in that location, and the power of its connection to the community is worth keeping it there,” he said. “Doing things like the expansion of the glass studio builds greater connections to the community. And so, for as long as it can be here, we want to try to keep it.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Chrysler-Museum-1_Jim-Morrison-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-07-10 06:01:09.171202

(Nicholas Monteleone/ FEMA)In the wake of deadly flooding in central Texas and New Mexico that claimed over 100 lives with nearly 200 still missing, scrutiny of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster recovery services and funding, has mounted. 
Before the floods, the federal government had announced plans to eliminate or remake the agency and is now reviewing its procedures, funding, and execution of agency missions, a process in which Virginia’s governor is taking an active role. 
Virginia agencies assist Texas flood recovery, share how state prepares for dangerous weather events

As part of an executive order from President Donald Trump, the FEMA Review Council is analyzing the emergency response agency for potential changes or reductions. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was appointed to the council and now serves on a subcommittee that will report on the roles of localities and other agencies outside of FEMA when it comes to disaster response.
The goal is to create better communication and to put more of the recovery responsibilities on the shoulders of the states.
“We will be receiving inputs from governors, from local leaders, from emergency response personnel, and, of course, from the review council itself,” Youngkin said. “I think we will be able to chart a very clear delineation of the way things work today,” Youngkin added, noting the  “deep challenges” of FEMA’s current system and the group’s goal to “shift responsibility to the states and therefore move FEMA from being a supplant role into a support role.”
Traditionally  before disasters, FEMA  promotes emergency preparedness and provides the National Flood Insurance Program. They also help stage resources in areas where a known storm such as a hurricane is headed towards.
During an event that received a presidential disaster declaration, the agency helps provide recovery centers to disseminate resources as well as funding application locations across the affected areas. The agency works with local and state resources to aid affected communities in the immediate and long-term aftermath of a disaster.
Following Hurricane Helene last year, Virginia was awarded over $18 million from FEMA for individual and household programs. However, low-income families did not often meet the threshold for FEMA funding, leaving them in the lurch when trying to build back their lives. The agency has drawn the ire of Trump and other Republicans, despite some analysts and state officials framing FEMA as a critical resource whose assistance states would likely not be able to replicate on their own.
“Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” Trump said in his executive order establishing the review council.
Youngkin said in his statements to the council on Wednesday that during the response to devastating flooding it was unclear what FEMA would provide in addition to other federal agencies. 
“How do we move forward with haste in order to meet our citizens’ needs when we don’t really even know how much the resources are going to be to provide the answers to the basic needs of housing, food, and recovery. This is the work that we are undertaking,” Youngkin said.
FEMA has had to deal with a growing number of high-dollar disasters across the country leading to strained services and slower response times. That is on top of reductions in funding from the federal government under the second Trump administration, which have impacted flood resiliency projects, National Weather Service staffing, and other programs in Virginia. 
As mandated by the executive order, the council’s final report will include a review of FEMA’s disaster response in the last four years, comparing FEMA’s response to how local and state agencies responded to the same disasters, what programs were in place before FEMA, and how the agency can be more of a support than the main response to disasters. 
The order does not explicitly state when a final report is due, and a date wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s meeting, but the council is only ordered to exist for one year.

North Carolina got yet another frightening wake-up call this week about global warming when a modest tropical depression suddenly exploded over the state.
Chantal dumped up to 10 inches of rain in some areas, causing widespread flooding and massive damage.
And while it’s true that there’s nothing new about bad weather, it’s also true that as scientists have repeatedly told us, the frequency and severity of modern storms (like Hurricane Helene) is being greatly worsened by climate change.
Simply put, warmer air holds more water and produces more frequent and intense downpours. And when this situation is combined with aging and obsolete infrastructure and warning systems, disaster often results.
Amazingly and maddeningly however, Republican leaders in Washington and Raleigh are not only doing nothing to address the crisis, they’re making it worse with laws that discourage renewable energy and promote more fossil fuel consumption.
The bottom line: the need for all Americans to rise up and demand an immediate reversal of these disastrous policy choices could not be more urgent.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio emergency doctors say that low-income people won’t be the only ones to suffer amid concerns that Medicaid cuts signed by President Donald Trump will cost hundreds of thousands of Ohioans their health insurance.
Taking away insurance won’t reduce emergency-room visits, doctors say. Instead, the giant jump in the number of uninsured Ohioans will increase ER trips as those people lose access to primary care. Many will wait until they’re so sick they have to go to the emergency room to see a doctor.
“When Medicaid is cut, those people don’t stop getting sick or injured,” said Dr. Christina Campana, president of the Ohio Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians. “They keep showing up to the emergency department because they have nowhere else to go.”
She added that the cuts will harm hospitals in ways that will increase negative health outcomes and preventable deaths for everyone.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will cut taxes by $5 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits by $3.8 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.
To get deficits down to even that high level, the bill cuts $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over the period, and about $287 billion in federal food assistance, according to KFF.
The result: The richest 1% of Americans will get $30,000 more a year on average, while the poorest 20% will get $700 less, according to the Yale Budget Lab.
The law is highly unpopular, with polls showing it to be underwater by an average of 23 percentage points. In a seeming admission of that unpopularity, the deepest of the safety net cuts won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections.
After that — and possibly before — huge numbers of Ohioans and other Americans will feel the pain, advocates say. 
The Medicaid cuts will cost Ohio $6.45 billion over 10 years, according to KFF. And one way that could eventually manifest is by tripping a switch that Gov. Mike DeWine signed into the state budget on June 30. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, states could expand the population covered by Medicaid, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost. Forty states, including Ohio, have subsequently done so.
Under the Ohio law signed by DeWine, if federal payments cover less than 90% of the cost of the expansion, the state can end it. That would cost 770,000 Ohioans their health coverage. Most of those people work.
Right now, advocates say, the trigger language on Ohio’s expansion group won’t be invoked by the cuts signed by Trump, but the federal cuts will still impact more than 400,000 Ohioans.
One place the hammer will fall most heavily is the emergency department. That’s because under the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, it has to treat all emergencies, whether people have insurance or not.
“Emergency departments are the safety net of our health care system,” said Campana, who is herself an emergency department doctor.
So if hundreds of thousands of low-income Ohioans are suddenly uninsured, emergency rooms will have to care for a lot more people who can’t pay.
“It’s going to leave Ohio in the lurch — especially the most vulnerable patients,” Campana said. “It doesn’t save money in the long run. It just shifts costs. Worse outcomes. Driving more people to the emergency department. It’s penny wise and pound foolish.”
Ohio hospitals generally and rural ones in particular are already struggling. The Ohio Hospital Association in May told the legislature that half of Ohio hospitals and 72% of rural hospitals have reported operating losses since 2022.
Eleven rural hospitals are listed as at risk for significant financial distress due to the cuts, Democratic U.S. Senators wrote in a letter to Trump and Republican leaders.
Campana said that if those covered by expanded Medicaid are suddenly uninsured, “it’s going to be orders of magnitude worse. We’re already on a thin sheet of ice. I think there’s going to be more unnecessary deaths and the amount of preventable things is going to be really hard for health care workers to stomach.”
She explained how all patients will be hurt. At her hospital, about 66% of the people who show up in the ER are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, or both. About 20% have private insurance, and the remaining 14% are uninsured. 
“So when you cut Medicaid, you’re increasing  the number of people who are uninsured, and decreasing reimbursements,” Campana said, explaining that will force hospitals to cut costs. “When you trim costs, you actually end up cutting care. So the way the hospital deals with this is they end up cutting staffing. It forces hospitals to make really hard choices. They have fewer staff, longer wait times, and in some cases, communities losing access to health care altogether. Particularly in small, rural communities.”
One consequence goes by a bland, administrative name: patient “boarding.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
It occurs when the ER doc wants to admit a patient to the hospital, but an appropriate bed isn’t available. So the patient has to wait in the ER, sometimes in a hallway — probably not where you want to lie for hours when you’re really, really sick.
“It’s like a traffic jam,” Campana said. “We can’t move people out, but there’s dozens of people coming through our doors every hour. That’s what makes for really long wait times.”
Negative health outcomes increase with wait times. 
“It’s terrible care for people, but that’s what boarding does, and we’re in a boarding crisis currently,” Campana said. “They don’t get the right care because the emergency department doesn’t have the capacity and resources to perform inpatient medicine.” It “has been shown to increase mortality and increase complications. So we know that it’s not good for patients.” 
For example, a 2020 paper published in Critical Care Medicine reported that especially for the sickest patients, the longer you’re boarded in the ER the more likely you are to die.
Patient mortality among those sick enough to be admitted to intensive care rose from 37.6% for those immediately admitted to 43.4% if they had to wait in the emergency department between two and 12 hours. Death rates rose steadily from there, with an appalling 57.1% of patients who had to wait 24 hours or longer never making it home from the hospital.
Similarly, mortality rates have been shown to increase the longer patients have to wait in the emergency department for initial treatment.
“We’ve had some really bad things happen in our waiting room because patients had to wait a long time,” Campana said. “Even as severe as death. It’s crazy. This is right now, before Medicaid cuts. All of that will worsen and we’re trying to sound the alarm, but that alarm is falling on deaf ears.” 
U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted, both Ohio Republicans, voted for the bill containing the Medicaid cuts. Their staffs were asked whether the senators agreed that the Medicaid cuts would increase wait times and degrade care for emergency patients throughout Ohio and close some rural hospitals.
Neither staff addressed wait times or quality of care for all Ohioans.
“Senator Moreno was proud to support President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which gave working families a tax cut and delivered $1.3 billion in funding for Ohio Medicaid providers and recipients as part of the multi-billion dollar support fund in the bill,” Moreno’s communications director, Reagan McCarthy, said in an email. “Liberal media hacks should tell the truth about what this bill actually does instead of parroting Democrat talking points to instill fear in their readers.”
Husted Press Secretary Olivia Tripoldi pointed to a press release in which the Ohio Hospital Association praised the Ohio senators for helping get the $1.3 billion rural-hospital subsidy into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
However, the extra support for rural hospitals won’t make Ohio whole. 
Husted’s press release didn’t give a time frame for the disbursement of the $1.3 billion, but it’s part of $50 billion appropriated nationally over a five-year period. 
That would just cover the $1.25 billion rural hospitals will lose in Medicaid over that period, according to an Ohio Hospital Association fact sheet. Even with the additional money, Ohio will still lose nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid payments over the same period, based on KFF’s 10-year estimates. If the rural hospital subsidy isn’t extended, Ohio would lose another $3.2 billion the five years after that.
And, despite the subsidy, 86,000 rural Ohioans will still lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, according to the Ohio Hospital Association.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Obleness-21.jpg,,,2025-07-10 05:06:20.039039

There have been many proposals to reform the system in recent years, but some feel that looking to New Hampshire for its Office of the Child Advocate could offer the most promising solution.
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) introduced LD 1893 in early May. The bill would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children. 
Although the Legislature adjourned in late June, the Health and Human Services Committee decided to hold onto the bill until next session, which is slated to begin in January. 
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency the Office of Child and Family Services, said at the public hearing that it would also like more time to consider the proposal because of the “extensive reach” it could have throughout state government. 
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth beyond just child welfare. This could extend to the Departments of Education, Corrections or any other agency providing services to or arranging services on behalf of a child.
Moira O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire and served as its first child advocate before stepping down in 2021, told Maine Morning Star that the language in LD 1893 is far better compared to the first iteration of New Hampshire’s law. She also pointed out that the legislation proposes the essential components of ombudsman work: independence, impartiality, access to information and confidentiality. 
As O’Neill sees it, children and their interests don’t have a seat at the table under Maine’s current child welfare infrastructure. She pointed out that there are children in Maine who are hungry, abused, neglected and will be saddled with long-term effects to their health, employment and relationships. 
“They need someone who is just for them — not a part time cabinet, not a caring governor, not a legislative committee — but one person whose only job is to hear children, know their best interest, and speak on their behalf,” she said. “It must be an independent someone who is beholden only to the children and the statute.
Though the department spoke neither for nor against LD 1893, it said it is interested in exploring the model as a way to strengthen oversight. It also acknowledged that there are already multiple avenues for oversight including federal regulations, legislative oversight and citizen advisory panels. 
Oversight and root causes
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple attempts to restructure the state’s child welfare system. This has included multiple failed legislative attempts, including just last year, to separate the OCFS from DHHS. 
Last year, OCFS frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership.
The bill language presents a shift from policing to promoting better practices, including for state agencies, O’Neill explained. 
“You can’t prosecute and fire your way through a system weakness,” she said. “When systems are weak due to lack of funding, work force, training, effective policy, etc., the best solution generally comes from collaborative efforts that enhance support for systems and repairs weaknesses.”
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, said she prefers the proposed Office of Child Advocate model because it does not solely focus on the child welfare system.
“This office taking that bigger picture view felt more promising to me than some of the other proposals that have really, in my opinion…felt reactionary,” Hackett said.
She appreciates that the Office of Child Advocate would build upon the oversight provided by the existing child welfare ombudsman office, while having the ability to explore the root causes that could lead a family to being involved with the system. 
That could create what Hackett described as a “both-and” approach to provide oversight and address the systemic factors like substance use disorder or mental health that can bring a family in contact with the child welfare system. But she said that will require public and political will to understand what is really happening with children and families.  
Hackett said the proposed child advocate would be able “to really look up from a high level down at what’s happening on the ground to see these trends and to not be singularly focused on one incident or case but to be able to look across those trends to say, ‘This is what we need to really address and this is how we address it to stem the flow of these kids coming into these systems.’”
Confidentiality in child welfare
The Office of Child Advocate could also provide a solution for the ways confidentiality complicates child welfare oversight. 
In August 2022, the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee asked DHHS to view records relating to the 2021 deaths of four children. The department denied the committee access, citing confidentiality laws. 
After that denial, the committee filed an action in the Kennebec County Superior Court urging the department to comply with its subpoena. The court denied the committee’s request, ruling that it did not have the authority to access the confidential records. 
The committee appealed the decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which held a hearing in December 2023 before ruling in line with the lower court decision.
Because of that decision from the state’s highest court, Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) put in a bill last session seeking to allow the committee to access “privileged and confidential” records while keeping them exempt from public disclosure. That proposal was also carried over by the Judiciary Committee to be worked on further next session. 
O’Neill said the independent child advocate role outlined in LD 1893 is a better solution than opening up legislator access to that sort of confidential information. That person wouldn’t be influenced by partisan priorities and can serve as a “resource for children and families navigating seemingly unfriendly systems,” she added.

Now, a freeze announced by the Trump administration has cast uncertainty over that federal funding stream and a number of others.
In a message to state education agencies last week that included the New Hampshire Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Education said it is putting on hold $6.8 billion across five funding programs that were supposed to be awarded to schools July 1. The federal department is reviewing the grant applications to ensure “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities and the department’s statutory responsibilities” before it makes final award decisions, the message states.
On the list of grant programs that have been frozen: Title II-A, which helps pay for teacher professional development; Title III-A, which helps fund English language learning; Title IV-A, which pays for some STEM education and college and career counseling; and Title IV-B, which funds after-school and summer programs. 
In Nashua, the second-largest school district in the state, the funding freeze affects more than just English language programs. It will also tie up funding for reading specialists, instructional coaches, math interventionists, and family engagement coordinators, said Mario Andrade, the Nashua School District superintendent. 
“Everything that’s in those grants is supplemental (and) we feel is going to be needed and urgent for our kids,” Andrade said in an interview. “So any kind of loss in any of those fields is going to have a big impact on how we support students in our community.”
Manchester, the state’s largest district, could also suffer cuts. Last year, the district received $390,000 in funding to help its 2,400 English language learning students, and $4 million overall across the frozen funding categories. 
Any cuts could affect the school’s before- and after-school programs, which serve around 1,000 students and employ 38 staff, the district’s superintendent’s office said in a statement. They could also impede the district’s partnership with St. Anselm’s ACCESS Academy, which provides college-level courses to create a pathway for underprivileged students to go on to higher education. 
And smaller districts are affected, too.
Pelham School District does not have enough English language learners to apply for Title III-A grants, nor does it operate summer or after-school programs that could qualify for Title IV-B. But the district does rely on the funding for teacher development programs, says Superintendent Chip McGee.
For instance, in the interest of improving math proficiency scores on state assessments, the district is using last year’s $45,642 Title II-A allocation to train its math teachers in the “OGAP system,“ McGee said in an interview. That system is designed to change the way math teachers approach basic concepts such addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and how to help students who are falling behind. 
But the district must pay the organization that created OGAP, OGAP Math LLC, for the training programs, and this summer it used its Title II-A funds to do that.
“It’s really about all of the ways kids can get confused and help them get back on track,” McGee said. “It’s very deep in the weeds, but I think it’s the place we need to go if we’re going to intervene with struggling students.” 
Pelham is using the funds to improve reading education, too. It has paid for professional development from the University of Florida Literacy Institute, or “U-FLI,” to train teachers on evidence-based literacy instruction. This year, 50 out of 51 elementary school teachers attended that training, McGee said.
“And this cut would simply mean that furthering that work can’t happen for new staff,” he said.
It is not clear whether the federal Department of Education plans to eliminate the funds, reduce them, or fully award them after its review, nor is it clear when the department might make that decision. In an email to schools last week, New Hampshire Department of Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut advised districts to use the funds they had but to not plan on the other funds while they are reviewed. 
“We recognize that this situation brings uncertainty to budgets and program planning,” Edelblut wrote to schools. “(The New Hampshire Department of Education) is actively working with federal partners and internally to support your students and staff. We remain committed to timely communication as updates emerge.” 
Not all of the federal assistance funds are frozen. In June, the U.S. Department of Education approved the release of $46.3 million in Title I-A funds to New Hampshire schools, according to the state education department — about $1.7 million more than the state received the previous year. That tranche of money goes to schools with low-income populations and helps to increase resources for students most at risk of academic underachievement.. 
McGee says he thinks it’s unlikely that the federal department will cut the funding under review entirely, but he predicts the $6.8 billion of allocations will be whittled down significantly. If that happens, Pelham will try to stretch the money it does get to cover some of the teacher training, but there might be reductions or consolidation, McGee said.
Other districts might have to make more painful decisions. 
If the federal funding were not approved, Nashua would need to lay off some or all of the staff the funding pays for, or cut into other programs to find money, according to Andrade.
The district already approved its budget for the 2025-2026 school year with the expectation of receiving the federal grants, and it is not able to raise revenue midway through the budget to save those positions if the funding does not go through, according to Andrade.
“We’re not, at the point yet to make any kind of speculations on where we would go, but we are in communication with the city,” Andrade said. “This is on the horizon.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mirandausdeptofed-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 05:06:20.039039

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Cities, states say they’ll need more help to replace millions of lead pipes

Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
‘Time for a reckoning.’ Kansas farmers brace for water cuts to save Ogallala Aquifer.

In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.











I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade



While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-10 09:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘They Beat Me Like a Slave’: Signs of Violence in Sheriff’s Office Dated Back Years,Nate Rosenfield and Mukta Joshi,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/10/rankin-sheriff-fbi-signs-violence/,"The FBI and a Mississippi sheriff investigated complaints about brutal assaults, but the deputies accused remained on the force and never charged.","Nate Rosenfield and Mukta Joshi are reporters for Mississippi Today. They examined the power of sheriff’s offices in the state as part of The Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship.

For nearly two years, the embattled sheriff of Rankin County, Mississippi, has tried to distance himself from brutality in his department, saying he was unaware of assaults like those carried out by deputies who called themselves the Goon Squad.
But department records and interviews with a former FBI agent reveal that the sheriff, Bryan Bailey, had evidence of his deputies’ violent acts going back to his earliest days in office.
In 2012, the year Bailey became sheriff, the department and the FBI had reviewed video footage of a deputy ramming his car into a teenager fleeing arrest and threatening to kill him.
Eight years later, a man sued the department claiming that deputies hit him with a metal rod and shoved a gun in his mouth while he was handcuffed.
Then, in 2022, a deputy was caught on video using his Taser to shock a handcuffed man in the back of a patrol car.
The Rankin County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that it had investigated all three cases, and so had the FBI. One of the deputies involved was suspended and another was reassigned, but none of them were fired, and none faced prosecution. Several were later tied to violent raids by the Goon Squad or were convicted for their roles in torturing two men, Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins, in 2023.

The handling of the three earlier cases reveals how the Sheriff’s Department allowed officers accused of serious violence to remain on the force and that federal authorities chose not to act, despite strong evidence supporting the allegations.
Jason Dare, the lawyer for the Sheriff’s Department, defended its handling of misconduct investigations, saying the cases show that the department worked with federal agencies to promote “constitutionally permissive policing while keeping crime in check.”
He said that each of the cases had been investigated by the FBI and that none of them “resulted in a finding of impropriety.”
The Sheriff’s Department came to national attention in 2023, when five deputies were charged with breaking into a home and then handcuffing, beating and sexually assaulting Parker and Jenkins.
At the time, Sheriff Bailey expressed shock that deputies he trusted could be involved in such brutality. “Never in my life did I think it would happen in this department,” Bailey said during a press conference.
In an article that year, Mississippi Today and The New York Times detailed the allegations of dozens of people who said they had witnessed or experienced similar assaults at the hands of Rankin County deputies, many of them assigned to a patrol shift that called itself the Goon Squad. Months later, the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the department.
This year, during depositions taken as part of a lawsuit, Sheriff Bailey said he had no reason to think that the violence was widespread, although he acknowledged that the department did not have a centralized system to track the complaints it received. He said the FBI never indicated that there were problems at the department.
But the FBI and Sheriff Bailey were aware of allegations of misconduct by Rankin deputies, including some who would later be sentenced along with members of the Goon Squad.

In two of the three newly revealed cases, video taken by cameras mounted in patrol cars supported allegations of excessive force. In one of those cases, two officers also said in 2012 that they had held down a robbery suspect while another deputy beat him, contradicting their initial reports on the use of force, according to Jeffery Artis, the FBI agent who investigated. Dare said the FBI never informed the department of its findings.
Artis, now retired, had been assigned to civil rights violations in Mississippi for nearly a decade. He said video taken from a patrol car showed Daniel Warren, then a deputy in Rankin County who was not associated with the Goon Squad, ramming his car into Justin Archie, a teenager who had run from the police after committing an armed robbery. Artis said the video also showed Warren shouting that he was going to kill the teenager. He said the video evidence alone showed “100 percent unnecessary, excessive force.”
Two other deputies involved in the arrest told Artis that Warren had used a slapjack — a weapon typically made from leather and filled with metal weights — to beat Archie while they held him down and tried to handcuff him.
In 2013, Archie, who is Black, filed a lawsuit laying out the details of the beating and accusing Warren, who is white, of shouting racial slurs at him during the attack.
Dare said he could not locate the video from Archie’s arrest, which he noted occurred 14 years ago.
Dare said that a previous lawyer for the department was present during two interviews the FBI conducted with the deputies and that the deputies did not admit to misrepresenting facts during any sessions attended by the department’s lawyer.
After Artis turned his case over to federal prosecutors, they did not seek to indict the officers. The U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of Mississippi and the Justice Department declined to comment.

Even without criminal charges, Sheriff Bailey could have fired the deputies involved, but they kept their jobs. Warren was reassigned to animal control, according to Dare.
Warren continued to work for the department for more than a year. Then, in 2013, a jail inmate on work detail found Warren’s car unlocked with the keys and a gun inside and used it to escape, department records show.
Warren, who did not respond to requests for comment, was terminated the next day.
After Warren’s departure — and years before the public first learned of the Goon Squad — Dorothy Johnson said she called the FBI to report that her son, Carvis Johnson, had been beaten by Rankin County deputies in 2019.
In 2020, Johnson sued the department. His lawsuit accused a group of deputies, including Brett McAlpin and Christian Dedmon — who became central figures in the Jenkins and Parker case — of beating him with their fists and a metal rod during a traffic stop.
As in several assaults that other victims later described, a deputy put his gun in Johnson’s mouth while he was handcuffed, according to the lawsuit.
“They beat me like a slave,” Johnson wrote in his complaint.
Although deputies did not mention any use of force in their arrest reports, a photo taken of  Johnson while he was in jail shows his face bandaged and swollen.
Again, FBI agents got involved. After Johnson’s family reported the incident to the bureau, agents interviewed him in jail in 2020, he and his mother said. The deputies were not charged.

Dare said that the department also investigated and found that Johnson’s statements were contradictory and that the evidence “did not show that discipline was warranted.”
The FBI declined to answer questions about the case. Johnson said in a 2023 letter to a judge that his lawsuit had been settled for $30,000, which Dare disputed without providing further details.
The Johnson family’s lawsuit was one of a string of allegations spanning two decades against McAlpin, a high-ranking detective whom federal prosecutors described as the ringleader of the Goon Squad during his sentencing for the torture of Jenkins and Parker. 
In the years leading up to his conviction, McAlpin had been named in at least four lawsuits alleging that he had used excessive force.
Johnson’s lawsuit accused Jamie Perry of sticking a gun in his mouth and James Rayborn of beating him. The deputies were listed in department records as present during multiple arrests, previously reported by Mississippi Today and The Times, where victims said they were waterboarded, shocked with Tasers or beaten while restrained. State records show that Perry resigned in good standing in 2021 and Rayborn still works at the Sheriff’s Department.
Rayborn declined to comment for this article. Perry could not be reached for comment.
Just five months before the Jenkins and Parker incident, department leaders reported a deputy to the FBI after he was caught on tape shocking a handcuffed man.
Records show that the deputy, Hunter Cook, was suspended for two weeks and temporarily reassigned before returning to the same patrol shift alongside members of the Goon Squad. He was not charged.
Cook resigned more than a year later, after the U.S. attorney charged other deputies in his unit with unrelated crimes.
Cook had written in his initial report on the incident that he used his Taser on Ryan Irwin — who had led deputies in a high-speed chase before accidentally striking and killing a motorcyclist — because Irwin was resisting the officers and turned his head “in a very aggressive manner while puckering his lips” as if to spit at him.
Cook was part of a private text thread reviewed by reporters that included more than one department supervisor and several of the deputies later convicted of torture.
When Mr. Cook announced in the chat that he was returning to his patrol shift, a deputy typed, “Man caught a charge and beat it.” Another deputy replied, “About time.”
Weeks before the torture of Jenkins and Parker, the group joked in the text thread about a recent arrest made by Cook.  One deputy asked whether he had shocked that suspect in the face. Cook replied that he had tackled the man as if in a football video game, calling it “so fun.” In response, the group’s commanding sergeant said, “Good job guys.”
Dwayne Thornton, the former undersheriff at the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, said during a sworn deposition that the department reported Cook’s conduct to the FBI. Irwin said that no one from the FBI interviewed him, even though his lawyer contacted the bureau.
The FBI declined to comment.
Thornton testified that the department decided to fire Cook after learning about another excessive force incident.
In an interview, Cook said that this second incident occurred before Irwin’s arrest and that the department had not previously taken issue with it.
“I take full responsibility for my actions,” Cook said. But he said he “was singled out just to try to make the department look better.”
He said that he had been promoted a year after the Taser incident, but was suddenly forced to resign when the department came under scrutiny because of the Goon Squad.
In September 2024, when the Justice Department announced a wide-ranging investigation into the Sheriff’s Department, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said federal authorities had received multiple reports that deputies had “overused Tasers, entered homes unlawfully, bandied about shocking racial slurs, and deployed dangerous, cruel tactics to assault people in their custody.”
Months later, the Trump administration withdrew from nearly all of its investigations into civil rights violations at law enforcement agencies. The administration has said that some of the cases had sought overly broad restrictions that would prevent the agencies from aggressively enforcing laws.
The Justice Department declined to respond to questions about whether its investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department had been terminated.
“The Trump administration is essentially giving a green light to police abuse and unconstitutional policing,” Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, said in a statement. “If the agency that allowed the Goon Squad to operate for years doesn’t warrant federal investigation, no law enforcement agency does.”

The two struck up a conversation about getting involved in the community, something that had been in Sandra’s heart since moving from Stamford to Bridgeport in 1989.
Helping people had always come naturally to her. She grew up dreaming of working in corporate America, especially in human resources, where she could guide and support others. “I’ve always had a passion for helping people level up and gain resources to better themselves,” she said.
It was Crawford-Tyner who first told her about the Parent Leadership Training Institute, or PLTI. “She just started listening to me,” Carmichael said. “She said, ‘I think I have a platform for you and your family.’ That one conversation changed everything.”
Carmichael enrolled in PLTI alongside her husband and youngest son. While going through the program, the site coordinator at the time, Donna Thompson-Bennett, pulled her aside. She was struck by Carmichael’s energy, insight, and drive to make a difference — and encouraged her to become a facilitator after graduation.
She did. Now, more than two decades later, Sandra serves as PLTI’s Bridgeport site coordinator, helping other parents discover the same power and purpose she found. “I really started having an eye opener,” she said. “I realized I could do something big and different with my life. This program helped me find my purpose.” 
 She remembers her first few sessions vividly. The energy in the room, the strong leaders surrounding her, and the moment she began to see herself differently.
“I just remember the parent leaders that were in the room. Anything I get involved in, I’m always thinking about how I can connect with people,” she said. “I’m a great connector and networker — always promoting and believing in people, encouraging them to do what they want to do. And I didn’t even realize people were watching me too — seeing something I didn’t even see yet.”
For more than 25 years, the Parent Leadership Training Institute has quietly transformed the lives of Bridgeport families, staff and participants say. Through its companion program, the Children’s Leadership Training Institute, it has built a movement rooted in self-advocacy and generational change.
Carmichael has since become a certified facilitator, site coordinator, and mentor to hundreds. “This work lets me be boots on the ground,” she said. “People trust me. I get to hold their hands through real-life struggles and help them find the resources to move forward.” 
Staff say this is not just a leadership class. It’s a lifeline — a 22-week course in public speaking, civics and community organizing. And it is free to those who need it most. Each year, parents commit to learning how to turn their personal challenges into public leadership and they all complete projects. Alongside them, their children learn the same values in the CLTI, tailored to their own experiences.
It’s work that goes beyond the classroom. Carmichael has helped parents access laptops, Wi-Fi, transportation, and child care. “We make it possible, not just convenient,” she said. “Because life is hard. But we believe parents deserve to dream and lead, even through the hardest seasons.”

Gina LeVon Simpson has been part of PLTI since it came to Bridgeport in 1998. She helped lead its launch and eventually became the national consultant for CLTI. Her passion is with watching the kids grow into leaders beside their parents. “The curriculum is parallel,” Simpson said. “Whatever the parents learn, the children learn at their level. Through stories, art, music, even basketball.”
Simpson remembers a 5-year-old girl who started a coat drive after learning to define a community problem. And a quiet boy on the autism spectrum who asked his school to host an autism awareness event — the first time many had ever heard him speak. “Parents are in tears when they see what their kids can do,” Simpson said. “This is what transformation looks like.”
The issues these families face are not new. “We’re still advocating for the same things we did 27 years ago,” said Simpson. “Books in schools, safe neighborhoods, resources that other towns take for granted. But now, we have generations of leaders. Parents and children who know how to fight for what’s right.”
Carmen A. Nieves is one of those leaders. When she moved to Bridgeport from Stamford, friends and people in her circle said she wouldn’t make it. But PLTI changed her path. “I didn’t know anyone. My job was gone. My house was gone. But I found this program, and it changed my life,” she said.
Nieves’ class project was the East Side Resource Exchange, which eventually became the Community Network Center, located in the Department of Labor office, a hub of support still operating today. Nieves described the East Side Resource Exchange as an “in person 211.” For example, if a parent was moving, someone was buying a car, or looking for affordable housing options or benefits, they would help them with resources in their new neighborhood.
“I created my own job,” she said. “We got computers from the IRS, training from Info Line. We made 2,500 referrals in the first year alone.”
Now a facilitator herself, Nieves teaches the second half of the curriculum, which focuses on policy, systems and power. “Phase I is emotional,” she said. “Phase II is action. I push parents to take their ideas to the mayor’s office, to the media, to the people who make decisions.”

She knows not every parent will complete their project. But the goal is deeper than that. “It’s about building confidence,” Nieves said. “It’s about believing you have the right to be heard and the tools to make that happen.”
Tamara Titre was a part of this year’s graduating class and knows the value of those tools. As an attorney, she came to PLTI with professional training, but she left with something more. “It was about community,” she said. “It was about filling each other’s buckets. I got just as much as I gave.”
Her children went through CLTI alongside her. Her 13-year-old goddaughter, once introverted, found a voice. “The leadership I saw in her and my son was incredible,” Titre said. “They’re not the same kids they were when we started.”
For Titre, PLTI’s power lies in the relationships. “You build connections with other parents. You learn to listen and to be listened to,” she said. “And you carry that with you.”
At the heart of PLTI is the belief that everyone has the potential to lead and that leadership starts with love, according to Carmichael. Bridgeport parents have turned that love into action. They’ve launched coat drives. Pushed for school reform. Built resource centers and community gardens. They’ve stood in front of city councils and school boards and said, “Here’s what we need. Here’s what we’re going to do.”
And they’ve brought their children with them.
“This program meets you where you’re at,” said Carmichael. “It stretches you. It helps you believe in yourself. And then it shows you how to make your dreams real. For yourself, your kids, and your community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PLTI-BPT-0624-DE-254-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 05:06:20.039039

Ohio Equal Rights, the group behind the amendment, can now either challenge the ruling through the Ohio Supreme Court or collect 1,000 signatures for each of the two amendments and petition Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to certify the title and summary language. 
One amendment would eliminate Ohio’s ban on gay marriage in the state’s constitution. 
The other amendment would add language to the state’s constitution protecting citizens from discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status. 
“It seems to me reasonable that there are voters in Ohio that may be supportive of repealing the marriage agreement, so to allow, in the Ohio constitution, the institution of marriage between any two loving couples that want to be together, but that may not want to support creating 12 new protected classes under a bunch of different listed circumstances,” said Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said during Wednesday’s Ballot Board meeting. “And so in order to provide voters that choice, it seems apparent to me that it would be good to give them those two as two separate amendments,” 
Republican state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, LaRose, and Ballot Board member Tony Schroeder, also an Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee member, voted in favor of splitting the amendment. 
Ohio Equal Rights did not immediately know if they were going to challenge the ruling in an attempt to get it back to one issue or go forward as two separate amendments. Republicans hold a 6-1 majority on the Ohio Supreme Court. 
“That is a conversation within our leadership team and with our legal counsel as to what our next steps are,” said Lis Regula, with Ohio Equal Rights. 
He doesn’t agree these are two separate amendments. 
“How can you say that you have equal rights if people are not allowed to marry the person that they love and benefit from the privileges of marriage?” Regula said. “This amendment is in line with that view of making Ohio welcoming to all and making sure that we don’t continue losing people to other states that are more willing to let people be who they are and let people live their lives while also protecting their rights.”
Ohio Equal Rights is trying to get on the 2026 ballot, which will also include the governor’s race and other statewide executive offices. 
Yost certified the title and summary language on July 3 after Ohio Equal Rights submitted 2,000 signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on June 30. They needed to submit 1,000 valid signatures from registered Ohio voters.
Corey Colombo, a lawyer with McTigue & Colombo, testified during the meeting about how the proposed amendment  “all relates to the single general purpose of equal rights of all Ohioans.”

“I have a hard time, and maybe clarify exactly, how is it the same purpose to allow biological men in the same locker room as girls, when they’re not consenting, how is that the same general purpose as allowing people of the same sex consensually to get married?” Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, asked Colombo after his testimony. 
Colombo said there’s nothing in the language that specifically discusses bathrooms. 
“Everything in this proposal fits under the umbrella of equal rights of all Ohio,” he said. 
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, and state Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland, voted against breaking up the amendment.  
“This is simple, in my opinion,” Upchurch said to reporters after the meeting. “This is about protecting all Ohio’s under the law. … Whenever we’re able to get this on the ballot, it’s my intention to stand beside these folks to get this done.”
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015 through the Obergefell case originating out of Ohio. 
However, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called on justices to revisit Obergefell after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
“People don’t necessarily understand that the status of marriage equality in Ohio right now is entirely dependent on Obergefell,” Regula said. “If it changes, I think there’s going to be a lot of people who are surprised … cousin Joe and his husband aren’t married anymore. … That is a rude awakening that I don’t want to see people have to struggle with.”
Regula said they modeled their language off of Nevada’s Equal Rights Amendment that voters passed back in 2022.

Legal and health policy experts say the court’s June ruling upholding a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors leaves the door open for other challenges — and restrictions. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization, or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”
The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman has announced a bid to override Gov. Mike DeWine’s property tax vetoes. The House plans to take up three of the governor’s vetoes in a July 21 session, but the notice leaves the door open for more overrides down the line.
Ohio House lawmakers and advocates calling for property tax reform howled at DeWine’s decision to strike out provisions aimed at lowering tax bills by taking target at local levies.
The governor cut a measure giving county officials authority to roll back voted levies as well as changes to the way levies get calculated. He also vetoed limits on the kind of levies school districts can put on the ballot and the amount of cash districts can carry over year-to-year.
The House wants to override all but the carryover provision.
In a press conference outlining his vetoes DeWine argued imposing those changes, “all of them at once on our local schools, would create a huge, huge problem.”
DeWine insisted the vetoes don’t “lessen our obligation” to deal with rising property taxes, and he proposed a new working group to come up with recommendations.
That suggestion apparently rung hollow for many Republican lawmakers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The General Assembly stood up a joint committee just last year that held several hearings and issued a report with more than 20 recommendations. On social media, state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, argued “We do NOT NEED A WORKING GROUP. We need ACTION.”
Outside of the planned override vote, Fischer and state Rep. Beth Lear, R-Delaware, want to put a measure on the ballot capping property taxes.
Ohio Democrats, meanwhile, criticized the GOP for complaining about property taxes after advancing provisions to fund a new NFL stadium and deliver tax cuts that benefits the state’s highest earners.
“Governor DeWine saw through the sham and knew these provisions would hurt our public schools and local governments, and that’s why he vetoed several of them,” Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn said.
“If Republicans were serious about real property tax relief they wouldn’t pass the buck,” he added. “They would use this session to vote on bipartisan, commonsense solutions that would make a real difference.”
What are lawmakers trying to override?
DeWine scrapped a budget measure granting new authority to county budget commissions — three-member panels made up of the local auditor, treasurer, and prosecutor. In particular, the governor opposed changes allowing commissioners to reduce voter-approved levies.
State lawmakers also wanted to restrict what kinds of levies school districts can get on the ballot in the first place.
Replacement levies, fixed-sum or substitute emergency levies, and combined income and property tax levies would all be prohibited under the state budget. DeWine argued those measures are “important tools” for school districts and vetoed the provision.
The governor also turned down a change to the way school district millage gets calculated.
It’s complicated.
Ohio’s constitution grants jurisdictions the authority to levy up to 10 mills in property taxes. A mill is one thousandth of a dollar, so 10 mills is 1% of a property’s value. Anything beyond that 10-mill limit needs voter approval.
Last year in Columbus, for instance, a typical residential homeowner saw an effective rate of about 49.6 mills.
Naturally, as property values rise, the same millage brings in more money. So, in the 1970s Ohio lawmakers created a kind of brake on those kinds of increases. They created a reduction factor bringing down rates, so homeowners’ bills held steady.
Importantly, those reductions can’t bring a school district’s tax rates below 20 mills. If property values rise high enough, the rates can’t get reduced any further.
School districts found a work around in certain levies that aren’t subject to the reduction factor. The state budget would’ve required those additional levies to be counted as part of the 20-mill floor. The change would mean some districts that were previously at the floor would have room for additional reductions.
DeWine rejected that change.
Outside reactions
Tom Zaino, a former state tax commissioner who heads up the Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition, lobbied lawmakers for changes to the 20-mill floor calculation.
He said the budget “goes a very long way in addressing” what his group was seeking. But Zaino insisted they’re not trying to undercut school districts’ revenue, but they want to ensure those levies are subject to reductions, not growing with property values.
“It is only tamping down inflationary growth in revenues,” he argued, “and they still can go back to the voters. None of their current revenues go away or anything like that. So, they can still go back to the voters and get more revenue if they can justify that with the voters.”
Zaino admitted some discomfort with county budget commissions rolling back voted levies — DeWine’s justification for a different veto — but argued an agency could file an appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals.

Zaino noted his coalition, which has the backing of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and Ohio Realtors, would like to see lawmakers override all four of the governor’s property tax vetoes.
That includes a provision capping at 40% of operating revenue the cash reserves districts can carry into the following year.
Donovan O’Neil, who leads Americans for Prosperity Ohio, said the planned override vote shows lawmakers “commitment” to taxpayers.
“These commonsense reforms were crafted to stop the unchecked growth of property taxes and restore a stronger voice for voters,” he said. “Lawmakers are doing the right thing by fighting to get them back on the books.”
But Scott DiMauro thinks the override effort is misguided. The high school social studies teacher and president of the Ohio Education Association argued the state budget put public schools in a massive funding hole.
“What the governor did was just help mitigate the damage,” he said. “Not only was the legislature underfunding schools in terms of state funding, they were also trying to solve their property tax problem on the backs of Ohio’s public school students.”
He argued the provisions DeWine vetoed were “half baked” and that it’s “disappointing” some lawmakers in the majority are eager to double down on bad policy.
“We hope that common sense will prevail,” he said, “and this veto override effort will fail.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/download-35-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 05:06:20.039039

The 2021 law at issue in the case, Ohio Senate Bill 260, prohibits telemedicine abortions, and the lawsuit has since been amended by the challengers to include laws that keep not only doctors but “advanced practice clinicians,” like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, from virtually prescribing mifepristone, which is used for medication abortions.
Under the original law for which entities like Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the ACLU of Ohio sued, physicians could be charged with a fourth-degree felony for a first offense of providing abortion-inducing drugs via telemedicine, and a third-degree felony for subsequent offenses.
The ACLU and Planned Parenthood argued that certain statutes regarding medical licensure in Ohio Administrative Code and Ohio Revised Code “could be read to preclude (advanced practice clinicians) from providing medication abortion care,” even with two other court orders withholding enforcement of the telemedicine abortion law.
Hamilton County Judge Alison Hatheway agreed, saying the regulations taken together with other provisions “could be read to preclude otherwise qualified (nurse practitioners) or (certified nurse midwives) from providing medication abortions merely because they are licensed by the Board of Nursing, not the (State) Medical Board.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hatheway said the plaintiffs in the case “have shown a substantial likelihood they will succeed on their claims that they and their patients’ constitutional rights are being violated,” leading to her decision to once again temporarily stop the law as the case goes forward.
The ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court decided that a lawsuit challenging expanded access to mifepristone couldn’t continue, and the drug could continue to be available nationwide.
Since the original state law on telemedicine abortion care was enacted, a constitutional amendment was passed by voters in Ohio that legalized the right to abortion in the state, which judges in Hamilton County and elsewhere have used to strike down laws like the state’s six-week abortion ban and a requirement that a patient wait 24 hours after having an appointment about an abortion procedure to have the procedure itself.
Hatheway noted the constitutional amendment in her ruling on the medication abortion case, saying, under the amendment, “patient health is the only state interest that an abortion regulation may constitutionally advance.”
“Therefore, any restrictions on abortion must be narrowly tailored to further protect patient’s health and such restrictions must be the least restrictive means to advance the patient’s health ‘in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards,’” Hathaway wrote, referencing the amendment.
The judge added that the amendment “grants sweeping protections ensuring reproductive autonomy for patients in Ohio,” and that in the case “substantial evidence” was provided by the challengers that the law on virtual medication abortions violates the constitutional amendment “and actually causes harm to plaintiffs and their patients.”
She noted that the state permits advanced practice clinicians to prescribe the exact same medication for “other non-abortion purposes,” like miscarriage management.
The parties challenging the law were “relieved” by the decision, saying advanced practice clinicians are “completely qualified to provide medication abortions under their state licensure and should not be punished by the state for providing vital care to patients in line with their scope of practice,” according to a statement by the ACLU, the ACLU of Ohio, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and Planned Parenthoods of Greater Ohio and the Southwest Ohio region.
Anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life called the decision “reckless judicial interference in women’s health” and said the group is confident “pro-life Attorney General Dave Yost will have ample ground to appeal this decision all the way to the Supreme Court.”
“It’s tragic that women’s lives will hang in the balance while lawyers instead of doctors make these decisions,” the Ohio Right to Life statement said.
Pro-abortion rights advocates have said there are still dozens of laws on the books that regulate abortion in a way that is against the language of the constitutional amendment, and the groups plan to fight against all of them.
Alternatively, Democratic lawmakers in the Statehouse are trying to codify reproductive rights in state law as well, along with repealing some of the “archaic laws in our state that do not improve outcomes or access to care,” state Rep. Anita Somani said when she helped announce plans for legislative action.
The measures have an uphill battle in a Republican supermajority whose members have supported legislation that would undermine the constitutional amendment, and even most recently put up an effort to establish a total abortion ban in the state.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio educators are speaking out after Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that would remove their voices from the retired teachers’ pension fund, calling the move “undemocratic.”
Lawmakers say that the current board can’t be trusted, as there is an ongoing lawsuit accusing the board chair of corruption.
After four decades of service, public school teacher Barry Alcock retired with his pension benefits, which he relies on.
“I’m a retired, single teacher,” Alcock said. “My income, everything I get, is from me and it’s from my pension and whatever else I have. I can’t imagine losing it.”
He keeps up with what the State Teachers Retirement System board does, trusting that the teachers on the board are looking out for educators.
However, a last-minute change to the state budget eliminates a majority of voices like his on the board.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for active educators, and only one retiree seat will be available.
“That’s our pension system,” Alcock said. “That is absurd.”
Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once they term out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled.
Those four removed-educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Under the budget, the treasurer would get two appointees, the legislative leaders get one each and one combined — equalling three, the chancellor of the Department of Higher Education gets one, and the governor and DEW get one each.
This provision was proposed by state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council. For months now, he has been evaluating the board makeup due to the controversy inside the fund.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Bird said. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, was among those unhappy with how the pension fund has been run.
“I think there’s been pretty widespread concern about some of the management of the state teachers’ retirement system,” Stewart said.
He is referencing Attorney General Dave Yost’s civil suit to remove Rudy Fichtenbaum, the STRS board chair.
How we got here
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both public corruption schemes and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to DeWine alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former members Wade Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time. The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
We have continued investigating the alleged scheme throughout the past year, resulting in an exclusive one-on-one interview with DeWine. He expressed his deep concerns following our April 2025 report, in which we revealed hundreds of text messages about the relationship between Steen and members of QED.
Steen and Fichtenbaum have continued to defend their innocence, arguing that Yost and DeWine are part of a “political scheme” to prevent educators who want more transparency and to change the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.”
This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.
Removal
Lawmakers had been discussing changes for months, primarily in private.
“It’s not good policy to have investment decisions for a public pension being made by people who are directly benefited by those decisions,” Stewart said.
Pensioners say they reached out in droves to DeWine’s office, but in early July, he signed the provision into law.
During an exclusive one-on-one back in April, we asked DeWine what he thought about this proposal.
“Well, I’m not advocating any kind of change,” DeWine responded. “The board members are not experts, their job is to hire experts… There’s no reason that every member of that board has to be an expert in investment, but they have to hire the right people.”
But on Tuesday, the governor’s team said that he was having conversations with lawmakers about changing the makeup of the board to better safeguard the funds.
“The legislators have been discussing budget provisions with (DeWine) for several months, and usually they come sometime before the actual amendments are dropped,” the governor’s spokesperson, Dan Tierney, said. “He certainly gets appropriate courtesy and heads up on where things are coming… They would try to work collaboratively.”
Through text, Fichtenbaum said that the lawmakers’ action was “a disservice” to educators.
“I believe the legislative change to the make-up of the STRS Board is totally undemocratic, a disservice to members, and will erode confidence in the system,” Fichtenbaum texted. “It was done in the middle of the night as part of the budget reconciliation process, although neither the House nor the Senate budgets had any proposals on changing the make-up of the Board. There were no hearings, no opportunities for members or the public to weigh-in on this legislation before it was passed.”
We brought the timing up to Tierney, as the provision was broken by our reporting at 1 a.m. the day of the full chamber votes.
“The idea that we have direct democracy on every issue is just factually inaccurate,” Tierney said, noting that voters participate in the democratic process by electing lawmakers to introduce legislation like this provision.
Current STRS Acting Executive Director Aaron Hood seemingly took the news better than Fichtenbaum.
“STRS Ohio respects the legislature’s decision to restructure the Board,” Hood said in a statement. “We remain committed to collaborating with state lawmakers to ensure the smooth implementation of these governance changes, while steadfastly upholding our mission to provide a secure financial future for our members.”
Hood, who was meant to be interim, is being replaced shortly by Steven Toole, the previous head of the North Carolina Retirement Systems.
Alcock said he feels stuck. He doesn’t agree with the decisions that Fichtenbaum and the reformers on the board are making.
“I want the investments to be sound. I want them to be legitimate. I don’t want any of my money being used for an investment experiment,” he said, referencing QED.
On the other hand, he doesn’t trust the legislators.
“Teachers don’t need to be taken care of by legislators. We know what our best interests are,” Alcock said. “(Lawmakers) don’t have a really good record of protecting our best interests in the first place.”
The law is set to go into effect in late September, but the changes won’t be made until the first of the educators’ term off in 2026.

(Getty Images)Five Sedgwick County Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center officers held a 135-pound, 17-year-old Cedric “C.J.” Lofton face down, pressure on his back, until he died in 2021. The Sedgwick County coroner ruled the death a homicide. No one was even arrested, let alone prosecuted.
A panel of U.S. Court of Appeals judges, however, ruled that the detention personnel could not “sidestep an excessive-force lawsuit filed against them,” Kansas Reflector reported.
Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett, who declined to charge the detention personnel, should face accountability, too. Prosecutors are the most powerful people in the legal system, yet, like police officers, rarely face the kind of culpability they foist on others. 
Kansas Reflector asked Bennett if he had a response, but he declined, saying he could not comment on pending litigation.
The appeals court spoke with the kind of clarity hoped for but missed in the aftermath of Lofton’s death. Activists rallied the community. Organizations lent support to groups demanding justice. Gov. Laura Kelly ordered an investigation.
But Bennett didn’t budge, arguing, as though he were representing his fellow county government employees, that detention personnel stood immune from prosecution under the state’s “robust stand your ground law.”
We’ve seen prosecutors go to great lengths to justify prosecutions, but here, we saw prosecutorial discretion contorting itself like a game of Twister.
The detention officers, Jason Stepien, Brenton Newby, Karen Conklin, William Buckner and Benito Mendoza, should have had to face a judge or jury, but Bennett made the decision that they would not.
Consider these concerning red flags. 
Detention personnel are law enforcement, and prosecutors tend to maintain cozy relationships with law officers.
Lofton was restrained for nearly 45 minutes, roughly 10 minutes longer than Bennett’s report noted, according to video footage. One employee restraining Lofton told police he’d applied weight to Lofton’s back.
Also, according to the Wichita Eagle, a former Wichita police officer who changed his answers on a form to leave Lofton at the juvenile lockup where he died had his license revoked.
The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training, which oversees officer certifications, posted the four-page revocation for Ryan O’Hare.
These represent obvious red flags under the standard of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. It felt like a coverup.
Steven Hart, a Chicago-based civil rights attorney representing Lofton’s family, told the Eagle the decision not to prosecute was “morally bankrupt.”
“Essentially what Marc Bennett is suggesting is, ‘You did it to yourself, kid,’ ” Hart told the Eagle.
Hart continued: “You’re going to believe on face value what (the county employees) say? Since when has a district attorney said, ‘An accused said he didn’t do it, so he didn’t do it?’ ”
I’d spoken to Bennett a few weeks ago not only about not prosecuting this case but his more recent decision not to prosecute a young white woman involved in a car accident that killed a young Black man from Emporia.
I asked how he’d respond to suspicions of bias in these cases where young Black people died and no one was prosecuted.
“To compare the two unrelated incidents is baseless,” Bennett said. “As was fully explained at the time in a press conference and a report, the decision in the Lofton matter was based on the law of the state of Kansas — to suggest it was because ‘less weight’ was placed on his life is offensive.”
The families missing those young men might find it offensive that no one was held accountable, and frankly, labeling this perspective “baseless” feels cold and dismissive. It also read as though he should not be questioned. Citizens have a duty to question elected officials.
It’s important to note that Bennett’s no outlier. In our legal system, while district attorneys serve as elected officials, complaints against them tend to land in front of sympathetic panels of former prosecutors.
Kansas Reflector also has followed the shenanigans of Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay, who, despite video evidence to the contrary, emphasized that a man carrying a socket wrench and moving away from officers had charged those officers with a raised knife.
Interestingly, the same lawyer defending those Topeka officers, Jeffrey Kuhlman, represented the juvenile detention officers, too.
In 2022, Lofton’s brother, Marquan Teetz, filed a federal lawsuit alleging staff used excessive force against Lofton. Kuhlman argued Lofton wouldn’t have died had he not resisted in a manner that resulted in exposure to “an air deficit.”
An air deficit? You mean suffocation? What a euphemism for homicide.
This ruling offered hope, but our society worships law enforcement, generally refuses to hold them accountable, and doesn’t value the lives of its lower caste. This was clear in Bennett’s exoneration of detention personnel and blaming Lofton for struggling to survive.
Donald Black’s “The Behavior of Law,” written in 1976, said the offender-victim combination drove decisions. Black argued legal system behavior was “quantifiable, predictable, and follows deducible general rules.”
The most prosecuted cases? In descending order: Black on white crime, white on white crime, white on Black crime, and Black on Black crime. So, from his last breath, the quantifiable, predictable and deducible general rules meant Lofton’s killers likely would escape prosecution.
They should have been prosecuted, and the appeals court seemed to agree.
Court of Appeals Judge Carolyn McHugh, writing for Judges Richard Frederico and Allison Eid of the 10th Circuit, said: “Defendants had sufficient control over (Lofton). At that point, a reasonable officer would have perceived the threat had passed and that the use of deadly force was no longer reasonable. Instead, five officers continued to subject Mr. Lofton to a prone restraint while his legs were restrained, and he appeared not to move for prolonged periods.”
This seemed obvious to almost everyone, except Bennett.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1704450317-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 05:06:20.039039

Vance Boelter, who allegedly shot Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband, Mark Hortman, on June 14, 2025, studied at Christ for the Nations Institute in Dallas. The group is a Bible school linked to the New Apostolic Reformation, or NAR.
The NAR is a loosely organized but influential charismatic Christian movement that shares similarities with Pentecostalism, especially in its belief that God actively communicates with believers through the Holy Spirit. Unlike traditional Pentecostalism, however, the organization emphasizes modern-day apostles and prophets as authoritative leaders tasked with transforming society and ushering in God’s kingdom on Earth. Prayer, prophecy and worship are defined not only as acts of devotion but as strategic tools for advancing believers’ vision of government and society.
After the shooting, the Christ for the Nations Institute issued a statement “unequivocally” denouncing “any and all forms of violence and extremism.” It stated: “Our organization’s mission is to educate and equip students to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through compassion, love, prayer, service, worship, and value for human life.”
But the shooting has drawn attention to the school and the larger Christian movement it belongs to. One of the most important aspects of NAR teachings today is what is called “the Seven Mountain Mandate.”
The Seven Mountain Mandate calls on Christians to gain influence, or “take dominion,” over seven key areas of culture: religion, family, education, government, media, business and the arts.
With over three decades of experience studying extremism, I offer a brief overview of the history and core beliefs of the Seven Mountains Mandate.
 ‘Dominion of Christians’

The Seven Mountains concept was originally proposed in 1975 by evangelical leader Bill Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ. Now known as “Cru,” the Campus Crusade for Christ was founded as a global ministry in 1951 to promote Christian evangelism, especially on college campuses.
United by a shared vision to influence society through Christian values, Bright partnered with Loren Cunningham, the founder of Youth With A Mission, a major international missionary training and outreach organization, in the 1970s.
The Seven Mountains Mandate was popularized by theologian Francis Schaeffer, who linked it to a larger critique of secularism and liberal culture. Over time, it evolved.
C. Peter Wagner, a former seminary professor who helped organize and name the New Apostolic Reformation, is often regarded as the theological architect of the group. He developed it into a call for dominion. In his 2008 book “Dominion! How Kingdom Action Can Change the World,” he urged Christians to take authoritative control of cultural institutions.
For Wagner, “dominion theology” – the idea that Christians should have control over all aspects of society – was a call to spiritual warfare, so that God’s kingdom would be “manifested here on earth as it is in heaven.”
Since 1996, Bill Johnson, a senior leader of Bethel Church, and Johnny Enlow, a self-described prophet and Seven Mountains advocate, among others, have taken the original idea of the Seven Mountains Mandate and reshaped it into a more aggressive, political and spiritually militant approach. Spiritual militancy reflects an aggressive, us-vs.-them mindset that blurs the line between faith and authoritarianism, promoting dominion over society in the name of spiritual warfare.
Their version doesn’t just aim to influence culture; it frames the effort as a spiritual battle to reclaim and reshape the nation according to their vision of God’s will.
Lance Wallnau, another Christian evangelical preacher, televangelist, speaker and author, has promoted dominion theology since the early 2000s. During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Wallnau, along with several prominent NAR figures, described Donald Trump as anointed by God to reclaim the “mountain” of government from demonic control.
In their book “Invading Babylon: The 7 Mountains Mandate,” Wallnau and Johnson explicitly call for Christian leadership as the only antidote to perceived moral decay and spiritual darkness.
 The beliefs

Sometimes referred to as Seven Mountains of Influence or Seven Mountains of Culture, the seven mountains are not neutral domains but seen as battlegrounds between divine truth and demonic deception.
Adherents believe that Christians are called to reclaim these areas through influence, leadership and even, if necessary, the use of force and to confront demonic political forces, as religion scholar Matthew Taylor demonstrates in his book “The Violent Take It By Force.”
Diverse perspectives and interpretations surround the rhetoric and actions associated with the New Apostolic Reformation. Some analysts have pointed out how the NAR is training its followers for an active confrontation. Other commentators have said that the rhetoric calling for physical violence is anti-biblical and should be denounced.
NAR-aligned leaders have framed electoral contests as struggles between “godly” candidates and those under the sway of “satanic” influence.
Similarly, NAR prophet Cindy Jacobs has repeatedly emphasized the need for “spiritual warfare” in schools to combat what she characterizes as “demonic ideologies” such as sex education, LGBTQ+ inclusion or discussions of systemic racism.
In the NAR worldview, cultural change is not merely political or social but considered a supernatural mission; opponents are not simply wrong but possibly under the sway of demonic influence. Elections become spiritual battles.
This belief system views pluralism as weakness, compromise as betrayal, and coexistence as capitulation. Frederick Clarkson, a senior research analyst at Political Research Associates, a progressive think tank based in Somerville, Massachusetts, defines the Seven Mountains Mandate as “the theocratic idea that Christians are called by God to exercise dominion over every aspect of society by taking control of political and cultural institutions.”
The call to “take back” the culture is not metaphorical but literal, and believers are encouraged to see themselves as soldiers in a holy war to dominate society. Some critics argue that NAR’s call to “take back” culture is about literal domination, but this interpretation is contested.
Many within the movement see the language of warfare as spiritually focused on prayer, evangelism and influencing hearts and minds. Still, the line between metaphor and mandate can blur, especially when rhetoric about “dominion” intersects with political and cultural action. That tension is part of an ongoing debate both within and outside the movement.
 Networks that spread the beliefs

This belief system is no longer confined to the margins. It is spread widely through evangelical churches, podcasts, YouTube videos and political networks.
It’s hard to know exactly how many churches are part of the New Apostolic Reformation, but estimates suggest that about 3 million people in the U.S. attend churches that openly follow NAR leaders.
At the same time, the Seven Mountains Mandate doesn’t depend on centralized leadership or formal institutions. It spreads organically through social networks, social media – notably podcasts and livestreams – and revivalist meetings and workshops.
André Gagné, a theologian and author of “American Evangelicals for Trump: Dominion, Spiritual Warfare, and the End Times,” writes about the ways in which the mandate spreads by empowering local leaders and believers. Individuals are authorized – often through teachings on spiritual warfare, prophetic gifting, and apostolic leadership – to see themselves as agents of divine transformation in society, called to reclaim the “mountains,” such as government, media and education, for God’s kingdom.
This approach, Gagné explains, allows different communities to adapt the action mandate to their unique cultural, political and social contexts. It encourages individuals to see themselves as spiritual warriors and leaders in their domains – whether in business, education, government, media or the arts.
Small groups or even individuals can start movements or initiatives without waiting for top-down directives. The only recognized authorities are the apostles and prophets running the church or church network the believers attend.
The framing of the Seven Mountains Mandate as a divinely inspired mission, combined with the movement’s emphasis on direct spiritual experiences and a specific interpretation of scripture, can create an environment where questioning the mandate is perceived as challenging God’s authority.
 Slippery slope

These beliefs have increasingly fused with nationalist rhetoric and conspiracy theories.
A powerful example of NAR political rhetoric in action is the rise and influence of the “Appeal to Heaven” flags. For those in the New Apostolic Reformation, these flags symbolize the belief that when all earthly authority fails, people have the right to appeal directly to God’s authority to justify resistance.
This was evident during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when these flags were prominently displayed.
To be clear, its leaders are not calling for violence but rather for direct political engagement and protest. For some believers, however, the calls for “spiritual warfare” may become a slippery slope into justification for violence, as in the case of the alleged Minnesota shooter.
Understanding the Seven Mountains Mandate is essential for grasping the dynamics of contemporary efforts to align government and culture with a particular vision of Christian authority and influence.

The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case.


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
 Sex-based protections

The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
 ‘Scientific and policy debates’

Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

Data shows that many of those in immigration detention have no criminal history. (Photo by by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Thirty-four cities and counties, including Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda.
The expansion of the case could be a sign that more cities are seeing the benefit of suing to protect their rights in court from a Trump administration that is often acting without regard for legal precedent.
A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits nationwide injunctions means that cities and states must be part of a lawsuit to get the benefits of any injunction that would stop such policies while the legal merits are debated in court.
The federal judge in the case, William Orrick of the U.S. District Court of Northern California, did issue an injunction April 24, telling the Trump administration it couldn’t use executive orders to withhold federal funding from the original 15 cities and counties in the lawsuit.
Orrick updated the injunction June 23 to include later policy memos tying “all new federal awards” to immigration compliance. The Trump administration said it would appeal the injunction.
“It appears that the defendants continue to seek an end run around the preliminary injunction,” Orrick wrote in June. Orrick left the door open for the administration to withhold funds directly tied to illegal immigration, but he said the administration still must make a case that there’s a real connection between immigration and other issues — especially with seemingly unrelated programs like highway and housing funds.
‘ICE out of Baltimore!’: Recent immigration raids prompt Baltimore protest

If the new cities and counties are accepted into the lawsuit, there would be a total of 50 localities in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
The Supreme Court decision in Trump v. CASA, limiting nationwide injunctions, now “creates more impetus in this litigation and in others for more parties to seek relief to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the case for the Public Rights Project. The California-based group promotes civil rights protections for states and cities.
Generally, the local sanctuary policies at stake are those that limit cooperation with “detainers” asking local law enforcement authorities to hold arrested people in jail up to two days after they would otherwise go free, on behalf of federal immigration investigations. Some states and localities limit cooperation with detainers, some require cooperation.
“[Trump officials] are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting local governments to do their bidding and this case is pushback against that,” Miller said. “Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.”
In a March filing, attorneys for the Trump administration defended the planned funding cutoffs as part of the president’s Jan. 20 executive order to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’ which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.”
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, in a response to a reporter’s question that was posted July 8 by the White House, said the administration is more determined than ever to go after cities that don’t fully cooperate.
“We’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because they’re a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is,” Homan said. “We know they’re releasing public safety threats.”
According to June numbers obtained by the TRAC data clearinghouse at Syracuse University, nearly 44% of people held in immigration detention have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses such as traffic violations. The rest were detained based on pending charges or purely immigration-related offenses such as crossing the border in secret.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Dozens of advocates gathered in a webinar Wednesday to try to determine the impact of the possible loss of $125 million in federal aid to Maryland schools this year, part of $6.8 billion in education funding frozen just last week by the Trump administration.
They know this much: The news is not good.
“It’s really difficult times,” said Mary Gable, assistant state superintendent for student support and federal programs with the Maryland Department of Education, toward the end of Wednesday’s hourlong webinar. “We are concerned about finances. We are concerned … at the state level, at the local education level and at the community-based organization level.”
The U.S. Education Department informed school systems on June 30 — one day before the funds were scheduled to become available — that it had frozen the release of $6.8 billion in federal aid as part of its “ongoing programmatic review of education funding.” A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said that no final decisions had been made but that “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
Most of the funding being withheld would have reached low-income students, provided before- and after-school programming or taught English instruction to non-English-speaking students.
Crisaly De Los Santos says those programs were not targeted by accident.
“It’s a direct attack on Black and brown [people] and the immigrant community, not just in Maryland but across the country,” said De Los Santos, CASA’s director for Baltimore and Central Maryland, in an interview Wednesday. “Withholding this funding will directly affect students who need it the most.”




Freeze on federal funds
State officials did not provide a dollar amount for all programs, but said the estimated $125 million Maryland could lose in frozen federal funding would affect these programs:

Title I, Part A (Improving basic programs operated by Local Education Agencies): $26.7 million (8.3%) decrease
Title I, Part C (Migrant education): No funds allocated
Title II, Part A (Teacher and school leader support): No funds allocated
Title III, Part A (English learners): No funds allocated
Title IV, Part A (Student support and academic enrichment): No funds allocated
Title IV, Part B (21st Century before- and after-school): No funds allocated
Title V (Rural education): $2,621 (1.7%) decrease
McKinney-Vento (Homeless education assistance): $251,481 (11.3%) decrease





The money, approved by Congress in March as part of a continuing budget resolution, would have been available for the upcoming school year. Besides support for migrant education and low-income students, the money would have funded support for educators, adult education and literacy programs, among others.
Preliminary estimates in Maryland show the state could lose about $125 million, said Raven Hill, spokesperson for the state Department of Education, in an email sent Tuesday. “These funds represent real dollars and real positions in school systems across our state,” she said.
It remains unclear exactly how Maryland will be affected with summer programs and those in the fall.
Erik Peterson, senior vice president of policy for the Washington, D.C.-based Afterschool Alliance, gave a presentation in Wednesday’s webinar that included information on the 21st Century Community Learning Centers. The National Education Association said Maryland would normally get a little more than $25 million in that program for summer and after-school programs. Peterson said about 100 communities receive those grants to support nearly 24,000 students.
“It’s putting whole organizations at risk,” said Ellie Mitchell, director of the Maryland Out of School Time Network, that works to boost after-school and summer programs statewide, in an interview Wednesday. Mitchell’s organization co-hosted the webinar with Peterson’s group.
Mitchell said 21st Century grant recipients in Maryland are mostly concentrated in Baltimore City, Prince George’s County, the Eastern Shore and some Western Maryland counties.
“The funds are targeted for Title 1 schools and schools that have 40% or more of their students eligible for free and reduced meals,” Mitchell said. “It’s going to disproportionately impact the counties and places that have the highest concentration of kids in poverty.”
Both Mitchell and Peterson said advocates need to talk to federal, state and county elected officials about how important the programs are in serving students and their families.
“Continue that drumbeat,” Peterson said.
‘Colleagues enabling it’
Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) office is “deeply concerned” about the potential cuts and will partner with the state Education and Labor departments to assess the potential impact for Maryland, said Moore spokesperson Carter Elliott IV in an email.
“These reductions will translate into real and immediate losses for our schools in every corner of the state,” Elliott said. “These reductions could put teaching jobs, after- and summer-school programs and adult education programs at risk, hurting teachers, students, and families across the state.”

Maryland’s overwhelmingly Democratic congressional delegation routinely criticizes the Trump administration, and their response to the frozen school funding was no different.
“This Administration is obsessed with making lives worse for kids and families,” Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “My reaction is one of deep frustration at this Administration’s decision to turn its back on the next generation and at my colleagues for enabling it.”
In the meantime, educators such as Katie Cole continue to wait and see how much money will be released and how it will affect Dorchester County schools, where he works, and the system’s nearly 4,600 students.
Cole said federal funds have paid for fifth-grade students (estimated at $150 each) to spend a week in NorthBay  in Cecil County. The trip is built into the science curriculum, allows students to learn “team building” activities while learning about nature and the environment. It also helps prepare them for science literacy when taking the Maryland Integrated Science Assessments exam.
Cole, an elementary school teacher and president of Dorchester Educators, said the school system receives federal money for other programs and initiatives, including student conflict resolution with the nonprofit Mid Shore Mediation, the Junior Achievement Academy in Salisbury and a teacher academy partnership with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
“Programs like these really help students,” Cole said. “Everyone is in this kind of limbo with these federal cuts.”

Hydrilla, a highly invasive aquatic plant, poses severe ecological, recreational, and economic risks. If left unmanaged, hydrilla can quickly overwhelm waterways, dramatically impacting native aquatic species, disrupting boating and fishing activities, and potentially causing significant long-term harm to our local ecosystems. 
We acknowledge and respect the concerns expressed by members of the community regarding the use of herbicides such as diquat. Public dialogue and the sharing of diverse perspectives are crucial components of any environmental decision-making process. However, the selective and carefully monitored use of EPA-approved aquatic herbicides, like diquat, currently represents one of the most effective and timely methods available to manage and mitigate the spread of hydrilla.
The Connecticut River Hydrilla Control Research and Demonstration Project integrates an approach that combines herbicide treatments with rigorous monitoring and public transparency, ensuring that environmental and human health are prioritized. Their practices are informed by scientific research, expert consultation, and adherence to strict regulatory standards aimed at minimizing any potential adverse impacts.
We encourage stakeholders concerned about this issue to actively engage by volunteering for surveillance programs, such as boat inspections and invasive weed monitoring, along Connecticut’s shorelines. It is vital that all boaters clean, drain, and dry their watercraft and equipment before entering the water again. Never dump aquarium pets, plants, live baits, and other organisms into natural waterways. 
These efforts will stop the spread of invasive aquatic species. Ongoing, transparent communication and education will help address community concerns, reinforce trust, and facilitate informed discussion. Collaboration and mutual respect will remain key as we collectively strive to protect the Connecticut River for current and future generations.

Asthma rates are sky high.
Hartford, the capital of one of the richest states in the U.S., is one of our nation’s poorest cities. This low-income environmental justice community, with a population that is 85% minority, is burdened with several polluting facilities and heavy traffic, leading to extremely poor air quality. This inequity has real consequences, including daily public health impacts. A child cannot learn while hungry, and cannot thrive while struggling to breathe. We owe these children a fair chance at success in life.

Susan Eastwood
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) “Environmental Justice Affecting Facilities” map shows polluting facilities overlaid on the distressed municipalities in our state. This reveals the historic discrimination and cumulative impacts shockingly well. The high asthma rates are one clear indication of the health consequences of long-term exposure to air pollution in Hartford.
Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven – three cities with large populations of minority, low income residents – have historically been burdened with most of the polluting facilities in Connecticut including power plants, waste incinerators, and others. Add to that the increased pollution from congested highway traffic and the resulting air is full of dangerous particulates and chemicals. Nitrous oxide, CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases nudge the meter on our warming planet ever higher. This impacts us all. All eight Connecticut counties have scored poor grades for air quality and ozone levels from the American Lung Association (ALA).
Our leaders have promised to reduce these pollutants for everyone’s sake, especially those living in the most polluted areas. They pass laws with laudable goals, but our state is falling behind the rest of New England in meeting these targets.
In Executive Order 21-3, Gov. Ned Lamont set strong goals for greenhouse gas reductions and committed the state to “lead by example” by requiring that new state buildings, or those being renovated, use clean and efficient energy saving improvements to have our state act as a model for private building owners. This order has now been codified in law, with the passage of H.B. 5004, now Public Act No. 25-125, signed by the governor on July 1.
The Capitol Area System (CAS) is set next to I-84 in downtown Hartford. The power plant, once a major source of air pollution, now heats and cools a group of 16 buildings in the Frog Hollow area. Most of the buildings are state-owned, including the Legislative Office Building and the State Office Building. CAS was purchased by the state of Connecticut in 2022, with the goal of refurbishing the aging facility to make it an energy efficient source of heating and cooling. The need is even more urgent due to the history of inequity and polluting infrastructure in Hartford.
Today, the state has before it a choice between clean, renewable energy options, or reverting to methane facilities, which would lock the CAS into dirty fuel for decades to come.
A geothermal network would be a great fit for this group of buildings. Using the natural ground temperature, a renewable energy source, instead of fossil fuels like oil or methane, will save money and lives. The savings on medical costs alone is priceless.
What better place to “lead by example” than by modelling what the transition to clean energy looks like, and showing our commitment to a cleaner, more equitable state, while improving the health of Hartford’s children (and everyone else)?
Most recently our state legislature has sped up the timeline for greenhouse gas emission reduction and added targets to help us get there. They have allocated more help to distressed cities and towns that are overburdened. The governor has already made a strong commitment in Executive Order 21-3, which is now codified in P.A. No. 25-125. There is no better time than now for him to show that he is willing to follow through on his commitment to the children of Hartford.
The Capitol Area System can play an important role in our state’s transition to a clean and renewable energy future and serve as a model for other aging energy facilities. I urge our governor and the Department of Administrative Services to reconsider their tentative decision to use methane boilers and instead, to truly lead by renovating the Capitol Area System with clean and renewable geothermal.

The legislative package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025, has several provisions that will shrink the safety net, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, long known as food stamps. SNAP spending will decline by an estimated US$186 billion through 2034 as a result of several changes Congress made to the program that today helps roughly 42 million people buy groceries – an almost 20% reduction.
In my research on the history of food stamps, I’ve found that the program was meant to be widely available to most low-income people. The SNAP changes break that tradition in two ways.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 3 million people are likely to be dropped from the program and lose their benefits. This decline will occur in part because more people will face time limits if they don’t meet work requirements. Even those who meet the requirements may lose benefits because of difficulty submitting the necessary documents.
And because states will soon have to take on more of the costs of the program, which totaled over $100 billion in 2024, they may eventually further restrict who gets help due to their own budgetary constraints.
Summing up SNAP’s origins
Inspired by the plight of unemployed coal miners whom John F. Kennedy met in Appalachia when he campaigned for the presidency in 1960, the early food stamps program was not limited to single parents with children, older people and people with disabilities, like many other safety net programs were at the time. It was supposed to help low-income people afford more and better food, regardless of their circumstances.
In response to national attention in the late 1960s to widespread hunger and malnutrition in other areas of the country, such as among tenant farmers in the rural South, a limited food stamps program was expanded. It reached every part of the country by 1974.
From the start, the states administered the program and covered some of its administrative costs and the federal government paid for the benefits in full. This arrangement encouraged states to enroll everyone who needed help without fearing the budgetary consequences.
Who could qualify and how much help they could get were set by uniform national standards, so that even the residents of the poorest states would be able to afford a budget-conscious but nutritionally adequate diet.
The federal government’s responsibility for the cost of benefits also allowed spending to automatically grow during economic downturns, when more people need assistance. These federal dollars helped families, retailers and local economies weather tough times.
The changes to the SNAP program included in the legislative package that Congress approved by narrow margins and Trump signed into law, however, will make it harder for the program to serve its original goals.
Restricting benefits
Since the early 1970s, most so-called able-bodied adults who were not caring for a child or an adult with disabilities had to meet a work requirement to get food stamps. Welfare reform legislation in 1996 made that requirement stricter for such adults between the ages of 18 and 50 by imposing a three-month time limit if they didn’t log 20 hours or more of employment or another approved activity, such as verified volunteering.
Budget legislation passed in 2023 expanded this rule to adults up to age 54. The 2025 law will further expand the time limit to adults up to age 64 and parents of children age 14 or over.
States can currently get permission from the federal government to waive work requirements in areas with insufficient jobs or unemployment above the national average. This flexibility to waive work requirements will now be significantly limited and available only where at least 1 in 10 workers are unemployed.
Concerned senators secured an exemption from the work requirements for most Native Americans and Native Alaskans, who are more likely to live in areas with limited job opportunities.
A 2023 budget deal exempted veterans, the homeless and young adults exiting the foster care system from work requirements because they can experience special challenges getting jobs. The 2025 law does not exempt them.
The new changes to SNAP policies will also deny benefits to many immigrants with authorization to be in the U.S., such as people granted political asylum or official refugee status. Immigrants without authorization to reside in the U.S. will continue to be ineligible for SNAP benefits.

Tracking ‘error rates’
Critics of food stamps have long argued that states lack incentives to carefully administer the program because the federal government is on the hook for the cost of benefits.
In the 1970s, as the number of Americans on the food stamp rolls soared, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, developed a system for assessing if states were accurately determining whether applicants were eligible for benefits and how much they could get.
A state’s “payment error rate” estimates the share of benefits paid out that were more or less than an applicant was actually eligible for. The error rate was not then and is not today a measure of fraud. Typically, it just indicates the share of families who get a higher – or lower – amount of benefits than they are eligible for because of mistakes or confusion on the part of the applicant or the case worker who handles the application.
Congress tried to penalize states with error rates over 5% in the 1980s but ultimately suspended the effort under state pressure. After years of political wrangling, the USDA started to consistently enforce financial penalties on states with high error rates in the mid-1990s.
States responded by increasing their red tape. For example, they asked applicants to submit more documentation and made them go through more bureaucratic hoops, like having more frequent in-person interviews, to get – and continue receiving – SNAP benefits.
These demands hit low-wage workers hardest because their applications were more prone to mistakes. Low-income workers often don’t have consistent work hours and their pay can vary from week to week and month to month. The number of families getting benefits fell steeply.
The USDA tried to reverse this decline by offering states options to simplify the process for applying for and continuing to get SNAP benefits over the course of the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Enrollment grew steadily.

Penalizing high rates
Since 2008, states with error rates over 6% have had to develop a detailed plan to lower them.
Despite this requirement, the national average error rate jumped from 7.4% before the pandemic, to a record high of 11.7% in 2023. Rates rose as states struggled with a surge of people applying for benefits, a shortage of staff in state welfare agencies and procedural changes.
Republican leaders in Congress have responded to that increase by calling for more accountability.
Making states pay more
The big legislative package will increase states’ expenses in two ways.
It will reduce the federal government’s responsibility for half of the cost of administering the program to 25% beginning in the 2027 fiscal year.
And some states will have to pay a share of benefit costs for the first time in the program’s history, depending on their payment error rates. Beginning in the 2028 fiscal year, states with an error rate between 6-8% would be responsible for 5% of the cost of benefits. Those with an error rate between 8-10% would have to pay 10%, and states with an error rate over 10% would have to pay 15%. The federal government would continue to pay all benefits in states with error rates below 6%.
Republicans argue the changes will give states more “skin in the game” and ensure better administration of the program.
While the national payment error rate fell from 11.68% in the 2023 fiscal year to 10.93% a year later, 42 states still had rates in excess of 6% in 2024. Twenty states plus the District of Columbia had rates of 10% or higher.
At nearly 25%, Alaska has the highest payment error rate in the country. But Alaska won’t be in trouble right away. To ease passage in the Senate, where the vote of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, was in doubt, a provision was added to the bill allowing several states with the highest error rates to avoid cost sharing for up to two years after it begins.
Democrats argue this may encourage states to actually increase their error rates in the short term.

The effect of the new law on the amount of help an eligible household gets is expected to be limited.
About 600,000 individuals and families will lose an average of $100 a month in benefits because of a change in the way utility costs are treated. The law also prevents future administrations from increasing benefits beyond the cost of living, as the Biden Administration did.
States cannot cut benefits below the national standards set in federal law.
But the shift of costs to financially strapped states will force them to make tough choices. They will either have to cut back spending on other programs, increase taxes, discourage people from getting SNAP benefits or drop the program altogether.
The changes will, in the end, make it even harder for Americans who can’t afford the bare necessities to get enough nutritious food to feed their families.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Alaskans can request that their DNA and personal genetic information be deleted immediately by bankrupt genetic testing company 23andMe, under the terms of a recent legal settlement. 
State Attorney General Treg Taylor announced the option in a news release on the settlement on June 30.
“I know there are a lot of people out there who don’t realize that the samples and data they gave to 23andMe could soon be controlled by a different entity,” Taylor said. “If you know somebody who took a 23andMe test, I encourage you to make sure they are aware of their right to have this sensitive information deleted.”
The company’s dissolution and sale is the largest bankruptcy case to handle millions of people’s DNA and genetic information as a corporate asset. A federal bankruptcy judge in Missouri approved the sale and settlement agreement on June 27 with TTAM Research Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization that will take over 23andMe’s assets, including customer data. The organization is led by former co-founder of 23andMe, Anne Wojcicki, and acquired the company for $305 million. That transfer process began on July 7.
Alaska joined 30 states and the District of Columbia in objecting to the proposed sale of the company due to privacy concerns and what would happen to consumer data, said Ian Engelbeck, an assistant district attorney in the consumer protection unit of the Alaska Department of Law, in a phone interview Wednesday. 
“Genetic data reflects more than just your own genes, right? It reflects your children’s genes, your parents’ genes, your relatives’ genes. It’s unique to you,” Engelbeck said, and there’s no way to recover it if it is exposed. “So the sensitivity of the information involved was what first attracted the attention of Alaska and of the other states that got involved in this matter.” 
Engelbeck said Alaska withdrew its objections to the sale in return for additional consumer protections. “We were able to limit the amount of Alaskan data that would automatically be transferred from 23andMe to TTAM,” he said. “And we’re happy that we’re able to do that, but folks who are concerned about it should know that they can still request that their data be deleted.”
The company 23andMe began as a startup in 2007, and provided DNA testing services to customers for personalized information on ancestry and health. The service grew in popularity, with millions of customers connecting to long-lost relatives, cultural heritage, and even — in some cases of adopted children — finding biological siblings and parents. In addition, 80% of customers opted to have their data used in research, and were also part of the company’s scientific partnerships studying a range of research topics, including genetic bases of diseases from Parkinson’s disease, to diabetes and psychological conditions. 
The company went public in 2021 valued at $6 billion, but struggled to grow with mostly one-time customers. 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in federal court in March, triggering a complex court case that considered highly sensitive personal information such as DNA for 23andMe’s approximately 15 million customers. 
Under the settlement, only Alaskans who opted in to additional research consent agreements, having their de-identified test results shared with third parties or having their DNA samples “biobanked” — allowing the company to store and access samples beyond 10 years — and will have their information transferred to TTAM. Or they can request 23andMe delete their data and destroy their DNA samples through their 23andMe account. 
Alaskans who did not consent, or opt in, will not have their information transferred. 
For Alaskans who did not give additional consents, they can request their data be deleted immediately, or their data will be automatically deleted in 12 months.
In 2023, there was a massive data breach of 23andMe, resulting in an estimated 7 million customers’ data affected. Alaskans that believe they have a claim against 23andMe related to the data breach can file a claim by July 14. 
An estimated 1.9 million customers have already deleted their accounts, according to court filings. 
For those that remain opted in, their data will be transferred to TTAM. “My understanding is that TTAM intends to operate as a research nonprofit,” Engelbeck said. 
“I don’t think we have, you know, perfect transparency into what exactly its plans are yet,” he added. 
TTAM has agreed to a series of privacy provisions for customer information they are taking over, according to court filings, including allowing 23andMe customers to request their data, samples or accounts be deleted anytime.
Engelbeck added, as a matter of privacy, that Alaskans can check with their relatives as well, about whether to request deleting information. 
“If your grandmother took a 23andMe (test) or your mom, you know, if your relatives took a 23andme test, and this is maybe not top of mind for them, it might be good to check in with them too,” he said. “Because you know this DNA data reflects not just yourself, not just the person who took the test, but also your relatives.”

Too often, students from under-resourced communities are told to dream big but aren’t given the tools to make those dreams real.

So will Yari, telling me that she is going to pursue entrepreneurship and applied to a more rigorous high school after visiting Pillar VC.   
If you spend any time with middle schoolers, you know that this is what impact looks like in action.  
Students deeply engage and are deeply affected when the task at hand is relevant, and they can see the connection to their futures. As a former teacher, school leader and now leader of a school network, I believe it is imperative that we prepare students for both college and career by pairing academic rigor with what the real world demands: durable skills and career-connected learning. 
This work isn’t theoretical. UP Academy Dorchester and UP Academy Holland— preK-8 and preK-6 public schools serving students furthest from opportunity—deliver immersive, career-connected learning without sacrificing academic expectations. Our “Path and Potential” work deepens student engagement and strengthens skills like collaboration, critical thinking, and resilience—skills that matter in any high school, college, or career setting.  Durable skills include communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and self-direction. These are the skills that allow students to apply what they know—and they’re exactly what today’s employers are asking for. According to a recent analysis, 66 percent of job postings in Massachusetts called for at least one durable skill, often at rates far higher than technical or hard skills. 
Although Massachusetts does acknowledge and lay out ways all students can engage in work-based learning and requires work-based learning for Career Technical Education programs, it does not have a complete framework or clear expectations for work-based learning outcomes for all our schools.  
Equipping students with these durable skills and exposing them to career opportunities should start early. Giving kids in elementary grades a taste of what professional opportunities are open to them can spark their interest in pursuing these careers. It’s a simple way to match students’ interests with pathways to success that are available to them – much like schools that name classrooms after colleges and hang college banners on their doors tell children that a college education is attainable. 
These skills need to be embedded across a school’s curriculum, and extended through experiential learning. Whether students are designing a peace garden alongside professionals at Suffolk Construction, working with mentors from Bitsight to understand cybersecurity careers, or exploring how AI can be used to help their community with the team at Dell, they are seeing themselves in futures that would not have been visible to them if not for these experiences.  While the prevailing belief seems to be that developing partnerships between schools and the private sector is a major barrier, we haven’t found that to be the case. In the past year alone, 285 UP Academy students—from 5th through 8th grade—participated in immersive experiences with 18 local companies. Each homeroom was matched to a STEM-related partner, allowing students to explore professional environments, meet adults doing inspiring work, and begin building the social capital that fuels future success.

The structured “Imagine Your Future” experiences and mentorship programs offered are not one-offs. They are thoughtfully designed, embedded in the calendar, and aligned to academic and social-emotional goals. These aren’t field trips—they’re foundational. Our partners in this work have been willing to thoughtfully co-design experiences that are developmentally appropriate, highly engaging, and, of course, fun.  Too often, students from under-resourced communities are told to dream big but aren’t given the tools to make those dreams real. Equity means ensuring every student builds the academic skills and the durable skills needed to succeed. It means giving them sight lines into real-world careers and instilling the confidence to pursue them. 
We don’t have to choose between high expectations and real-world relevance. As the Commonwealth reexamines its graduation requirements and considers the future of assessments like MCAS, we have an opportunity to broaden the definition of success. Academic achievement should remain a cornerstone. But if we want to prepare students for their future—not ours—we must elevate durable skills and career-connected learning as co-equal pillars of rigorous education.

Rosa DeLauro in primary,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/rosa-delauro-primary-damjan-denoble/,"Damjan DeNoble, a 40-year-old lawyer, cited the need for generational change as a motive for seeking a primary against U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro.","Damjan DeNoble, a 40-year-old attorney who works in New Haven, is running against longtime U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro in the 2026 Democratic primary, citing the need for generational change at a time when the party writ large is grappling with such a question.
DeNoble, a first-time candidate who’s a naturalized citizen from former Yugoslavia, filed paperwork Tuesday to run in the 3rd Congressional District and will formally launch his campaign next week with a video and website. DeLauro, who has a leadership spot on a top committee, plans to seek a 19th term in the U.S. House. 
DeNoble founded the firm Frontera Labor, which focuses on employment-based immigration like H-2B visas to help businesses with seasonal and temporary work as well as with household employers. DeNoble’s firm was working more on immigration cases during the first Trump administration but chose to pivot after the election, given the expected challenges to the immigration landscape. 
He lives in Guilford with his wife and three children.
Given that Connecticut’s 3rd Congressional District is considered a safe seat for Democrats, the primary is seen as the only real opportunity to wage a campaign.
DeLauro, 82, has represented the district for more than three decades and has long roots in New Haven; her parents served in local politics. During her tenure, she rose through the ranks to serve as the chairwoman of the influential House Appropriations Committee when Democrats were in the majority. With Republicans at the helm, she is now the ranking member.
DeNoble didn’t have criticisms of DeLauro specifically but voiced frustrations about the Democratic Party, its response to younger talent and the party’s brand in the wake of the 2024 election.
“While Rosa DeLauro has done a great job for us, I think it’s time to pass the torch,” DeNoble said in an interview, saying that he is seeking generational change. “The Democratic Party has proven itself to be very bad at at that.”
“We’re not going to kowtow to the party,” he said. “I don’t think the party has much left to offer.”
Before entering politics herself, DeLauro served as former Sen. Chris Dodd’s chief of staff and campaign manager. She also served as the executive director for EMILY’s List, a political action committee that helps women who support abortion rights get elected. She first came to Congress in 1991 after a tight race but has been easily reelected ever since.
If DeLauro wins another term and Democrats take back control of the House in 2026, she could reclaim the gavel and serve again as Appropriations Committee chairwoman. In her leadership roles, she helps craft and negotiate spending bills that fund the federal government.
“Rosa intends to run for reelection and welcomes anyone that wants to run for the seat,” DeLauro’s campaign manager Chris Carroll said in response to DeNoble’s run.
For DeNoble, he sees room for changes with a “whole bunch of things that need to be done to bring our democratic system in balance and lower the temperature” in politics. He said he doesn’t believe an octogenarian lawmaker is the best-positioned to accomplish that.
DeNoble is part of a growing number of candidates who are looking to take on sitting members in Connecticut in 2026. Four of the five members of the state’s congressional delegation now have at least one primary challenger. Some of those incumbents didn’t have primary challengers in their last campaigns, including DeLauro.
Ruth Fortune, a 37-year-old mayoral appointee on the Hartford Board of Education, filed last week to run against U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, in the primary. And U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, also recently gained primary challengers in their races.
Debate over politicians’ age and length of service hit a fever pitch during the 2024 election with former President Joe Biden, who ultimately abandoned his efforts to seek a second term. Those discussions are ongoing as Democrats consider their party’s future.
DeNoble said he wants to see a system that isn’t based as much on seniority. Typically, openings for committee leadership go to the most senior members on that panel.
He cited some frustration that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York lost an internal vote to become the leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee to a more senior member, U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Maryland. Connolly ultimately stepped down when his cancer worsened, and after his death, the role was filled by a younger congressman over a more seasoned member.
He called the campaign of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist who defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the primary for New York City mayor, “super fascinating.” But that sentiment mostly extended to his campaign’s strategy around video and social media, something DeNoble believes he can replicate in his own race.
“Our campaign strength is going to be media,” DeNoble said.
Aside from generational change, DeNoble’s reasons for running are personal. He said he worries what the future will look like for his young children, including concerns over college affordability. “That’s what really moved me,” he said.
For her part, DeLauro recently reflected on her lengthy career in Congress and the future. During her interview as part of the Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series, DeLauro was asked about the frustration among some Americans that members of Congress are serving in office for too long.
DeLauro views her long tenure and influence as a benefit — and something that doesn’t happen overnight. She believes relationships are at the heart of her job and argued that it took time to earn trust from Republicans and Democrats. She said that mutual respect was particularly helpful when it came to work on the federal child tax credit.
“I believe this, and it might sound very self-serving, but I do have the trust of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. They’ll know that I’m not trying to take them down a wrong road, or hurt them in some way, that I’m doing something that I think can be beneficial overall,” DeLauro said at the June event.
“That doesn’t happen in one year, two years, even five years. It happens over a period of time to get to know you and what you are about that,” DeLauro said. “That’s not to say that the time comes when you should say, ‘I’ve had a good run.'”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Damjan-Denoble_CT-03_New-Generation_202544-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 22:08:40.378242

Josh Shapiro signed House Bill 1431 into law, repealing Pennsylvania’s ban on Sunday hunting on July 9, 2025 in Dauphin County. (John Cole/Capital-Star)Flanked by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and outdoor enthusiasts at Blue Ridge Sportsman Club in Dauphin County, Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a new law repealing Pennsylvania’s longtime ban on Sunday hunting.
“It lifts the outdated ban on Sunday hunting and instead gives the Game Commission the freedom to set hunting seasons that makes sense for today’s sportsmen,” Shapiro said on Wednesday. “It is a smart change that puts the decision making about Pennsylvania’s hunting seasons squarely in the hands of the experts of the Game Commission and those who know our game populations best.”
House Bill 1431 was authored by state Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny). She led the effort in the House, while state Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie) introduced identical legislation in the Senate and helped get the bill through the legislature.
The measure passed both chambers with bipartisan support.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prior to 2019, hunting on Sundays had mostly been illegal under the state’s Blue Laws, stemming from the Quaker roots of the commonwealth that barred certain activities on the sabbath. Hunting crows, foxes and coyotes has been legal on Sundays prior to 2019.
Pennsylvania joins 39 other states with no limitations on hunting on Sundays and allows hunters to take deer, bear, turkey or other game, as long as it’s on an in-season Sunday.
Gov. Tom Wolf signed a law in 2019 to allow hunting on three Sundays each year: one during archery season, one during rifle season, and one Sunday selected by the Game Commission.
Shapiro noted during the signing of the new law on Wednesday that he’s not a hunter. However, he said he believes those who don’t participate in hunting should support the law.
“It’s great for Pennsylvania’s economy,” Shapiro said. “Our rural communities are now going to attract more hunters from other parts of the commonwealth and out-of-state hunters who can now, not just show up for a day, but devote a full weekend to hunting here in Pennsylvania.”

According to the governor’s office, hunting contributes over $1.6 billion annually to Pennsylvania’s economy, while supporting more than 15,000 jobs and generating millions in state and local tax revenue.
Pennsylvania has 850,000 licensed hunters, which is the second most in the nation behind only Texas. The sale of hunting licenses generated more than $59 million in revenue for the Game Commission last year.
State Game Commission (PGC) Executive Director Steve Smith said repealing the ban is a huge step towards making hunting more accessible for younger people and those who work on weekdays.
As Rep. Steele promoted the bill throughout the legislative process, she described not being able to hunt on Sundays as a “major hurdle” for busy families and working people. And she told personal anecdotes of how, through hunting with her children, they gained a connection with the land around them.
Shapiro also referenced hunting as a way to have younger people spend more time outdoors in the state.
“Opening up more Sundays for hunting creates more opportunities for families to get kids away from the iPhones and instead outside in the wilderness, in the woods, to help them build the skills and experience they need to be lifelong hunters as well,” Shapiro said.
While Steele’s bill was backed by groups like the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists, Hunter Nation, and Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, it also had support from agriculture organizations, like the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau.
The organizations’ leaders have said they believe expanding hunting on Sundays can help reduce crop damage by better managing deer population.
State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding also celebrated that aspect of the law on Wednesday. He said today was a story of “more and less.”
“More days to hunt, more opportunities to bag a deer, more hunters, more effective deer management, more relief from crop damage, more food on the table and in the food bank,” Redding said. “And it’s less crop damage, less habitat destruction, and less hunger.”
Redding and others also said the new law strengthens protections against trespassing on private property.
“We’re about to grow our economy, protect our wildlife and the rights of landowners, and at the same time, creating more real freedom here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said. “This is a major win for Pennsylvania and it is long overdue.”

Some outdoors and environmental organizations concerns remain
While Wednesday was a celebration for some hunting, agriculture, and outdoor organizations, multiple groups who opposed the bill throughout the legislative process said their stance hasn’t changed.
“Our members remain rightfully concerned that this bill will keep non-hunters out of the woods. Hikers, birders, and others might choose to stay home because they have concerns about safety,” Jen Quinn, legislative and political director for the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club, told the Capital-Star. “Additionally, we are doubtful that expanding hunting to Sundays will effectively manage the deer herd or reduce their numbers enough to have positive benefits to the agricultural community or our forest ecosystems.”
Keystone Trails Association Executive Director Brook Lenker, noted a lot of hiking occurs on the weekends.
“We remain concerned that more Sundays open to hunting diminishes the quality of the hiking experience on those days and pose increased safety risks to hikers and other trail users,” Lenker told the Capital-Star.
Jenny Reimenschneider, a 64-year old who lives in Eagleville, Montgomery County, said she doesn’t believe the legislation addresses concerns about trespassing, will not properly manage the deer herd, and doesn’t take into consideration the impact on the majority of the state who are not hunters.
“They’re getting more and more leeway, and they are not the majority of the population by any means,” Reimenschneider told the Capital-Star. “And to me, that’s discriminatory against the rest of the population, like me and millions of other people that want to go and just enjoy a hike in the places that we all pay for.”

When does the law take effect? And which Sundays will be open? 
The law takes effect on September 7, which is 60 days after the legislation is signed into law. Smith noted that is “right on the brink” of hunting seasons.
However, it remains unclear which Sundays the Game Commission will add for hunting.
“That gives us a little bit of time, not a lot, but a little bit of time, to figure out a path forward,” Smith said. “So, internally, we are reviewing it to see what our options are.”
He noted that they are working with their Board of Commissioners, legal counsel, biologists, and law enforcement to make that decision. The governor’s office said the results will be guided by biological data and hunter feedback.
“All I can tell them, as of today, is to stay tuned and buy your hunting license,” Smith said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/E40DC8FB-EC20-453E-A740-371A871C760A_1_105_c-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 21:08:37.820146

(Courtesy of ICE)OMAHA — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested a man Wednesday from El Salvador that ICE described as one of that country’s most wanted criminals and said they had found him hiding in Nebraska’s largest city.
ICE did not identify the man, telling reporters the investigation was not yet complete. But in a Wednesday press release it described him as an “MS-13 kingpin” and said he was wanted for murder.
Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in a statement posted on social media outlet X, thanked federal and local law enforcement agencies for working “around the clock to keep our Nebraska communities safe.”
The ICE release described the arrested leader as wanted in connection with the homicides of five people, an attempt on at least one more and affiliation with an gang it alleged engaged in terrorism.
Federal law enforcement officials announced that he was arrested with another member of the MS-13 gang also in the country without documentation. They identified him as Rene Saul Escobar Ochoa, 30.
ICE, in the release, said he is accused of having given orders to fellow gang members “to commit a variety of crimes, including multiple homicides, extortion, imprisonment and drug trafficking.”
Both men were arrested “without incident” in a joint law enforcement operation that included ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
It said the men had lived in Omaha.
“They thought they could hide in America’s heartland, but they were sadly mistaken,” said HSI Kansas City Special Agent in Charge Mark Zito, whose office oversees Omaha. “Not on our watch.”

This story by Emmie Foster was first published in the Valley News on July 7.
NORWICH — John Sheldon, 11, of Norwich, has been birding for nearly half his life. It’s a fun hobby that gets him outside, he said, often into the woods around his home.
His favorite bird is the northern cardinal because it’s beautiful and “symbolizes hope and joy.”
On a Saturday last month, he was among a group of children, ranging in age from 9 to 12, who braved the rain for the second meeting of the Upper Valley Youth Birding Club.
Fourteen had registered for the outing, but only a hardy quintet showed up on one of the many rainy Saturdays in recent weeks.
Outfitted in rain gear and carrying binoculars, the small group was prepared and determined.
While no northern cardinals made an appearance that day, the group spotted several species of songbirds, including flycatchers, swallows and sparrows.

The club is led by Chris Rimmer, director emeritus of the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, which serves as the club’s institutional home.
Rimmer, who has long led birding walks in the Upper Valley, said via email that he “always enjoyed it when parents brought a kid along.”
Those experiences inspired him to consider “a focused effort to get youth involved with birding” — an idea he’s mulled over for more than two years.
Reflecting on the club’s purpose, Rimmer emphasized the importance of connecting youth to conservation: “As a career ornithologist and conservationist, I have always known that the key to a healthy ecological future lies with future generations.”
The club convened at 8 a.m. in a grassy clearing on Campbell Flat Road, two turns off Route 5 in Norwich. The road runs parallel to the Ompompanoosuc River and intersects with Academy Road in Thetford, just south of Union Village Dam.
After a round of introductions, Rimmer explained that the group was likely to encounter many songbirds — most notably the warbling vireo. The bird, he said, can sing up to 22,000 unique songs in a single day and is one of the region’s most abundant migratory songbirds.
Just as the group began walking, Rimmer raised his binoculars toward the treetops, where a male brown-headed cowbird flitted among the uppermost branches.

The species, once native to the midwestern plains, moved eastward as land was cleared for farming.
Once everyone had gotten a good look at its glossy black body and light-brown head, the group continued slowly along the gravel road. Rimmer mentioned the possibility of seeing an American bittern — a well-camouflaged bird that’s notoriously difficult to spot but breeds in New England during the warmer months. Bitterns have been living in Campbell Flats, the open fields and marshland on either side of the road, all spring.
To help the children identify its call, Rimmer used a small portable speaker to play its song.
Enthusiasm undamped
A light rain began to fall within minutes of setting out, but the group’s energy and excitement remained undeterred.
As the group crossed a nearly overflowing brook, a low, throaty chorus surrounded them. What was almost mistaken for bird songs was the call of gray treefrogs, likely nestled in the foliage along the brook.
Upon hearing the frogs, Jim Goetz, of Ithaca, New York — who works remotely for VCE on projects in the Caribbean and joined the group Saturday while passing through the area — remarked that, as a birder, it’s important to recognize all the sounds in the environment, not just the birdsongs.

The rain grew heavier, and the trees gave way to the fields of the Campbell Flats. A red-winged blackbird swooped low over the tall grasses.
The roughly quarter-mile area is a well-known birding site, privately owned by the Sargent family, who maintain public trails. During the warmer months, migratory birds nest in the fields and in bird boxes along the roadside. To avoid disturbing nests in the grasses, the Sargents delay mowing until late summer.
As the rain intensified, Ruby Wible, 9, of Norwich, crouched by the roadside picking small white flowers. Nearby, tiny bubbles — spittlebug homes — clung to the tall grasses dotting the wet landscape.
Norwich resident, Asher Beck, 9, said his interest in birds began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he spent time with his grandfather reading a birding book. Eventually, they ventured out into Campbell Flats, near his home, to see the birds for themselves. The area is one of his favorite places to go birding.
Jack Batchman, 12, traveled 42 miles from Brookfield for the outing — his second time making the trip to the Upper Valley to join the club. The first meeting was at Killowatt South Park in Wilder. He became interested in birding when he moved from Arvada, Colorado, to Vermont three years ago.
Birding “gets me out in nature,” he said, adding that he is particularly drawn to the “mindfulness of it.”

Jack started birding three years ago, when his family moved to Vermont from Colorado. “I saw a snowy owl fly over my house and I was hooked,” he said. Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News 
Like Rimmer, he hoped to spot an American bittern during the walk, calling them “funny looking” — with long necks that taper into short, stout bodies perched on lanky legs. Despite the absence of American bitterns, his spirits were high as he forged ahead through the rain, keeping near to the front of the group. He said he planned to continue attending the outings.
The group spotted several birds during the outing, including a male yellow-bellied sapsucker, black-capped chickadees, bobolinks, a red-eyed vireo and a warbling vireo. Jim Goetz published the list of sightings on eBird, a website and app operated by Cornell University’s Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
Birders around the world can contribute to a global database by logging their species sightings — data that helps inform conservation decisions and ecological research, according to eBird’s website.
The next meeting of the club is at Windsor Grassland Wildlife Management Area on Saturday at 7:30 a.m. Those who wish to participate can do so by registering via the events page on VCE’s website: https://vtecostudies.org/events/.

But with the start of the new school year only six weeks away, time is running out. 
The funds, which school officials had expected to receive on July 1, were set to be used for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States learned the funds would be withheld with just one day of notice, leaving districts scrambling to fund programs they were already committed to offering and pay staff whom they had already hired. 
Gov. Jared Polis led a roundtable on Wednesday with superintendents, teachers and education nonprofit leaders at West High School in Denver, where he blasted the withholding of funds as “harmful and opaque.”
“These are very difficult decisions that districts now have to make, and it has to happen in the next couple of weeks,” Polis said.

The federal Department of Education has not provided a timeline on the funds, which in a notice to states it said are under review. The funds total $6.8 billion nationwide and were already approved by Congress. Colorado’s share of that withheld money was originally estimated at $70 million, but Polis said an updated estimate is $80 million. 
If the federal funds are not restored, Jefferson County Public Schools will lose out on $3.3 million it had already allocated. That would result in cuts to staff and programs meant for coaching new teachers, supporting English language learners, lowering truancy rates and conducting family outreach.
One of the district’s services that would need to be scaled back is a program that sends staff across Jefferson County in a refurbished bus to meet with parents, hand out resource flyers and sign up kids who are recent immigrants for support services.
“We’re very worried about how to run our programs without that funding,” said Tracy Dorland, Jefferson County Public Schools superintendent. “This has an impact not only on our students, which is the most important impact, but also on our workforce.”
With potential layoffs looming, Melissa Gibson, the executive director of the Colorado Association of School Executives, said superintendents and principals are having to make tough choices in the coming weeks. 
“Every district leader is approaching this with students at the center and trying to mitigate the damage as much as possible,” Gibson said. “Every school community invests in them in different ways, but this is challenging.”
Both of Colorado’s U.S. senators, along with the state’s four Democrats in the House, sent a joint letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon “demanding answers on the stalled education funds,” according to a Tuesday announcement.
“School districts throughout Colorado are depending on these funds to deliver critical services to students across the state,” the letter said. “The delay and uncertainty around the distribution of this funding have made it incredibly difficult for school districts to plan and hire staff for the next school year.”
During the roundtable, Polis declined to specify if Colorado plans to sue over the withheld funds,  but he said the state is “exploring all available options” to get the funding restored.
“We are being very aggressive, to fight for these funds and for the schools,” Polis said.

John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, toured 4 Noses Brewing Company in Denver in May. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Sen John Hickenlooper is renewing a call to repeal part of a 19th-century law that conservative activists have used to restrict medication abortion access in cities across the country.
“These extreme Republicans and dust-covered laws from 1873 should not be directing a women’s right to make her own health care decisions,” the Colorado Democrat said during a Wednesday virtual panel with Colorado OB-GYNs and reproductive health leaders.
Hickenlooper is a sponsor of the Stop Comstock Act, which would repeal the Comstock Act of 1873, a measure that outlaws the mailing of “lewd” and “indecent” material. Anti-abortion activists have sought enforcement of the dormant law to essentially enact bans on many abortions, including medication abortions where patients receive mifepristone and other drugs in the mail after consulting with a doctor. Mifepristone is also used in many miscarriage treatments.

The federal tax break and spending cut bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week cuts Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood — though that provision was temporarily blocked by a judge — and advocates worry that it could add strain to an already under-attack reproductive health system.
“We know that many of those people (on Medicaid) will not be able to seek care and other institutions or other avenues, and we know that places that are able to continue providing sexual health care are going to face increased demand and increased weight,” said Dr. Rebecca Cohen, a Colorado OB-GYN.
Pueblo City Council has voted twice since 2022 to oppose a proposed city ordinance that would have used the Comstock Act to restrict abortion access in the city. In October 2024, the council voted 4-3 to kill the ordinance before it moved to a final vote. If it had passed in Pueblo, it almost certainly would have been struck down due to Colorado’s Reproductive Health Equity Act.
“Abortion opponents have seized on the idea that the Comstock Act could be misused to ban the mailing of mifepristone and other drugs used in medication abortions,” Cobalt President Karen Middleton said.
Backers of the so-called “Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn” project have helped over 20 local governments, mostly in Texas, pass ordinances to ban abortion by enforcing the federal law, most recently Big Sandy in Texas with a population of about 1,300.
Hickenlooper called the legislative effort a “marathon.” Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the U.S. Senate and a 220-212 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“The issue with this circumstance, like every circumstance, is there are a number of reasonable, moderate Republicans that have been pushed to the corner, and they are threatened with primaries with tens of billions of dollars against them if they violate anything that the White House is trying to push,” he said. “At some point, when we have a breakthrough election, this will be the kind of thing — all the debris that is accumulated from the Trump years — we’ll be able to clean it out.”
Melisa Hidalgo-Cuellar, the chair of the Cobalt Abortion Fund, said the organization has seen a nearly 1,200% increase in funding for people accessing care at telehealth-only clinics that mail abortion medication to patients. It can be difficult to travel to a brick-and-mortar clinic for people without reliable transportation, who don’t have child care or who live far from a physical clinic.
“You really see that people are opting for this because it’s a more convenient and affordable option for a lot of abortion seekers,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said.
Hickenlooper’s bill was assigned to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it was introduced.

Eshelman has until July 16 to state why the court should consider the corner-crossing conflict between public access to public land and private property rights.
The post Extension denial leaves Wyoming ranch owner a week to convince SCOTUS to hear corner crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman will have to convince four of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nine justices to take up his appeal of a lower court’s decision that corner crossing is not trespassing.
His attorneys have until July 16 to file their reasons why a ruling by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals merits Supreme Court review. On Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch rejected without comment a request by Eshelman’s attorneys for a second 30-day extension, leaving July 16 as the deadline. Gorsuch granted the initial extension in May. 
“A 30-day extension would allow counsel sufficient time to fully prepare the petition for filing,” Eshelman’s attorney Robert Reeves Anderson wrote in his unsuccessful bid. “Counsel will not seek a further extension.”
The Denver appeals court found in March that four Missouri hunters, Bradly Cape, Phillip Yoemans, Zachary Smith and John Slowensky, did not trespass when they passed through the airspace above Eshelman’s ranch in the checkerboard pattern of land ownership in Carbon County.
A map from court files shows the checkerboard layout of property ownership on Elk Mountain. Tan squares are public BLM land and private land is shaded blue/green. The hunters’ camp is noted, as are section corners in question. (10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another where ownership resembles a checkerboard. Three of the men in 2020 and all four in 2021 crossed a corner abutting Eshelman’s ranch to hunt on Elk Mountain.
They never set foot on Eshelman’s ranch, but he sued them claiming they trespassed by passing through the airspace above his property. The hunters and the appeals court said that an 1885 law granting public access to public land in the checkerboard areas of the West allows corner crossing when private land is not touched or damaged.
Three favorable conditions
Eshelman will file a petition asking the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which, if granted, would open a review of the 10th Circuit decision.  
A writ of certiorari means that the Supreme Court will hear the appeal. (A writ is an order, and certiorari is Latin for “to be fully informed.”) To obtain one, Eshelman must convince four of the nine Supreme Court Justices that the case merits review.
The Supreme Court lays out three conditions in its rules that would favor taking up the case. It will grant a writ “only for compelling reasons,” the rules state.
One reason could be when an appeals court — like the 10th Circuit — issues a decision that conflicts with one of the nation’s other 12 appeals courts.
The justices would favor a case in which a federal appeals decision conflicts with a state supreme court decision. Justices also favor reviews of outlier decisions.
An instance might be when a lower court “has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings,” that the Supreme Court should exercise its “supervisory power.”

(Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
Other acceptable cases could involve different states’ supreme court rulings that conflict with one another and other conflicts between a state’s high court and a federal appeals decision.
After the expected petition is docketed, the hunters will have 30 days to respond and Eshelman can file a short response, according to Dan Schweitzer, who outlined the process in a paper for the National Association of Attorneys General. Within 14 days of the hunters’ response, the file goes to the justices for their review.
The earliest the justices would debate the petition is on Sept. 29, when a “long” or “opening” conference is scheduled.
Eshelman’s attorneys have given a preview of their reasons for a petition in the extension requests. The case, they said, could have major implications for millions of acres of property in the West.
“This case raises exceptionally important issues at the intersection of private property rights and public access that warrant this Court’s review,” they wrote. “Principally, this case addresses the scope of a landowner’s right to exclude—here, whether a private landowner’s lawful trespass action to exclude a corner crosser from his property is preempted implicitly by the federal Unlawful Inclosures Act.”
“This case presents an ideal vehicle to clarify the scope of the Unlawful Inclosures Act and its restrictions, if any, on a landowner’s right to exclude trespassers,” the filings state.

Frank)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is recommending increasing the number of wolves that can be killed by 50% next season, following the department’s latest report showing the wolf population in Montana remains steady despite increased harvest during the 2024 hunting and trapping season. 
The statewide wolf population in 2024 was estimated at 1,091 animals, 12 fewer than the 2023 population estimate and slightly lower than the 10-year average of 1,138 wolves. However, biologists with FWP say they will expect to see a moderate decline in wolf numbers beginning next year following a proposal that would increase limits to 500 wolves next season, up from 334 during 2023-2024. 
“We are committed to following the law to reduce wolf numbers to a sustainable level, which means ensuring Montana has a healthy, state-managed population,” FWP Chief of Conservation Policy Quentin Kujala said in a press release. “We continue to see declines in the estimated number of wolves and wolf packs in Region 3 (southwest Montana), which suggests the current combination of hunting, trapping, and conflict management removals can effectively reduce wolf numbers in some areas at least.”
During the 2024-25 wolf season, which ended on March 15, the take totaled 297 wolves, including 178 by hunters and 119 by trappers. The number was the highest since 2020, when 326 wolves were killed. Harvest numbers in the state track with population density with 130 wolves taken from Region 1 (northwest); 81 from Region 2 (west central); 55 from Region 3; and 20 from Region 4 (central); 4 from Region 5 (south); and 2 from Region 7 (southeast). Five total wolves were also killed from two smaller management units directly north of Yellowstone National Park. 
Currently, Montana’s total wolf limit is 334 animals, divided into region-specific quotas. Under the new regulations FWP is proposing to the Fish and Wildlife Commission at its meeting next month, the statewide limit will increase to 500, without specific regional quotas. 
Hunters and trappers will be able to take 15 wolves on a single hunting and trapping license — 30 in total — as long as five are hunted and five are trapped in Regions 1 or 2. 
The goal, Kujala told the Daily Montanan in an interview, is to better follow legislative directive to decrease wolf population numbers, and to target the areas where wolves are most prevalent in the state. 
“We saw the impetus to be more aggressive in pursuit of wolf management in Regions 1 and 2,” Kujala said. “If you look at the population estimate for 2024, it’s relatively static, especially in those regions. We saw the chance to be more liberal with hunting regulations where we see more wolves.”
In 2021, the Montana Legislature passed a bill requiring FWP to reduce the number of wolves to a “sustainable level,” with a stated goal of preventing a decline in the state’s deer and elk populations and minimizing livestock predation.
During the 2025 Legislature, lawmakers considered a slew of bills aimed at more dramatically reducing the wolf population — by as much as half —  after several years of seemingly no change in population data. 
“The purpose of (the 2021) language was to start reducing wolves,” Rep. Jed Hinkle, R-Belgrade, chairman of the House Fish, Wildlife and Parks committee, said during a floor debate on a bill that would have required unlimited hunting until the wolf population was at 550 animals. “Let it be known legislative intent — we want the commission to set the quotas in the state so that these numbers can start dropping down.”

According to FWP data, Montana’s wolf population peaked in 2011 with an estimated 1,264 individual animals among 189 packs. In the 13 years since, there has been a slight decline in the number of packs in the state — 181 in the 2024 report — occupying roughly 66,000 acres, with a majority concentrated in the western portion of Montana.
Of the numerous bills introduced during the Legislature — which spurred hours upon hours of debate in committee meetings and during floor sessions — only one major bill became law. 
House Bill 259, brought by Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, requires the Fish and Wildlife Commission to apply different management techniques based on the population conditions in each region — with additional emphasis put on those with the highest populations. The bill also clarified that on private lands, hunters may use infrared and thermal imagery scopes outside of daylight hours. 
“We made sure those changes in law are reflected in the department’s proposal,” Kujala told the Daily Montanan, adding that the discussions during the legislative session, even over bills that ultimately died during the process, helped steer the department’s new proposed regulations. “Ideas to reduce the population more definitively — unlimited quotas, year-round seasons, spring seasons — you don’t see those in the proposal, but they were pieces of the conversation.”
With the shift to a statewide quota, as opposed to stricter regional quotas, Kujala said the hope is that hunters and trappers will be able to increase the take in western Montana, without overly decreasing more eastern regions where there are fewer wolves. 
“Wolves have an inherent ability to avoid harvest,” Kujala said. But, “that’s not saying there won’t be further reduction in areas we aren’t specifically targeting.”
Despite the changes to new hunting regulations skewing towards more definitive and aggressive removal of wolves, Kujala said he thinks FWP’s proposal struck a balance with wolf advocates on the other side of the contentious debate over the role of the predators in the state. 
“The regulations stay out of having a spring season — where there was concern over wolf pups and dependent wolf pups,” Kujala said. The regulations also preserve areas just outside Yellowstone National Park from increased hunting — two special districts north of Yellowstone retain a three-wolf quota each — and the proposal keeps in place the Fish and Wildlife Commission’s authority to revisit the regulations each year. 
The proposed change to wolf bag limits, by allowing hunters and trappers to take up to 15 wolves on a single license, is projected to cost the department roughly $43,000 in license revenue annually, according to FWP data. 
The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission will review and make a final decision on the proposed furbearer and wolf trapping and hunting seasons at its Aug. 21 meeting. The commission will set wolf trapping dates and determine where they apply at its October meeting.
 Depredations decrease, again 

According to the 2024 FWP wolf report, the number of livestock depredation complaints due to wolves increased from 2023, but remained the second-lowest in two decades. The U.S. The Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services division confirmed that in 2024, wolves killed 35 cattle, 16 sheep, three foals and eight livestock guardian dogs statewide, with an additional 18 animals considered probable wolf kills.
The report attributes the decrease in depredations since wolves were reintroduced primarily to more aggressive wolf control actions taken in recent years. 
The 25 wolves killed due to livestock control actions was significantly lower than the 23-year average of 63. 
The Montana Livestock Loss Board reimburses livestock producers for losses from predation and, in 2024, paid out $86,974 to 28 livestock owners for wolf activity. Reimbursements from wolf predation was significantly lower than from grizzly bears, at $144,6171, and roughly four times greater than from mountain lion activity.
During the 2023 calendar year, Montana sold 15,813 resident wolf hunting licenses and 2,727 non-resident licenses. Sales of these licenses generated $287,363 for wolf management and monitoring in the state, among the lowest annual revenue since wolf hunting became legal in the state. In 2020, FWP decreased the price of a resident wolf hunting license from $19 to $12, with a $10 wolf hunting license offered with the purchase of a sportsman’s tag. Nonresident tags cost $50, or $20 with a sportsman’s tag. 
A 2022 study by the Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research found that “wolf centric ecotourism” the Yellowstone region brings in more than $82.7 million to local economies. 
This spring the agency adopted its new Gray Wolf Conservation and Management Plan, the first update in 20 years, to guide future wolf management policy and incorporate the changes in statute.
According to the department, the foundations for the management plan include: recognizing wolves as part of Montana’s wildlife heritage; approaching wolf management similar to other wildlife species; managing wolf populations across the state with flexibility; and addressing and resolving conflicts.
One of the biggest shifts in the 2025 plan is a change in a “key counting metric” for a minimum population benchmark, from 15 breeding pairs to 450 total wolves, but the department emphasizes that is not a population target.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/c1db5324-7bad-486b-b315-ba31fa7034b9Original-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 20:13:15.199060
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-09 23:25:04+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Supreme Court upholds most of PURA decision in Aquarion rate case,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/ct-supreme-court-pura-aquarion-rates/,Justices ruled in favor of state regulators' 2023 decision cutting rates for Aquarion customers by an average of $67 a year.,"The Connecticut Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld nearly all of state regulators’ decision two years ago to cut water rates for Aquarion customers by an average of $67 a year.
The unanimous ruling was largely a victory for the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which has repeatedly clashed with the state’s investor-owned utilities, who have taken issue with its efforts to apply tougher scrutiny to the way the companies operate and the costs they are allowed to recoup from customers.
A key moment in that dispute came in 2023, when PURA rejected Aquarion’s request for an annual rate increase of around $61 a year for the average customer. Instead, PURA voted to reduce rates, citing dissatisfaction with how the company justified years’ worth of capital costs, including plant upgrades and water main repairs.
The company appealed that decision, with the case eventually reaching the state Supreme Court. In Wednesday’s majority opinion, Justice Steven Ecker noted that PURA’s review of Aquarion’s case included audits, evidentiary hearings, numerous exhibits and responses, as well as approximately 48,000 pages of written records.
Despite that lengthy record, Ecker said, there was reason to believe regulators’ justification for not allowing the company to recoup about $42 million in costs associated with its projects.
“Aquarion provided PURA with hundreds of pages of spreadsheets, but the data contained in those spreadsheets were limited to generic information like the name, location, date of completion, and cost of the project,” Ecker wrote. “It was not unreasonable for PURA to decide that this data failed to explain adequately why these itemized plant additions were performed or how they benefited rate-payers.”
The court did side with Aquarion on a smaller dispute over $1.5 million in deferred water conservation costs, remanding that matter back to PURA. 
Jamie Ratliff, a spokeswoman for Aquarion’s parent company, Eversource, said in a statement that the company was encouraged by the court’s “constructive decision.”
“This decision affirms that the costs that utilities incur to serve customers are necessary and shall be recovered through customer rates,” Ratliff said. “We are appreciative of the court’s deliberations and for establishing the rules of the road that must be followed by state officials. The court has also provided a path for reasonable cost recovery on critical infrastructure investments that PURA must adhere to in both ongoing and future rate proceedings.”
Others described the decision as a vindication of PURA and its embattled leader, Marissa Gillett. 
“This was another resounding affirmation of PURA’s well-reasoned, pro-consumer rejection of Aquarion’s unsubstantiated multi-million-dollar rate hike demand,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Aquarion sought excessive, unsupported profits, unnecessary ratepayer-supported bonuses, and unwarranted reimbursement for incomplete infrastructure projects. The company failed to meet its burden both before PURA and the court.”
“To me, this seems like more evidence that utilities should stop fighting with PURA, whether in the courts or in public media, and start working with them to reduce rates,” said state Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Government Administrations and Elections Committee.
A spokesperson for PURA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Earlier this year, Eversource announced its plans to sell Aquarion to the quasi-public Regional Water Authority in a deal worth $2.4 billion. The utility serves roughly 685,000 customers across the state.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0306_SR_AquarionReservoir_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 20:13:15.199060

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has announced proposed rules that remove the category of “special concern” species from its rule on threatened and endangered species. 
Species on the “special concern” list include bald eagles, peregrine falcons, southern flying squirrels, smooth green snakes and a number of butterflies. 
The move came as part of DNR’s adherence to the governor’s executive order to simplify administrative rules across agencies.
Tammie Krausman, the department’s public information officer, said the decision to remove the category allows the department’s administrative rules to follow the relevant chapter of Iowa statute. 
Krausman said in an email this will make the administrative rules “consistent with” the statute that “explicitly addresses that DNR responsibilities are to identify those species that are endangered or threatened in the state.” 
“The ‘special concern’ classification is not identified in that law,” Krausman said.
This is not the first notice DNR has put out about its efforts to refine its administrative code. In fact, all state agencies have been completing the same work following an executive order, known as Executive Order 10, signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2023. 
The executive order created a moratorium on administrative rulemaking and ordered agencies to complete a “comprehensive review” of all existing administrative rules. Reynolds, in the release about the order, said it was a “commonsense approach that gets government out of the way and leads to a more robust economy in every community.”
The order also called for an evaluation and “rigorous cost benefit analysis” of existing rules to determine if the public benefits justified the cost. 
A press release from DNR about the proposed rule change regarding special concern species said “there is no change in policy or enforcement in the new rule.”
Many of the special concern species have small populations in the state, like peregrine falcons, which were reintroduced in Iowa and are regularly monitored by DNR staff and Iowa volunteers. 
Some species from the “special concern” category were moved to the threatened or endangered category in the proposed rules. Species moved to the “threatened” list include: black tern, pirate perch, bullsnake, two spotted skipper, and regal fritillary. Species moved to the “endangered” list include: pugnose shiner, dusted skipper and ottoe skipper. 
Wally Taylor, legal and conservation chair with the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, said it was “a problem” to remove the special concern category from the administrative rules. 
“Even though those species have no legal protection, at least the public is aware that those species need to be considered and carefully watched, and so does the DNR,” Taylor said. “Without those being on the list, the DNR can conveniently say, ‘Well, they’re not listed, we don’t need to worry about them, and … the public doesn’t know enough to be concerned.” 
Taylor has opposed several changes DNR has made in its efforts to follow Reynolds’ order, and is involved in a lawsuit against the state that alleges the governor does not have the authority to make agencies adopt less-restrictive standards. 
Krausman said the list of special concern species will continue to be part of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan, and she said the department will “actively monitor the status of these species.”
DNR is accepting informal comments from the public on the proposed rule changes through July 15. Those interested can submit their written comments via email to John Pearson and Kelly Poole at the department : john.pearson@dnr.iowa.gov and kelly.poole@dnr.iowa.gov.

The Montana Public Service Commission will consider a fine amount later this month against North Star Development, the utility of a Helena area subdivision whose residents have been under repeated water restrictions.
PSC President Brad Molnar made the announcement Tuesday at the agency’s business meeting — and a resident of the subdivision said he hopes the commissioners have the political will to push for a steep penalty.
“I hope they set the heaviest fine they can,” said resident Duane Schlabach in a phone call.
Molnar said the fine will require court action.
The North Star utility is a small, privately-owned water service that serves roughly 270 residents in the North Star subdivision near Helena. Schlabach said some neighbors have grown increasingly frustrated with repeated water restrictions, and others have thrown up their hands.
A memo from the North Star utility dated July 3 said the policy for this summer is to allow lawn sprinkling only for two one-hour periods every other day (one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening).
It said the limitation does not affect the use of water for “normal indoor domestic use.”
“The Utility reserves its ability to further limit water use should circumstances or conditions require further limitation,” the memo said.
“We end up with a different problem, same result, year after year after year,” Schlabach said.
The memo came after an email on July 1 that said North Star was experiencing “a water emergency situation,” and it was working to “resolve the issue as quickly as possible.”
“We ask that residents please note: NO WATERING FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.”
The PSC regulates the water utility, and residents have reported complaints about water delivery since 2020, according to an agency memo.
In a brief phone call Wednesday, Doug Boutilier, owner of North Star, said he pays “a ton of money” every month to Rocky Mountain Operations, which fixed the most recent problem — an apparent electrical short that affected water pumps and required replacing parts, according to the PSC — within a couple of hours.
“Now the water is fine,” Boutilier said.
Boutilier also said every subdivision in Helena of which he’s aware has water restrictions. He hung up before the Daily Montanan could ask questions about the repairs or the memo outlining restrictions for the summer.
A public information officer for the city of Helena could not be reached Wednesday regarding other water restrictions in the area.
Recently, a couple of Helena legislators also have asked the Public Service Commission to ensure North Star residents don’t lose water again. Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell raised concerns in a couple of forums this week including at the PSC. Dunwell said she knows the PSC shares her concern about the reliability of the water service and wanted to let them know she heard about the water shutoff just the previous week.
She said a resident told her she woke up one morning with no water from the tap, not to drink or shower, and she had children at home for the summer.
“You almost know it’s summer when North Star runs out of water again,” said Dunwell, a Helena Democrat.
In a phone call, Rep. Julie Darling said she is starting to learn about the issue and confirmed she had left a message for the PSC about it.
She said the residents have a reasonable expectation that when they turn on their faucets, they’ll get water, but it seems the issues related to water service “have been falling through the cracks.”
“Water is a basic human right. It really is,” said Darling, a Helena Republican.
In December 2024, the PSC approved an order to fine the utility for “significant” service and reliability issues related to water.
Tuesday, Molnar said state law requires the PSC to file a case in district court “calculating and justifying a specific penalty amount based on evidence gathered in the commission’s investigation.”
Molnar also said the commission is in the process of gathering information about “the service interruption” that took place earlier this month.
“As further details regarding this incident become available, the commission will respond appropriately,” Molnar said. “The commission sympathizes with the customers’ concerns, and the commission is exercising the authority it has.”
At the meeting Tuesday, he did not name a specific date for the work session where commissioners will discuss the amount of the penalty they will seek.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MaxPixel.net-Pipe-Faucet-Water-3863039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With open seats and competitive races across Iowa’s state and federal offices on the horizon in the 2026 election, campaign announcements — and exits — were announced this week for Iowa’s congressional seats.
One announcement came Tuesday as Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl launched his campaign for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, a seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra who is looking at a run for governor. While Windschitl is currently the highest-profile Republican in the race, other Republicans have announced campaigns for the seat in the longtime conservative stronghold, including Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan.
Iowa Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, had also announced an exploratory committee for the 4th District seat in May. But on Wednesday, he announced plans to seek reelection to the Iowa Senate instead of pursuing a congressional campaign.

“After visiting with hundreds of Iowans over the past six weeks, and much self-reflection, my passion remains with our work in the Iowa Senate and at the Capitol in Des Moines,” Evans said in a statement. “I remain grateful for this opportunity given to me by my constituents. I intend to earn their continued support between now and next November.”
Evans said he was met with a support and encouragement that was “nothing short of overwhelming” during his time considering a run in the 4th District. However, he said he planned to continue to work on education policy, tax changes and eminent domain as a state legislator instead of running for Congress.
Evans had announced he was considering a run after Feenstra had put his hat into the race to succeed Gov. Kim Reynolds. The governor said in April she would not seek reelection in 2026. Reynolds’ announcement came as a surprise to many in Iowa politics, and has already sparked changes among state and federal Republicans holding office.
Nunn mulls gubernatorial bid
Feenstra may not be the only U.S. representative to leave their position to run for governor. The Des Moines Register reported Monday that sources close to U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, is also considering joining the primary race to become Iowa’s Republican gubernatorial nominee.
Nunn had previously stated he does not plan to run for governor. But the Register reported sources close to Nunn say recent announcements in the GOP primary field caused him to reconsider this decision — specifically, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird’s announcement that she will not run for governor. With longstanding ties to President Donald Trump, Bird was considered a possible top contender in the gubernatorial race. Bird earlier in July she plans to run for a second term as attorney general.
Nunn’s campaign staff did not respond to a request Wednesday for comment on a potential campaign for governor.
In addition to the two U.S. representatives, Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, also has an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial campaign, and Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have officially launched campaigns for governor. Among Democrats, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and former political operative Julie Stauch have launched campaigns as gubernatorial candidates.
Nunn’s potential run for governor would turn Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District campaign into an open race. The seat is expected to be one of the most competitive U.S. House districts in 2026. Two Democrats, Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst and Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, are running for the seat.
New Democrat joins 1st District primary race
Iowa’s 1st Congressional Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, has also been marked as a potential competitive district in the upcoming election. Over the past few months, several Democrats have announced campaigns to run against Miller-Meeks for the seat, including Democrat Christina Bohannan, who lost to Miller-Meeks by less than 800 votes in 2024, former legislator Bob Krause and Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care.
On Tuesday, Taylor Wettach, a lawyer from Muscatine, joined the field. Wettach formerly worked for Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a New York-based law firm, but said he resigned from his job after the firm “caved to Trump’s bullying and cut a deal to do his legal work for free.” The Associated Press reported in April that Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP was one of five firms that agreed to provide $125 million in free legal services to avoid executive actions other legal organizations are facing from the Trump administration.
Wettach said quitting his job wasn’t easy, but “real change never comes easy, neither does fighting for what’s right” in a video announcing his run for Congress. If elected, the 34-year-old Democrat said he would work to support public schools, oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare and advocate against trade wars that could impact Iowa businesses and farms.
“We can achieve all of that and send Mariannette Miller-Meeks packing if we’re ready to embrace full change and new leadership,” Wettach said. “I’m committed to building that movement from the ground floor up.”
Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson with the National Republican Congressional Committee, criticized “East Coast Elitist” Wettach for joining the “clown car Democrat primary” in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann also issued a statement opposing Wettach, saying that he and other Democratic candidates will lose to Miller-Meeks in 2026.
“East Coast liberal lawyer Taylor Wettach is the latest out-of-touch Democrat to join the messy primary to decide who’s going to lose to Mariannette Miller-Meeks this time around,” Kaufmann said. “Whether it’s Wettach, two-time loser Christina Bohannan, Bernie Sanders socialist Travis Terrell, or extreme radical Bob Krause who survives, none are a match for America-First fighter Mariannette Miller-Meeks and her strong record of delivering for Iowans. Welcome back to Iowa, Taylor.”

A check from California’s largest property insurer, which says it has paid billions of dollars in claims from the LA-area fires, has taken more than a week to clear so far.


Amelia McDonald couldn’t believe her ears. She had been navigating what she calls “a horrible experience” trying to get her claims paid by State Farm after the Eaton Fire burned down her Altadena home and ranch in January. She, along with her father, daughter and the goats that survived the fire, have been displaced since then.
Now a $876,354.07 check the insurer wrote her wouldn’t clear. 
McDonald called the check-hold department of her bank, Chase, Tuesday, asking why the funds from the check she deposited on June 30 were not available more than a week later. She said someone there told her it was because State Farm — the state’s largest property insurer — had insufficient funds. In fact, he told her, the account had a negative balance. 
She called the same department today, and reached someone who told her he expected the check to finally clear July 10. But she pressed for details about the reason for the delay and asked to speak with a manager, who told her that the funds have been on hold because the bank wasn’t sure the check would clear.
“It’s just stunning,” McDonald told CalMatters. “I’m an insurance defense attorney. I’ve been working for insurance companies for more than 20 years. I’ve never had a check bounce to a claimant in 25 years of practice.”
State Farm is the largest property insurer in California. It said Monday in an update on its website that it has paid more than $4.2 billion on almost 13,000 claims from the Los Angeles County fires.
“I really hope they’re not in so much trouble,” McDonald said. “Then we’re all in trouble.”
“After review on our end, we see no indication why the bank would not release the funds to our customer,” a State Farm spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CalMatters. 
State Farm would not talk about McDonald’s interactions with her bank, or the allegation about insufficient funds.
Earlier this year, State Farm said claims from the LA-area fires would worsen its financial condition and potentially drive it out of California, where it has either canceled or refused to renew tens of thousands of policies. In May, State Farm received an unprecedented approval from the state to raise its rates on an emergency interim basis. Among the company’s arguments during a public hearing was that its credit rating had been downgraded, and that its solvency and therefore the policies of more than 1 million California homeowners were at real risk.
State Farm is facing lawsuits related to the fires that include complaints about its handling of smoke-damage claims and allegations that it systemically underinsured policy holders. In addition, California’s insurance department last month opened a formal investigation into the company’s handling of claims.
Michael Soller, spokesperson for the insurance department, said the department is investigating this issue with McDonald’s claim with State Farm. He would not comment about the check-clearing delay. An insurance compliance officer with the department, who McDonald emailed yesterday about the delay, responded to her today and said she has contacted State Farm and given the company five days to respond, according to an email seen by CalMatters.

Amy Bach, an attorney who co-founded consumer advocacy group United Policyholders more than 30 years ago, said she has never heard of a check from an insurer bouncing — though technically the check has only been on hold. 
“That’s scary,” she said, adding that “people need a reality check on the financial realities of the enormous claims from the LA fires.”
Michael Bidart, an attorney who has litigated insurance cases, said he has never heard of an insurer’s check bouncing, either. But he has heard of insurers going insolvent, he added.  
The nearly $900,000 in funds McDonald is waiting for is for coverage of her house and ranch. State Farm also issued her a check for $335,527.40 for the loss of contents on her property, according to records seen by CalMatters. She deposited that check in a different bank account.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson vowed Wednesday to use state dollars to plug a hole Republicans left by barring Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services in their sweeping tax cut and spending bill.
“The one thing we have to do is make sure that individuals in our state have access to the critical, critical services provided by Planned Parenthood,” Ferguson said in a press conference outside one of the organization’s clinics in Seattle.
The moratorium took effect when President Donald Trump signed his so-called “big, beautiful bill” into law Friday. The provision lasts one year. 
This week, a federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily directed the Trump administration to continue the flow of funding to Planned Parenthood, which on top of abortions provides access to birth control and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections at health centers across the country.
Federal Medicaid funding can’t pay for abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother or is the product of rape or incest.
The judicial order lasts two weeks. The case brought by Planned Parenthood will continue through the courts.
If the legal fight isn’t successful, Ferguson committed to backfilling the $11 million Planned Parenthood in Washington stands to lose. He said he would divert the money from the state Health Care Authority.
This comes not long after Ferguson signed a new budget from lawmakers that cut state funding for an abortion care program by more than half. Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates called that reduction “devastating.”
The group’s CEO, Jennifer Allen, said Wednesday that “this is not the moment when the federal government should be coming in and interfering with our state’s values and with our patients’ access to badly needed health care.”
“We are here for our patients,” she continued. “We are undaunted, but it does take money to provide care, and this is a hit on Planned Parenthood and on our state.”
Allen applauded Ferguson’s promise, and said many other states aren’t as fortunate. 
In Washington, Planned Parenthood’s 30 health centers serve over 100,000 patients each year. Medicaid covers nearly half of them, according to the nonprofit. Planned Parenthood has previously closed clinics in Washington due to low Medicaid reimbursement rates.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3778-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is instituting new hoot-owl restrictions on rivers in the southwest and central Montana beginning Thursday, in response to warm temperatures and low streamflows across the state.
The fishing restrictions prohibit angling on the designated stretches of river from 2 p.m. to midnight each day and will remain in place until conditions improve.
The new restrictions are as follows:

Ruby River — lower stretch, from the confluence with the Beaverhead River to Duncan District Road
Jefferson River — entire river, from the confluence of the Big Hole and Beaverhead rivers to the Missouri River
Big Hole River — from Saginaw Bridge on Skinner Meadows Road to the confluence with the North Fork of the Big Hole River (Section 1), and from Tony Schoonen FAS to the confluence with the Beaverhead River (Section 5)
Beaverhead River – lower stretch, from Highway 41 near East Bench Road and Beaverhead Rock to its confluence with the Big Hole River
Smith River – from the confluence of the North and South forks of the Smith River to Eden Bridge

Hoot-owl restrictions are already in place on the upper Madison River above Hebgen Lake, and on the lower Madison River from Warm Springs BLM day-use area downstream to the confluence with the Jefferson River near Three Forks. On the Sun River, the restrictions are in place from the mouth of Muddy Creek to the Highway 287 Bridge.
To check for other restrictions, click here.
In accordance with the department’s drought policy, FWP institutes angling restrictions when streamflows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm and can help reduce catch-and-release mortality by restricting fishing to only cool morning hours.
Catch-and-release anglers can reduce stress on fish by getting them to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
As the summer warms, Montana offers many other angling options with better conditions for fish, including larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation lakes and streams.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

In 2024, the historically Black university requested $50 million to build a nursing school for its growing class of future health care providers. The legislature ultimately rejected the request, giving KSU money to design the building but not construct it. 
Some lawmakers criticized that denial as the latest in a historic pattern of “underinvestment” in Black educational institutions.

In 2026, KSU is seeking $54 million to build the center, Wayne Cowan, the director of capital planning and gacilities, told the Capital Planning Advisory Board. 
The money would create classrooms and conference space, a learning lab with a virtual hospital, study spaces, offices and other meeting rooms. 
“KSU’s School of Nursing is poised to grow exponentially with the further development of present and new academic programs to help in making America healthy again,” one slide from KSU’s presentation read. 
No money to build new nursing school raises old question: ‘When will it be Kentucky State’s time?’

The money KSU received in the last budget has helped the university “turn a corner,” Cowan said. Recent improvements to campus include sidewalk and building repairs. 
“We’re starting to move toward the progress that we all hoped for, for Kentucky State,” Cowan said. “We’ve got a lot of work to do, but we started into some of the work on site that’s able to help us really serve our students well.”  
Marcus Bernard, the dean of the College of Agriculture, Health Sciences and Natural Resources, and director of land grant programs, said he also wants to see a floor or space dedicated to nutrition. 
“In that health and nutrition space, we’ll focus on health education nutrition programs that will also be connected to our mobile health units that are now funded to be in the eastern part of the state, West Louisville, and to also have one that’s moving across the state,” he said. 
The mobile units in Eastern Kentucky and West Louisville — both areas where poverty is common —  “focus on nutrition education, metabolic testing for chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension,” he said.

Other pitches 
KSU was one of a slew of public colleges and universities that presented their needs to the legislature’s Capital Planning Advisory Board. The panel is fielding budget pitches ahead of the 2026 legislative session, during which the General Assembly will pass a new two-year budget.
Other likely education requests for 2026 include: 

Eastern Kentucky University: $330 million for a Center for Health Innovation; $50 million for accreditation escrow for a doctor of osteopathic medicine program; $10 million for Air Traffic Control & Aircraft; $75 million for asset preservation. 
Kentucky Community and Technical College System: $30 million in safety and security; $320 million in asset preservation. 
Morehead State University: $79 million for a new applied science building; $31 million for a new agricultural science building; $24 million for a new space science and emerging technology building; $20 million for a new Health Science Center.  
Murray State University: $100 million for the E&G Building Systems Improvement Pool; $49 million for an emergency veterinary and teaching Clinic; $60 million to construct a UofL Medical Sciences building partnership. 
University of Kentucky: $500 million for a science research facility; $250 million for asset preservation; $300 million for a data center. 
University of Louisville: $142 million for a STEM academic center; $75 million for an artificial intelligence center; $40 million for a student health center.

BARRE — President Donald Trump’s broad budget changes, which were signed into law last week, will be “devastating to rural America,” U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said at a press conference Wednesday. She predicted large-scale loss of access to health care and food assistance for Vermonters, among other public services.
The White House has called parts of the bill “the largest tax cuts in history,” with substantial breaks on tips and overtime, and for adults over 60. Balint, however, urged Vermonters to consider the long-term effects of the bill. 
In a release Tuesday, she referenced a congressional Joint Economic Committee Minority report that predicted 35,242 Vermonters could lose access to Medicaid coverage as a result of the bill. The Vermont Agency of Human Services has projected roughly 45,000 people total could lose insurance statewide.

Balint criticized the added administrative demands of the new Medicaid reforms, in particular the proof-of-work requirement. She called conservative claims that many covered patients are willfully unemployed “erroneous.” 
“They’re the working poor, and they rely on Medicaid for their insurance,” she said.
A June 29 statement from the White House said the intent of the bill was “strengthening the integrity of Medicaid by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.” 
However, Ashley Berliner, the state director of health care policy, said her team’s focus was to maintain as high a rate of insurance coverage as possible.
“We don’t have any evidence to suggest that there are a bunch of people in the [Medicaid] expansion population who aren’t working and aren’t meeting other exemptions,” she said Wednesday.
Berliner added that the administrative burden itself will be costly for Vermonters. The new requirements will “impede people’s ability to get on and stay on Medicaid,” she said.
“They’re trying to make it difficult,’” Balint said Wednesday. “It is transparent.”
Balint also highlighted the potential cost of losing the flow of federal money into Vermont’s health care industry, citing a Congressional Budget Office report from December. 
“When you suck that much money out of the health care system, it is going to drive up everyone’s premiums,” she said.
The state’s largest health insurance company, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont, is already in financial peril in large part due to its administration of Medicare Advantage plans. Officials say the provider’s failure could cause the state’s health industry to collapse. This year already saw the company seek significant hikes in premium costs, some parts of which have been modified and approved by the Green Mountain Care Board.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont spokesperson Sara Teachout said the effects for premium rates are impossible to predict. 
“These are important questions that we do not have the answers to yet,” she wrote in an email.
The federal budget bill also contains provisions to reduce spending on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would result in a roughly $285 million decrease for the program over the next decade. The report additionally detailed tighter restrictions on SNAP eligibility, such as extending the proof-of-work age requirement by a decade, to those 64 and under. The bill also appears to withdraw SNAP eligibility for some refugees and residents who have been granted asylum.
“Vermonters are already hungry,” Balint said. “It is a cruel, cruel bill.”
Anore Horton, the executive director of Hunger Free Vermont, said the state’s charitable food system is already “stretched beyond the limits.” Roughly 65,000 Vermonters currently participate in SNAP, according to Horton.
The new cuts could mean that 13,000 of them lose SNAP access, Horton told NBC5.
In the coming years, Balint said, the Vermont Legislature and Gov. Phil Scott’s administration will face “really tough decisions” in order to meet the basic needs of their constituents. 
“There are no easy answers here,” Balint said.

During the announcement, Sanders praised Anderson’s commitment to conservation and to educating young people about conservation and getting involved in the outdoors, adding that they aligned “perfectly” with her administration’s recently-announced outdoor education initiative.

“I know that during his term on the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, he’ll put his energy towards preserving, protecting and promoting Arkansas’ great outdoors, because he cares about building a future in which our state’s greatest natural resource is available to every single Arkansan,” Sanders said. 
Anderson thanked Sanders for the nomination, calling it “a dream come true.”
“Anyone who knows me knows that I eat, sleep and breathe the outdoors. It’s not just what I do in my free time, it’s my life’s work,” Anderson said. “For the past 32 years, I’ve worked on our family fish farm, learning every day if you don’t take care of the resource, it will not take care of you.”
Anderson praised the commission, saying it is one of the best regarded game and fish agencies in the country.
“At a time when some states are politicizing and weaponizing agencies that are charged with managing their natural resources, I’m proud to say Arkansas stands firm,” Anderson said. “We’re committed to a biological and common sense approach.”
Neeley also spoke, advising Anderson to “listen, listen, listen” to the commission’s staff, whom he described as being some of the best at what they do. It was “amazing” how many different things AGFC touched and dealt with, Neeley said.
“Game and Fish is the tip of the spear of conservation,” Neeley said. 
In addition to his latest appointment to the AGFC, Anderson has been on the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board since 2017, and was previously appointed by President Donald Trump to the National Wildlife Services Advisory Committee.
Anderson was a donor to Sanders’ 2022 campaign, contributing roughly $5,800, according to Open Secrets’ campaign donor database.

In his early years, Dante Anderson was in awe of the graceful yet forceful karate moves he saw in action movies — particularly the 2010 “Karate Kid” film with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan. 
Now, he’s headed to the world championships. 
Sherlyn Anderson, a single mother who moved to the U.S. from Nicaragua, said her son Dante blossomed when he enrolled in a dojo to learn karate at 5 years old. She continued to support his dream and dedication to martial arts throughout the past eight years, Anderson told VTDigger.
This winter, the 13-year-old of Rutland City was the only Vermonter to qualify to represent the U.S. in the World Karate-Do Alliance World Championships held in Malta in March 2026. There, Anderson said he plans to compete in the advanced category, performing a Kata — a solo choreography of karate techniques called Shito-ryu — and a weapons demonstration called Kobudo, with a staff called the kai-bo.
Anderson will be joining a dozen others representing the U.S. at the World Championships, said José Dimacali, the sensei for House of Samurai in Londonderry, New Hampshire. Anderson’s positive and respectful demeanor stood out to him when selecting people for Team USA, Dimacali said, adding that Anderson has a “great mat presence” and that “he knows how to carry himself inside the ring.”
“When we’re teaching him the new style of karate, there was no negativity. He was so eager to learn,” Dimacali said.  “For me, that’s the most important.”
Anderson reigns undefeated in martial arts championships, placing first in all Twin State Championships, joint state competitions in Vermont and New Hampshire this year. He also achieved a triple crown victory this year — winning three events in one season including form, sparring and weapons, Dimacali said.
Anderson practices his craft every day, he said, and trains alongside other kids from age 6 to 17 at the dojo.
“It doesn’t matter what age you are. As long as you’re in the tournament team, you got to bring it as hard, you got to train as hard as the other kids. So if you’re younger, you got to train as hard as the old kids,” Anderson said. “To get into this level, I needed to be the best for myself.”
Anderson is the only Vermonter attending regular online classes with his dojo the House of Samurai, said Rebecca Dimacali, program director for House of Samurai, and he trains twice a month in person at the Londonderry dojo, which demonstrates his commitment to training for the World Championship and the team.
Anderson said he is versed in his performance techniques, but he hopes to increase the speed of his movement through his training regime in preparation for the World Championships.
Along with the skills he has learned through his karate training, Anderson said he has also learned the principles of discipline and self control that apply to all interactions in his life. He said his motivation to keep practicing karate is to make his mother “proud and happy.”
After Anderson competes in the World Championship, Sensei José Dimacali said he plans to invite Anderson to advance from the state Twin Valley Championships to compete in regional competitions, recognizing his skill and future in martial arts. 
Once he reaches the age of 18, Anderson said, he hopes to use his skills to compete in the professional championships and eventually open his own dojo to spread the knowledge of martial arts to communities that do not have access. 
There is a sense of camaraderie in martial arts practice, Anderson said, and he finds the encouraging environment helps everybody on his team thrive. 
“In the dojo, we all support each other and we push each other,” Anderson said. “What my sensei says is: ‘If you’re at the dojo or even if you’re at the tournament, if you want to be better, push others.’”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A Republican state legislator from Madison filed his statement of candidacy Wednesday to run for South Dakota’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Casey Crabtree is the second Republican to take a formal step toward running, after Attorney General Marty Jackley. Current Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor next year.

Crabtree, 42, who currently serves in the state Senate, submitted paperwork to the Federal Election Commission. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but did share his interest in a statement issued last week.
“I’m thankful for Dusty’s work in Congress supporting South Dakota and Trump’s America First agenda,” he said at the time. “South Dakota has had giants like John Thune, Kristi Noem, and Dusty Johnson represent us in the U.S. House, and those are big shoes to fill. My family and I have received a lot of encouragement across the state to consider a bid for this open seat. I am strongly considering this opportunity and we will look at this as a family through prayer and serious conversations.”
Jackley announced his campaign last month, the same day Johnson publicly scheduled his announcement for governor. Jackley has since filed with the Federal Election Commission.
Crabtree works as an economic development director for Heartland Energy in Madison, and served as state Senate majority leader during the 2023 and 2024 legislative sessions.
The Republican primary election is in June 2026, with the statewide general election to follow in November 2026.
Besides Crabtree and Jackley, James Bialota, who describes himself as a small business owner and real estate investor, has said on Facebook that he plans to run as a Republican for the U.S. House.
A Democrat named Scott Schlagel has also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the House seat.

Tim Walz and Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Natalie Hudson listened to the testimony of dozens of people seeking clemency on July 9, 2025. Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer. Jessica Persaud’s 13-month-old son accidentally drowned in her bathtub in 2008, and she pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter for the “biggest mistake of my life.”
Persaud, who sat next to her daughter Alana Perkins, tearfully told the three-member pardon board on Wednesday that she lives everyday with guilt and sorrow and had often thought about giving up. But she knew her daughter needed her.

“If I could have the opportunity to have this pardon, I can have the chance to finally process and mourn the way a mother should,” Persaud told the board, comprising Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Supreme Court Chief Justice Natalie Hudson.
In 2008, Persaud, then 24, placed her 13-month-old son in the bathtub and ran the water, thinking the drain was unplugged. She left the bathroom to talk to her friend on the phone while doing some housework. When she returned, Persaud discovered a toy had plugged the drain and her son was floating in the tub, unresponsive. He later was pronounced dead.
Persaud’s daughter Perkins said she’s watched her mother “destroy” herself over the years for the accidental drowning. Persaud’s been a loving mother, Perkins said, and she asked the pardon board to give her mother a second chance.
The Minnesota Board of Pardons was moved by Persaud’s remorse and granted her a pardon on Wednesday 3-0.
“After the tragic loss, you poured all that love into your surviving daughter and obviously have done a great job raising a child who loves you,” Walz told her. “I just don’t see why this serves justice or society to have this on your record.”
Dozens of people with stains on their records Wednesday asked the Board of Pardons for a pardon or commutation.
The Minnesota Legislature in 2023 made it easier for people convicted of crimes or serving sentences to get clemency. In the past, the board’s vote had to be unanimous. Now the governor and just one other board member must vote “yes.”
Prior to 2023, Minnesota had the senior elected officials go through each case, in person, in public, flanked by a bevy of staffers and the state prison director. That’s one reason Minnesota has granted fewer pardons and commutations than most states.
Now the process occurs largely behind closed doors, similar to other states. Applicants and victims make their case to a new Clemency Review Commission, which reviews pardon and commutation applications and makes recommendations to the pardon board. The attorney general, governor and chief justice still meet publicly, but merely to review the recommendations and vote. It’s intended to streamline the process and get more people pardoned. Rather than considering dozens of requests twice a year, the board will go through hundreds.
Persaud said Wednesday that the pardon will help her mental health and her future employment prospects while empowering her to finish getting a degree.
“I am not the same woman I was all those years ago. I am stronger and committed to living a life grounded in love, growth and compassion for my daughter, for the memory of my son and for a future I still believe in,” Persaud told the pardon board.
By the end of the eight-hour meeting, the board granted 33 pardons; denied three and commuted one sentence; and denied two commutation requests.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2928-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Courtesy of U.S. Department of Energy)Degraded infrastructure and lax federal oversight of maintenance contractors threatens future operation of the only underground nuclear storage site in Southern New Mexico, according to a recent report issued by a federal watchdog.
Maintenance concerns at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, which lies underground in a saltbed outside of Carlsbad, comes as federal officials plan to accept radioactive waste until the 2080s — more than 50 years beyond the original expectation.
The federal government contracts out daily operations and maintenance at WIPP, and has used the Salado Isolation Mining Contractors at the site since 2022.
In June, the Government Accountability Office issued its findings on WIPP maintenance and facilities, noting that more than half of the necessary equipment and infrastructure (called “mission-critical”) is reported to be in “poor and substandard conditions.”
The report notes that according to the U.S. Department of Energy — which oversees U.S. nuclear weapons programs, including disposal — having infrastructure in poor condition “increases the potential for infrastructure failure, allowing greater risk of unforeseen delay to waste disposal operations or shutdown of the site.”
Federal officials in the Carlsbad Field Office said WIPP has been in a “reactionary mode” to keep up with repairs and aging equipment since a series of 2014 accidents, which shut down operations for several years, according to the report.
WIPP only had a projected lifespan of 25 years, Don Hancock, a decades-long anti-nuclear advocate in New Mexico with the Southwest Research and Information Center, told Source NM.
“Because of the obsolescence of many things in this facility, these problems will continue to occur,” Hancock said. “This facility was never supposed to, and won’t, successfully operate for 80 to 85 years without other accidents.”
The report noted some improvements since a 2016 review, which documented more than $37 million worth of repairs that occurred behind schedule and with missed deadlines. However, new problems  have since emerged.
Those problems include  a shaft used to transport salt removed from underground that underwent emergency refurbishment in 2024 due to “a high risk of failure,” after salt pushed into the shaft faster than expected. The report noted that other replacements were needed, such as a salt hoist built 1924 and installed at WIPP in 1984.
Contractors have identified more than 100 priority repairs at WIPP, which extend into 2033, but missing or incomplete data about the condition of the infrastructure have continued to occur, the report found. Federal officials failed to hold contractors accountable for the lapses and did not set timelines for fixes to be in place, the report said.
The report concludes that federal officials need to enact further oversight, such as grading contractors on their long-term planning efforts in contract evaluations; ensuring data issues are addressed; and setting deadlines to implement fixes.
In a response letter, U.S. Department of Energy officials agreed to the recommendations, and said they would implement them in 2025 and 2026.
Hancock said the report highlights the need for further nuclear storage options, outside of New Mexico.
“As long as WIPP is the only repository — whether it’s safe or not, whether it’s obsolete or not, whether it’s falling apart or not, whether they’re adequately maintaining it or not — if it’s the only one, everything ultimately will be shoehorned in,” Hancock said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIPP_Salt_Pocket_2024_11_12-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislative leaders are scheduled to go into a closed-door session on Friday to discuss a possible lawsuit over a veto error.
It’s a conversation that should happen out in the open because lawmakers should be transparent about their thinking and decision-making.
The interim Legislative Management Committee is weighing next steps, including legal action or a possible special session, after a snafu with Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s line-item veto of some housing funds.
Armstrong intended to veto $150,000 in one-time funds for a Native American homeless liaison, but a red X on the bill returned to Legislative Council also crossed out $25 million for a housing program and $10 million to combat homelessness. 
Armstrong’s office has described it as a “staff markup error.” Attorney General Drew Wrigley reviewed the matter and concluded Armstrong was clear about his intent in his veto message. Wrigley’s opinion governs what public officials do unless his decision is challenged in court.
But attorneys for the Legislature have raised concerns about setting a precedent that could have unintended consequences in the future. They argue Wrigley’s opinion conflicts with a 2018 North Dakota Supreme Court opinion that said a governor cannot withdraw a veto. They also question why Wrigley doesn’t mention the 2018 opinion in his analysis.
Lawmakers weigh possible legal action, special session to address veto error

Legislative Management discussed the matter in public last month. Members directed their attorneys to further explore the pros and cons of legal action, such as petitioning the Supreme Court for an injunction or other remedy. 
Friday’s meeting will be in public, though lawmakers will be participating remotely. The agenda has an executive session “for the purpose of attorney consultation regarding actions available to the Legislative Assembly, including litigation,” related to the veto. It cites statutes that allow exemptions from the open records and open meetings laws for attorney work product, attorney consultation and negotiation preparation.
Lawmakers would have to come back into an open meeting to take any votes or other action. But as someone who’s sat in the hallway for more than a few executive sessions, what often happens is the bulk of the decision-making unfolds behind closed doors. The public portion is typically a very brief vote with little to no discussion.
Even though lawmakers can use attorney consultation to justify a closed-door session, it doesn’t mean they have to. They can choose to do their jobs in front of their constituents.
It’s worth noting that the statute says an executive session may be held “only when an open meeting would have an adverse fiscal effect” on the bargaining position of the public entity. It’s questionable whether that applies here.
It’s also unclear if any legal memos produced for legislators to review on Friday will be public. I inquired with Legislative Council and was told that it likely depends on the outcome of the executive session.
Lawmakers have already had preliminary discussions with their lawyers on this. What do they gain from secrecy? Other than perhaps sidestepping an uncomfortable public discussion about the governor and the attorney general.
If the Legislature takes action, whether that’s a lawsuit or a special session, it’s going to cost tax dollars. That discussion ought to be held in view of the taxpayers.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3593edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

“Gone Guys” — a documentary about male social isolation and its consequences — is set to tour the state in a series of free screenings.

Adjusting 90 pounds of gym weights, a Vermont teenager named Gabe introduced himself to a visiting filmmaker before noting that growing up male could be a heavy lift.
“In my experience in school, like elementary school, I got in trouble a lot,” the boy told the man with a camera and microphone. “I felt very alone, and I just felt no one understood me. I think that a lot of the older generation, they might think that, you know, guys in my generation have much less drive.”
Instead, many boys and young men are struggling with social isolation and consequences such as substance abuse and suicide, state and national statistics show. That’s why the Montpelier-based Well Told Films is set to debut a new documentary, “Gone Guys,” this week to kick off a series of free screenings throughout Vermont.
“Something is out of sync for many boys and young men, and it’s showing up in classrooms, job sites and communities,” Dan Smith, president of the Vermont Community Foundation, said in an interview. “We recognize the urgency and opportunity to create space for people to better understand.”
Smith’s organization has teamed with the state’s Richard E. & Deborah L. Tarrant Foundation to sponsor the 45-minute film and follow-up talks.
“When we began researching this film, the idea of exploring the challenges facing boys and men was often met with confusion,” said its director, Chad Ervin. “But in conversation after conversation, two groups understood our focus immediately: parents of boys and educators. Their reaction was almost always the same: ‘Thank you. It’s about time.’”
Ervin and producer Angela Snow collected data as evidence of what they call a “quiet crisis.”
Men earned 13% more bachelor’s degrees than women in 1970, only to go on to receive 16% fewer degrees than women in the half-century since, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Boys now make up only one-third of U.S. high schoolers with the top 10% grade point averages, yet almost two-thirds of students in the bottom 10%, the center says.
The country’s work participation rate for “prime age” men has dropped from 97% in 1960 to 88% today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And men total 71% of all opioid deaths, while their suicide rate is four times the figure for women, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.
The documentary features interviews with Vermont educators, mentors and young men, as well as with Richard V. Reeves, author of the internationally recognized book “Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It.” 
“We’re landing at a moment when the nation is really starting to talk about this,” said Lauren Curry, executive director of the Tarrant Foundation. “I think this film invites everyone into the conversation.”
Addressing the rise of male disengagement, the online “manosphere” and radicalization, the film doesn’t advocate for any particular solution. Instead, it offers examples such as Montpelier High School’s “Healthy Masculinity” class, the University of Vermont’s “Men & Masculinities” program and the Associated General Contractors of Vermont’s trainings on overdose prevention and mental health.
“We always held firm to the focus of creating a film that seeks to listen to boys and young men and learn from their perspectives and priorities, not preach to them about what they should be doing,” Ervin said.
The film is set to open in St. Johnsbury on Thursday and Friday before moving on to free screenings and discussions in Bellows Falls, Brattleboro, Burlington, Montpelier and White River Junction.
“We must hold two truths at once,” said Smith from the Vermont Community Foundation. “That advancing opportunity for women and girls remains essential — and that boys and young men are struggling in ways we can no longer ignore.”

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) A Utah judge signed the execution warrant for death row inmate Ralph Menzies on Wednesday, setting a Sept. 5 date for the 67-year-old with dementia to die by firing squad. 
The warrant marks one of the final hurdles for the state in its attempt to execute Menzies, who has spent nearly 40 years on death row for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. It formally sets a date, and directs the Utah Department of Corrections to start planning for the execution. 
In signing the warrant, 3rd District Court Judge Matthew Bates also rejected a request from Menzies’ attorneys to pause proceedings to evaluate how serious the inmate’s dementia is. 
However, the question of whether Menzies is competent could still stand between him and a firing squad, and later this month Bates will decide whether the inmate should undergo another mental evaluation.

Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. After a monthslong competency hearing, doctors hired by Menzies’ legal team say he isn’t competent while doctors hired by the state say he is. 
Bates ultimately ruled last month that Menzies did have cognitive shortcomings, but did not meet the high bar to be deemed incompetent. However, the evaluations Bates based his ruling off of took place about a year ago, and in the months since, Menzies’ attorneys say his dementia has worsened. He can no longer articulate the state’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty, his attorneys say, and even has trouble with basic tasks like getting his food, getting dressed and cleaning his cell.

Earlier this week, his attorneys filed a petition to put proceedings on hold so Menzies could undergo another competency evaluation — and on Wednesday, after signing the execution warrant, Bates set a July 23 date to hear arguments for and against giving Menzies another competency evaluation. 
So, depending on how Bates rules during that hearing, the court could pause execution proceedings. Menzies’ attorneys are also appealing Bates’ initial ruling that found him competent to the Utah Supreme Court. 
But as of Wednesday, Bates could find no legal reason to stop him from signing the warrant. 
“Judge Bates has been very diligent and thorough, and I believe he made the right choice today,” said Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, after the ruling. He told reporters he was feeling “overwhelmed, very happy.” 
Meanwhile, Menzies’ attorney Eric Zuckerman called the notion of executing his client “inhumane.”

“He’s tethered to a wheelchair and an oxygen tank. And he’s not competent. This has gotten worse over the past year and we remain hopeful that the courts or the clemency board will recognize the inhumanity of taking a man like him into the death chair, taking him out of his wheelchair, and executing him. It’s wrong and Utah can do better,” Zuckerman said outside the courtroom. 
Zuckerman said Menzies wasn’t even aware of what was happening today, calling his understanding of his case immature, “something you would expect to see from a child.” 
“That’s where his cognitive functioning is going, he’s becoming more and more childlike and has more and more difficulty grasping what is going on around him,” Zuckerman said.  
But Hunsaker isn’t buying it. 
“I think it’s a tactic,” he said after the warrant was signed. “If I woke up this morning and I was in a jail cell and didn’t know anything about my life, I would be asking people. And they have not produced any evidence whatsoever that he’s waking up confused in the morning, that he doesn’t know why he’s there. They’re just saying he doesn’t understand things.”
Daniel Boyer, who was representing the state on Wednesday, echoed Hunsaker, telling reporters he doesn’t think there’s enough in the petition to warrant another evaluation. 
Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
“His life will be over in mere seconds,” said Hunsaker on Wednesday, when asked how he’s preparing for the execution. “My mom, we don’t know how long she stood and suffered in that grove, how long she bled to death and how she felt.” 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

What explains the fierce loyalty of Donald Trump’s base, even when he enacts laws that hurt them?


Arlie Russell Hochschild has searched for answers in the heart of Trump country. She is one of America’s most thoughtful writers about right wing movements, whose insights are informed by her deep relationships with people on the right. 
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her latest book, “Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame, and the Rise of the Right,” is based on her work in eastern Kentucky, where she spent seven years exploring one of the poorest and whitest areas in the country. Her 2016 book, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” was a finalist for the National Book Award. She is a regular contributor to the New York Times, which recently published her essay, “My Journey Deep in the Heart of Trump Country.”
Hochschild says that communities that have been ravaged by poverty, disinvestment and the opioid epidemic have suffered a deep loss of pride. Trump provides an appealing narrative by telling people that their pride has been stolen from them by undeserving immigrants, women, LGBTQ people, and African Americans, to name a few. Trump promises revenge for this stolen pride.
Arlie Hochschild spoke to me this week from her home in Maine.

David Goodman  
On July 4, Donald Trump signed into law his “Big Beautiful Bill.” It includes draconian cuts to government services that will shred the safety net that many of his working class supporters rely on. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next decade, some 17 million people will lose their health insurance and millions will see the loss or reduction of food assistance. Some one third of Americans will see their incomes decline and many rural hospitals are likely to close. Yet you report that in your conversations with people in eastern Kentucky that Trump’s followers are mostly happy with what he’s doing. Explain.
Arlie Hochschild  
They’re happy and confused and a little worried. We’re talking about an area of the country, Kentucky 5 (congressional district), which is the whitest and second poorest in the country. It’s coal country. They’ve become used to a kind of up and down economy, and now it’s been down. Like the 42% of all Americans (who are) without a B.A. degree and white, they have in the last three decades been downwardly mobile: less income, decline in owned property, more people living alone, and signs of what are called diseases of despair — alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicide, especially among men. So it’s kind of a depressed area. It has known better times, and now it’s bad times. 
Donald Trump speaks to a social vacuum and they didn’t see anything for them that the Democrats had to offer. Among registered voters (in this didstrict), 80% voted for Donald Trump, 20% voted for Harris, and 45% didn’t vote at all. So most people in this reddest of places actually didn’t vote for Trump but (Trump supporters) were the mobilized people. So you’ve got a loss story, and then a mobilization of people who are experiencing loss, and now what’s happened? Wham, they’re losing. Most of them are on Medicaid. All the children in this area qualify for Medicaid and their rural hospitals — there’s a major one in Pikeville, but without Medicaid money, it’s going to have to do layoffs — Head Start summer programs in public schools, all that will be gone. 
When I went back to the people that I wrote about In “Stolen Pride” about a month ago, they were not sure how this was going to land. They were keeping a close eye on tariffs and the effects that would have on the price of gas, the price of eggs, the price of bread, and worried, but they weren’t giving up (on Trump) yet. They had been promised some relief. Finally, someone’s come to save us, so they were hanging on. 
There was a metaphor that Donald Trump put out that sustained this that said, “America has been sick, and I’m the tariff doctor. I’m the budget cuts doctor. I will cure you, but it might hurt. There may be some chemo pain along the way, but hang on, and you’ll be cured at the end.” So that metaphor has been holding on. 
There is a counter metaphor that the Black man who is head of the Democratic Party in Kentucky told me: “Sometimes if (people who) look like me are called the enemy, then maybe you don’t mind when the president is peeing on your leg and calling it rain.”
So you have these two metaphors. One is a sense that, “Donald Trump is betraying me personally,” versus “Hey, catch on. It’s happening.”
David Goodman  
I feel like I got a glimpse of the world that you’re describing. A few weeks ago, my wife and I were riding bikes across western Pennsylvania on a famous rail trail called the Great Allegheny Passage. It follows a defunct rail line that once carried coal and steel, but those industries have died. So now it’s a beautiful bike trail and there are historical markers along the way explaining what once thrived here — this used to be a steel plant, or a coal mine. What struck us besides the wonderful biking was cycling through these small, rural downtowns that were just hollowed out. I kept thinking that this is like the land that time forgot. There has been no improvement here. They are like frozen in time from the 50s and 60s when the steel mills and the industries here closed and nothing has come in to replace it. There are just empty storefronts. 
What happened here in these Rust Belt communities that you write about in Kentucky and that I saw in western Pennsylvania? This is very much Trump country. 
Arlie Hochschild  
Yes, it is. What I saw was a group of people who would be called “stayers” — the people who haven’t left. I went in thinking there’s race, there’s social class, there’s rich, there’s poor. But I wasn’t thinking in terms of stayers and leavers. What I realized is that when an economy goes down and the center of economic gravity is somewhere else, a lot of people, often the more educated people and the younger people, leave. So there’s that new divide. The people who stay feel abandoned and feel a sense of anger and betrayal.
We have to think about emotional narratives. I think they’re the main thing going on and it’s unspoken. I believe that the conditions you biked through and that I saw over quite a few years are a story of a loss. Donald Trump came in and spoke to people predisposed to listen to a narrative that explained it and offered a way out. Trump came in with a promise to make America great again. Many politicians make promises, but there was also an unspoken narrative, which is, “You used to have a lot, and now you stayers have a little. It’s not just lost — it’s been stolen from you. Someone took it.”
David Goodman  
In your book “Strangers in their Own Land,” you talked about the “deep story” that people experienced in these places where they felt forgotten. Could you describe that deep story, and also how your sense of the deep story has evolved as you’ve continued to research and write?
Arlie Hochschild  
A deep story is what the world feels like to you. Your politics flow from that. The original deep story that I discovered in “Strangers” was this: you’re waiting in line, and you don’t feel like you’re angry at anyone, you don’t feel prejudiced. You just feel like you’re waiting in line for the American Dream. The line hasn’t moved in decades. You’re just waiting there, and the dream is far away. Many more are behind you, but you only look ahead. You’re sort of in the middle. The dream is just ahead, and you’re stuck. 
Moment two of that deep story is you see line cutters cutting in line ahead of you and pushing you back. Who are they? They’re women, African Americans, immigrants, refugees. You think, Oh this isn’t fair. And you look and you see that there’s President Obama who seems to be waving at the line cutters, legitimating them and pushing you back.
The final moment of the deep story is that someone ahead of you looks back and says, “You’re uneducated. You’re backward. You’re prejudiced. You’re a redneck.” Then you’re just insulted. You’ve lost all pride. You’ve been publicly humiliated. And you say, “I’m out of here. Whatever anybody has to offer me that’s an inch better than that, I’ll take.” 
That was the deep story that I heard and checked out in Louisiana for my first book. I brought it with me (and shared it with people in Kentucky) in “Stolen Pride.” One guy told me that what’s different now is that there’s a bully in line, and that bully is helping the line cutters. He’s not letting (me) go forward. He’s the bad bully. But also in line is a good bully. (Trump) is our bully who is fighting the bad bully. That’s how it feels. 
Feeling is underlying all politics. We need to not just focus on policies and logic, because often you don’t find that in a Trump speech. But there is an emotional logic that is allowing him to build up the kind of MAGA loyalty that he has. The bully is part of his appeal, that he’s going to be strong.
David Goodman  
It also explains something that I’ve found politically confounding, which is Trump promising as part of how to make America great again that “I am your retribution.” I’ve never heard a politician say that. He’s saying, I am going to inflict pain on those people. That’s the part that I find so disturbing, these displays of inflicting harm and terrorizing immigrants in Los Angeles and elsewhere. The pain is the point. It’s the theater of revenge.
Arlie Hochschild  
That’s right. There is a sequel to the narrative that I described in “Stolen Pride” of loss turning to shame, and then loss turn to stolen. Donald Trump says, “They took it from you.” Who is the “they?” It keeps getting expanded. 
What he also does in his narrative is to say, “I’m standing up for you. I’ve just said something transgressive and people are shaming me. Look at the press, they’re making me feel terrible. (You) know what that feels like to be shamed. Doesn’t it feel awful? They’re doing to me what they want to do to you, and I’m taking it on. I’m heroic, almost a religious figure. I’ll take your shame on. But unlike religious figures, I’m getting revenge. I’m getting retribution. I’m going to get even for the bad things and the shame that have occurred. And now I’m in power. It’s legitimate to feel angry.”
Elon Musk has said empathy is how civilizations get lost. If you count up the number of times Donald Trump says “hate” or “loser,” that’s part of this retribution. He’s establishing a category of insider and outsider – “And you my follower are the insiders. You’re American, American-born, really American. And these outsiders, the cause of your pain, they’ve been taking things from you.” He’s giving back their pride.
Here’s the paradox for me: I don’t see a whole lot of difference between this sinking blue collar white sector of America and migrants coming and trying to get a better life. They’re both at a border control. For migrants, it’s geographic control that they can’t get over. For white blue collar, it’s the B.A. they don’t have that could give them access to the jobs they seek. There’s a border control there too. Getting a B.A. is the knife that cuts between blue collar jobs that are going down and white collar jobs that are going up. You have two groups that actually have all this in common. (Trump) does a lot of rhetorical work to degrade and demean and demonize the non-American, and then he’s going to extend that category of non-American from undocumented workers to residents who are here legally and to people who don’t talk in an American way. There’s already a clampdown on dissent.
He is establishing what I would call new “feeling rules:” It is good to be angry. That’s the main thing he’s doing now, to put us in a different emotional atmosphere by saying, “It used to be rude or bad to be angry and impolite to insult people. Now that’s good.” 
Look what he’s done: he’s attacking universities, on the one hand, which should be the center of rational thought and civility, and he’s getting Ultimate Fighting on the White House lawn — anger, get it out. 
We’re in the middle of a new retribution narrative that’s playing out. It’s unspoken: “I’m recruiting you all to feel and act like soldiers in an army and I’m picking my enemy list, and you’re to join me.” That’s what the new deep story is.
David Goodman  
You’ve talked about the need to build “empathy bridges.” Explain what those are. And how do you build empathy bridges across a divide of retribution and anger? 
Arlie Hochschild  
Empathy bridges aren’t bridges of agreement. The Norwegians have a name for it that translates into “communities of difference.” You differ and you’re probably never going to agree. But that doesn’t mean you fall into silence. It doesn’t mean you’re hostile. It means you’re talking because you come to like each other and you think there’s common ground. 
The people I feature in “Stolen Pride,” we’re actually planning to all get together next October. We’re going to get a “holler log” going, including people who fear and hate Donald Trump and others who think he’s sent by God. 
David Goodman  
What are you going to do?
Arlie Hochschild  
We all need to learn to listen. Learning to listen and turning your own moral frame off temporarily so you can listen without defending your beliefs. Just listen. It’s an art, and I don’t think either side knows how to do it. Actually, polls have shown that people on the left are a little less good at doing this than people on the right, who are more likely rural or semi-rural. They live in more diverse communities than do people on the left. Studies also show that more Americans are more moderate than either party is. 
I think common ground can be found actually on issues such as clean energy. The people even in coal country would say, “You see that sawed off mountain up there? I think we ought to have a solar array up there or a windmill up there.” And Biden, paradoxically, has through the Inflation Reduction Act given billions of dollars, 80% of it to red states. This man who thinks God sent Donald Trump is against Trump on this issue. He says (renewable energy) can be a basis of economic growth. There could be crossovers. We’re never going to agree totally. 
David Goodman  
You have been clear that Democrats bear a lot of responsibility for the fact that their popularity is now hovering around 25 to 30%. What have Democrats done wrong? What should they do to right the ship? 
Arlie Hochschild  
The Democratic Party is more than a little the author of its own defeat here. I think it has closed the door to the white working class. And that’s a huge mistake and big problem. We used to have labor unions 30-40 years ago that were the middleman between the workers of both races and the Democratic Party. Now fewer than 9% of American workers are unionized. So that building block of the Democratic Party is gone. We’ve kind of disappeared into a variety of interest groups — women’s groups, African American groups, gay pride. We’re in pieces and we agree on a lot, but we haven’t got the leadership that we need to articulate that. There is a lot of great ferment and activism out there, groups like Indivisible, for example, but they’re not connected to the Democratic Party. 
The Democratic Party needs to eat some humble pie. Get some great leadership. There are great emerging leaders. I think I would even look at Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, a Republican state, who’s very popular. So surprises all out there.
David Goodman  
We began this with you saying that politics is really about narrative, and Trump had one that just resonated with more people. What would a new Democratic narrative sound like?
Arlie Hochschild  
It should begin with, Yes, a lot of us have suffered. The whole class system has gotten out of whack. The middle class has shrunk and a bunch of super rich have risen to the top and Trump is having us look the other way while that has happened. A lot of people are anxious that they’re falling down. So we need to say, Yes, there’s loss that you used to have something and now you don’t, because that’s the psychology that creates terrible anxiety. But nobody stole it from you, apart from the outsourcing large corporations that sought cheaper labor pools in Mexico and China. So if you want to blame someone, don’t blame your nearby migrant, but look at larger economic forces. And then say, don’t look around for the robber. Look around for the good people out there that see a problem and are rolling up their sleeves and in the American style fixing it, like the rescuers in Texas that are trying to get people out of harm’s way. Let’s not wait til there are more dead bodies. 
Let’s start with renewable energy, and let’s restore America through universities, our source of ultimate jobs and knowledge. They are a passport. Open the passport control to education. It’ll get you a job, and it’s gotten more expensive and out of reach. You need to extend curriculum so that you open the gates to the middle class. Base pride not on just being rich and having an enemy, but on being a giver. The translation of the word “pride” is to be able to help, to be of service, to make a difference for other people. I think we go back to that original concept of pride. Our narrative should be based on that, building instead of tearing down.
David Goodman  
You shared with me just how unsettling and scary this moment is. You spent your life in a university, and Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to higher education. Where do you find hope in this moment? What sustains you?
Arlie Hochschild  
Foremost, I have family and friends. But I also see a lot of great people who could make that alternate narrative come true. 
There are two stories out there. I know one person who says, Well this is getting so bad, I’m going to go to New Zealand. But there’s another person that I know who said, Look, I’ve been living in New Zealand, but the fight is on and I’m coming back. 
That’s the job ahead of us: to be fighters and creators of this new narrative.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Department of Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said Wednesday she’s buoyed by a vote from the state’s prison task force endorsing a $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Sioux Falls.
Whatever happens with a new prison, she said, the 144-year-old penitentiary it’s meant to replace should “never have another inmate in it.”
Speaking after a penitentiary tour for members of the media, Wasko said she’s hopeful the state can meet its correctional needs for the recommended dollar amount. 
Prison task force picks Sioux Falls, caps price at $650 million for 1,500 beds

The $650 million price point is about $75 million less than the state’s prison construction manager and prison design consultant said would be necessary to build 1,500 beds.
Wasko said she’s “optimistic” that the job can be done for less, but acknowledged “we are going to have to make some design changes.”
“We need this facility, and we want this facility, so we’re going to work to get to that $650 million budget,” Wasko said, while adding “we can’t slack” on safety features.
The Project Prison Reset task force made its recommendation Tuesday. Gov. Larry Rhoden created the group in February, after lawmakers failed to endorse a 1,500-bed, $825 million prison in Lincoln County. The task force’s missions were to decide if South Dakota needs a prison or prisons, then to decide how large and where to build.
The group will present its suggestions to the Legislature during a special session. Rhoden opted to push back the initial July date of that session, but has yet to pick a new date.
The state already has $566 million set aside in an incarceration construction fund, including about $50 million earmarked for a women’s prison in Rapid City, which is currently under construction.
Should lawmakers approve a prison on one of two undeveloped industrial sites in northeastern Sioux Falls, Wasko said the state penitentiary could make a great museum, or perhaps a training center for law enforcement tactical teams. She called herself “an architecture geek of prisons” who wouldn’t want to see the building demolished. Parts of the complex are made of Sioux quartzite, similar to other historic buildings in downtown Sioux Falls.
“I just like seeing these big, beautiful prisons that were built back then,” she said. “I just don’t like seeing people housed in them.”

(Photo from Michele Rayner's X account)After denying entry to Democratic lawmakers last week, the Florida Division of Emergency Management is scheduling a tour of the Everglades immigrant detention center for state legislators and Congress members on Saturday.
The decision followed new reporting about poor conditions for those detained at the facility.
Lawmakers will be allowed entrance from 11 am to 12:30 pm. on Saturday, according to an email sent out by FDEM legislative affairs director Meigs Lamb.
  Anna Eskamani via Florida House.
Orlando-area Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani was one of five state legislative Democrats denied entrance to the facility last week. In a statement, she said she was glad to see public pressure force the state of Florida to open its doors for a scheduled tour of the Everglades Detention Center.
“But let’s be clear: This isn’t a field trip — it’s oversight,” she wrote. “The law grants us the right to enter these facilities unannounced, at any time. A scheduled 90-minute tour is not a substitute for lawful access and long-term legislative accountability. What FDEM is offering doesn’t undo their illegal denial or fulfill their legal obligation to us, members of the Florida Legislature. Floridians deserve genuine transparency, not curated photo opportunities, and we will continue to push for that type of unfettered access.”
State Sens. Carlos Guillermo Smith and Shevin Jones, and Reps. Angie Nixon and Michele Rayner, were also among the Democrats denied entry Thursday. They were told at the time that their entrance was being denied  “due to safety concerns.”
“They claimed it wasn’t safe for us to enter unannounced but those same ‘safety concerns’ didn’t extend to those detained onsite or the president who toured two days prior,” Jones said in a written statement.
“Clearly, the state is trying to hide what is happening behind closed doors. I plan to join this weekend’s tour though fully expect it will be a sanitized version that suits the administration’s political objectives.”
The Democrats cited state statutes that allow them to inspect prisons and detention facilities.
However, on Monday night, a spokesperson for the FDEM said in a statement that another state statute grants inspection authority only to legislative committees, “not to individual legislators engaging in political theater. This distinction is crucial for ensuring that oversight is conducted through formal, established legislative processes.”
FDEM also said that while Florida statute 944.23 does authorize members of the Legislature to visit state correctional institutions, they have to be those under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections.
“The Alligator Alcatraz facility is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and does not otherwise fall within the statutory definition of a ‘state correctional institution,'” said FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman, referring to the appellation given the facility by state leaders.
Poor conditions alleged
In recent days, there have been media reports about poor conditions at the 3,000 person-capacity tent and trailer detention center in the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Multiple detainees told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they had gone days without showering, the toilets didn’t flush, and temperatures fluctuated between extremes.
Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier on Tuesday to let the county, which owns the land where the detention center is located, have remote video access, schedule visits, and receive weekly site reports.
Jeremy Redfern, communications director for Attorney General James Uthmeier, denied the request. He called the reporting about poor conditions at “Alligator Alcatraz” “fake news” on X.
Not everyone is buying that accusation.
Miami-Dade Republican state Sen. Ileana Garcia told the Phoenix that she will attend on Saturday, saying, “I’ve come across some complaints in the media that I’d like to investigate myself.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A report released Wednesday from the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter calls for conservation connectivity efforts throughout the state, and its budgets, to protect wildlife species. 
According to the report, habitat fragmentation, caused by the loss of habitat connectivity, is one of the “main reasons” for the loss of wildlife species in the state, as it reduced gene flow and therefore genetic diversity of wild species. 
Gene flow is the movement of genetic material from one population species to another. This transfer of genetic material creates more diverse genetics in a species, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported is “critical” for wildlife populations to survive.

The report outlines that prior to European settlement, Iowa’s land was mostly prairies, wetlands and forests, which “were plowed up, drained, and cut down to make room for growing crops and livestock.” 
In a press conference Wednesday about the report, Drake University ecology and botany professor Thomas Rosburg said there has been a  “tremendous loss” in habitat for wildlife across Iowa that has resulted in “fragments” of native ecosystem that are “not the same quality.” 
Roads, urban sprawl and acres of monoculture crops are the primary contributors to fragmentation. 
“Agriculture has created a landscape that’s extremely species poor, which is the opposite, total opposite of native systems,” Rosburg said. “This loss of biodiversity is very crucial, because, again, it’s the biodiversity, it’s the species themselves and their interactions that provides ecosystem services to us.” 
As an example, Rosburg said the fragmentation of native ecosystems makes it “very hard” for plants, which “don’t move around,” to reproduce. Rosburg said it’s more difficult for plants to attract pollinators and for pollinators to find plants and pass genetic material around in a fragmented system. 
The lack of genetic diversity means plants, and other species, are less able to adapt to their environments, which Rosburg said can contribute to extinction. 
According to the report, Iowa has lost 99.9% of its prairies, 98% of its wetlands, 80% of its woodlands and more than 100 wildlife species since European settlement in the 1800s. 
A significant number of plants and animals remain endangered or threatened in the state.
Connecting the areas of wildlife habitat is one way, according to the report, to help reverse this trend in Iowa wildlife species.
“Iowa public land will never be sufficient for the conservation of native biodiversity,” Rosburg said. “We don’t have nearly enough public land, so it’s critical that we develop public and private partnerships, conservation partnerships, in order to again achieve a better landscape.” 
Increasing conservation connectivity to fix ecosystem fragmentation
The report points to states like Florida, California and others that have passed legislation to protect habitat or establish wildlife corridors throughout the state. 
Wildlife corridors, as defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are pieces of “undeveloped land connecting two habitats so wildlife can move safely between them.” 
Sometimes these corridors are complex structures, like a natural overpass or underpass allowing wildlife to cross highways, but a corridor can also be something less engineered, like the addition of native plants along a roadway or on the edge of a field.
These corridors greatly extend the space a species has, and their ability to move between the natural spaces preserved in state parks and reserves. 
Another researcher on the call, Dave Hoferer, who instructs at Briar Cliff University in Sioux City, said wildlife corridors are an “obvious” way to help reverse the declining numbers of many vertebrate species. 
Hoferer said, for example, juvenile mammals typically stray from where they were born to reduce inbreeding, but when the landscape is fragmented, that becomes difficult to do. 
A corridor would provide these critters the shelter and food they needed to travel to a new “core” habitat, maybe in a different state park or reserve, where they would then mate and produce new members of their species. 
“Without these corridors, it becomes much more difficult for these organisms to move around the environment,” Hoferer said. 
Some corridor solutions are already in the works in Iowa, but the report says they need more support. 
Iowa’s Resource Enhancement and Protection, or REAP, program allocates funding for the acquisition of open spaces, wildlife enhancement, county conservation boards and the living roadway program.
The living roadway trust fund is managed by the Iowa Department of Transportation and puts native plants along roads in the state. According to its website, the fund has awarded more than $17 million for around 1,500 projects in the state. Part of the projects include seeding more than 16,000 acres of county roadside rights of way.
Rosburg said these aren’t perfect habitats, but they provide some shelter and food for animals and serve as corridors for plant species. 
Rosburg said programs like this, and other taxpayer-supported programs are necessary to “engage” private landowners in the issue. 
“It’s voters, and it’s people and it’s society, saying that this is important, and the willingness to put money into it, because it’s going to take money,” Rosburg said.
The report, and other environmental groups in the state, advocate for the legislature to fund the REAP program at its full appropriation of $20 million. This year the Legislature extended the program through 2026 and allocated $12 million to the program. 
Pam Mackey Taylor, the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter director and lobbyist, said this budget is “significantly underfunding the projects that could be used for wildlife corridors and habitat enhancements.” 
Another potential funding source is the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund,which more than 60% of Iowa voters chose to establish in 2010. The fund would use a three-eighths of cent sales tax to fund the enhancement of natural spaces like state parks, trails and wild habitat. 
The sales tax increase, however, has never been initiated, so the fund has sat empty, though it is a regular target for legislation that opposes the Department of Natural Resources’ acquisition of land. 
Macky Taylor said “it’s now time to fund the sales tax” and urged Iowans to speak up in favor of the fund, which she said would also help build conservation connectivity.
“It’s up to the Legislature to implement these programs,” Mackey Taylor said. “But if we put a mind to it and an effort into it, we can improve the habitat, restore things that need to be restored, and make the corridors that will help our plants and animals continue to survive in Iowa.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderThe Trump administration is preparing to expand travel restrictions to 36 additional countries — primarily those in Africa and the Caribbean — in a move purportedly aimed at boosting national security. According to a memo issued to U.S. diplomats and obtained by the Washington Post, the countries selected have a 60-day deadline to conform with certain requirements set by the State Department.
Travel bans were a defining feature of Trump’s first presidential term, when he issued executive orders blocking residents of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. So far in his second term, he has issued an executive order fully or partially restricting travelers from 19 countries. Travel restrictions on the 36 additional countries could go into effect as soon as August, NPR reported.
But imposing travel restrictions amid the ongoing FIFA World Cup — which is holding eight matches in Atlanta this year — has prompted pushback from Georgia’s Africa legislative caucus, which criticized the U.S.’s response in the face of ongoing humanitarian crises in many of the countries on the list. The caucus also argued that implementing the ban will cause Georgia to miss out on the economic benefits of hosting an international sporting event.
Of the 36 countries that are being considered for travel restrictions, 25 are located in Africa, and an additional four are in the Caribbean. However, Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the U. S. Department of State, refuted claims that majority non-white countries were being targeted for travel bans.
“The geoposition — the actual location of a country — is not a factor, or what continent that country is on,” Bruce told reporters during a June press briefing. “These are about very specific aspects about whether or not the United States feels it can trust the information we rely on those countries for to determine whether or not they’ll get a visa.”
State Rep. El-Mahdi Holly, a Stockbridge Democrat and co-chair of the Georgia Africa Legislative Caucus, argued that imposing more travel restrictions could damage diplomatic relationships and send the wrong message about America’s values as a country.
Immigrants from African and Caribbean countries “are valuable as entrepreneurs, educators, health care and service industry workers, tech pioneers, legal minds and medical minds, pastors, aggregate and agricultural professionals, who all play a very integral part in shaping our nation’s economy,” Holly said. 
“When we allow a blanket, broad brushed characterization of labeling them as criminals or as threats, we undermine the time-honored principles of justice and fairness upon which our nation stands,” he said.

The caucus said it sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asking him not to implement the ban. Caucus members also urged Georgia residents to contact Georgia’s senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, to speak out against additional travel restrictions.
“Let’s remember what democracy stands for: Freedom of movement, exchange of ideas, culture and opportunity,” said state Rep. Segun Adeyina, a Grayson Democrat and member of Georgia’s Africa Legislative Caucus. “This ban undermines those values. It sends a message that Black nations and Black people aren’t welcome in the United States of America. We reject this message. We stand for fairness, for families, for commerce and for democracy, and we call on this administration to do the same.”
The countries that are being considered for a travel ban are Angola; Antigua and Barbuda; Benin; Bhutan; Burkina Faso; Cabo Verde; Cambodia; Cameroon; Democratic Republic of Congo; Djibouti; Dominica; Ethiopia; Egypt; Gabon; Gambia; Ghana; Ivory Coast; Kyrgyzstan; Liberia; Malawi; Mauritania; Niger; Nigeria; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Sao Tome and Principe; Senegal; South Sudan; Syria; Tanzania; Tonga; Tuvalu; Uganda; Vanuatu; Zambia; and Zimbabwe.

(Photo by Christopher Smith for KFF Health News)Four years before Kimberly Gallagher enrolled in Medicaid herself, the public health insurance program’s rules prompted her to make an excruciating choice — to give up guardianship of her son so she could work as his caregiver.
Now, another proposed twist in the rules could mean that, even though Missouri pays her to do that work, she might still have to prove to the state that she’s not unemployed.
The Kansas City, Missouri, resident has cared for her disabled son, Daniel, for all 31 years of his life. A rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome, in addition to autism, left him with an intellectual disability; a constant, excessive hunger; and an inability to speak. His needs left Gallagher, an elementary school teacher by training, with little opportunity to work outside her home.
As congressional Republicans slash about $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending, Gallagher is among the 18.5 million Americans who could be required to prove that they work enough to keep their health insurance.
A budget bill that passed the House and Senate would require 80 hours of work or community service a month for adults who are insured through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion program, which has allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults with low incomes. Forty states, plus Washington, D.C., have expanded their programs, additions that now cover about 20 million Americans, including Gallagher.
She enrolled in the coverage in December 2023, after she could no longer afford her private insurance. Before her husband died of cancer in 2019, the couple paid for private insurance and supported themselves on the income he earned as a master watchmaker. After his death, Gallagher was left to earn a living and find insurance on her own. At 59, she’s too young to collect her husband’s Social Security survivor benefit.

	The Medicaid program that pays for in-home care for Daniel and 8,000 other Missourians with disabilities allows family members to be compensated for caregiving, but only if they’re not the legal guardian of the person they care for. So, Gallagher went to court to give up her rights to make decisions for her son and transfer authority to her parents.
“I think it’s appalling that it’s required, but it was necessary,” she said. “There was no way I could work outside of taking care of Daniel.”
Republicans have touted Medicaid work requirements both as a way to reduce federal spending on the program and as a moral imperative for Americans.
“Go out there. Do entry-level jobs. Get into the workforce. Prove that you matter. Get agency into your own life,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a recent interview on Fox Business.
Democrats, meanwhile, have cast the requirements as bureaucratic red tape that won’t meaningfully increase employment but will cause eligible people to lose their health insurance because of administrative hurdles.
Indeed, the vast majority of Americans enrolled in Medicaid expansion are already working, caregiving, attending school, or have a disability, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
And while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement included in the House bill would cause 4.8 million Americans to lose their insurance, only about 300,000 of those people are unemployed because of lack of interest in working, according to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group. Recent history in states that have tried work requirements suggests technical and paperwork problems have caused a substantial portion of coverage losses.
Still, the provisions are generally popular among Republican lawmakers and the public. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has repeatedly cautioned against cutting people off from Medicaid, has signaled support for adding work requirements.
And 68% of Americans favor the requirement described in the House bill, according to a recent poll conducted by KFF. But support for work requirements dropped as low as 35% when respondents learned that most Medicaid recipients already work and could lose their coverage because of paperwork requirements.
That’s what happened in Arkansas, where 18,000 people lost their Medicaid coverage in 2018 after the state phased in a work requirement. Thousands more were on pace to lose coverage in 2019 before a federal judge halted the requirement, largely over concerns about coverage losses. In discussions with focus groups, KFF found that many Arkansas Medicaid participants did not fully understand the requirements, despite the state’s outreach efforts, and some people didn’t receive mailed notices. Others were confused because the work-reporting paperwork and separate forms to renew Medicaid coverage asked for similar information.
Many family caregivers would be exempt from the work requirements proposed in Congress, but Gallagher probably would not, since she had to relinquish guardianship of her son to be paid for the work. While the hours she already logs should be enough to satisfy the requirement, she’ll need to report them again — unless the state can identify her through its existing data. But Missouri has a history of procedural problems in the state agency that administers Medicaid.

	In early 2022, for example, Missouri was taking more than 100 days on average to process applications for Medicaid expansion, a wait that prompted patients to put off needed care and was more than twice the processing time allowed by federal law.
And 79% of the more than 378,000 Missourians who lost Medicaid coverage when covid-era enrollment protections ended in 2023 did so because of procedural reasons.
The next year, a federal judge ruled that Missourians were illegally being denied food aid by the state, in part because insufficient staffing at call centers left eligible people without assistance.
“They’re historically understaffed,” Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the state agency that administers Medicaid and food assistance. “I think that’s really the underlying problem.”
McBride’s analysis of Missouri’s Medicaid recipients found that fewer than 45,000 of the people enrolled in expansion in 2023 were unemployed for reasons other than caregiving, disability, attending school, or retirement. But more than twice that many Missourians could lose their insurance if work requirements prompt disenrollment rates similar to Arkansas’ implementation, according to a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes government policies.
The estimate assumes many otherwise eligible people would still lose coverage as a result of falling through the cracks, McBride said.
Hawley, who backed the Senate bill, declined to comment for this article. The senator previously told reporters that “we can sort that out” when asked about eligible people inadvertently losing Medicaid because of work requirements.

	Gallagher worries about her coverage, because she recently was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland. She said she had to search for her Medicaid card to fill the prescription that followed, having barely used it in the year in a half she’s been covered.
She also worries about her son’s Medicaid. A nursing home is not a realistic option, considering his needs. His coverage doubles as Gallagher’s only source of income and also pays for other caregivers, when she can find them, who give her breaks to tend to her own health and to her aging parents.
But nearly all in-home services like those Daniel receives are optional programs that states are not required to include in their Medicaid programs. And the magnitude of the cuts being proposed have prompted fears that the optional programs could be chopped.
“It would destroy our lives,” Gallagher said. “The only income we would have would be Daniel’s Social Security.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A mandate that all Oklahoma public schools offer cost-free cafeteria meals is “nothing more than an empty threat,” a House Republican leader said.
The head of the House Common Education Committee, Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, said Wednesday there is no legal basis for the edict state Superintendent Ryan Walters issued this week. Ordering all districts to pay for free meals would overstep the powers of Walters’ office and infringe on local school boards’ authority, said Lowe, a former agriculture teacher.
“Addressing student hunger and streamlining administrative costs are both worthwhile endeavors, but these changes must be implemented legislatively, not through an unfunded mandate,” Lowe said.
Walters, a fellow Republican, contended that public schools have enough state and federal funds to afford universal free meals for students. He urged districts to cut back on administrator salaries to make room in their budgets to implement the mandate in the 2025-26 school year. Doing so, he said, will ensure every student receives full educational opportunities.

“This isn’t negotiable,” Walters said on Monday. “Bureaucrats who can’t prioritize students over their own perks will be shown the door.”
Districts are legally obligated to submit their annual budget plans no later than Oct. 1 to the Oklahoma State Board of Education, which approves accreditation ratings for every school in the state. A public school cannot operate in the state without accreditation from the board.
Walters said he would pursue penalties against districts that don’t comply with his order, including a potential accreditation downgrade, withholding of state funds and a financial audit. He said he would consider revoking the certification of any educator who fails or refuses to incorporate no-cost meals into their budgets.
Oklahoma law doesn’t require schools to provide free meals to all students, though some already do so voluntarily, Lowe said. He also noted there’s no state law enabling Walters to retaliate against districts for not offering breakfasts and lunches for free.
“If Walters has legislative goals, I encourage him to be communicative with lawmakers year-round, not after session has adjourned and it’s too late for the Legislature to consider any of his proposals,” Lowe said.

The chairmen of the Senate Education Committee and the House education appropriations subcommittee did not return requests for comment.
Some House Democrats gave mixed reviews of Walters’ order. Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, echoed Lowe’s sentiment that the edict is an “unfunded mandate.”
Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, and Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, celebrated Walters joining a cause their party has been pushing for. At least nine, mostly Democratic-led, states have implemented universal free meals in public schools, including neighboring Colorado and New Mexico.
Waldron, now the chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party, said he supports free meals in schools as long as they don’t negatively impact districts.
Some school leaders have said they would have to implement drastic cuts to afford Walters’ order. Other districts, like Tulsa and Oklahoma City, already offer free food service to all students through a federal reimbursement program targeted at high-poverty schools.
“We hope there will be an opportunity to work on this collaboratively, without disruption to local school finances so that every child has a chance to succeed,” Waldron said in a statement Monday.

June 7, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingState regulators may decide as soon as Thursday if an electric transmission line project, placing many miles of service wires across Michigan, can move forward – a decision that could leave farmers and property owners in the project path with few options to halt the expansion.
Meanwhile, an attorney representing some of those landowners has been actively advising them to not sign what he called bad deals conveying property rights to the company involved.
The reality facing property owners in the project path is that there are few avenues in statute and in state court to stop ITC Holding Corp., doing business as Michigan Electric Transmission Company, from building two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and another stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County.
That rings especially true if the Michigan Public Service Commission grants the company certificates to begin work on the project, which could happen at its next meeting on Thursday afternoon.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
An agenda for the Thursday commission meeting was not yet published as of Wednesday afternoon, but the commission said at its June meeting that a decision could happen soon. Commissioners on June 12 sought additional information on the impacts of the proposed routes and tabled a decision on the project to a later date.
If the project is approved, that means landowners may have just a few clear options – fight the company in court through eminent domain proceedings or sign agreements with the company giving up portions of their land.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, attorney Stephon Bagne, of the Clark Hill law firm, said he was actively working with clients in the project path to help them understand their rights and to help them receive just compensation for their land. He also plans to represent them in court when the company ultimately sues landowners to gain access to their land via eminent domain.
Bagne said he was also advising his clients not sign what he called slanted deals offered by the transmission company, which he said do not justly compensate landowners. Even if stopping the project wasn’t an option, fighting in court to receive better compensation options was at least advantageous and could mean greater rights and more bang for their buck in terms of what they might receive from the company.
“Once the Public Service Commission issues those certificates, METC will have the power to implement this project, and the court is not going to be able to stop it,” Bagne said.
Signing a land option with the company, he said, could make that situation worse for landowners.
“The current land acquisition efforts are exceptionally slanted in their favor,” Bagne said of the transmission company’s offers to landowners. “[My work] has been about educating property owners that these are terrible deals and they should not be signing them.”
Bagne said those option agreements, if signed, allow the company to acquire property rights that they would otherwise need to purchase through eminent domain proceedings. The offers he’s seen put forward to his clients are based on a percentage of the area that will be physically encumbered by the proposed rights of way.
“Just compensation requires you to consider the impacts on the larger property, and it requires you to assume that METC will use all the rights they’re acquiring to the fullest extent allowed by law,” Bagne said. “So if you have a farm that is being bifurcated by a wide right of way, the impacts are going to be felt outside the area of the easement.”
Bagne said a good example is if a property has drain tiles or an irrigation system, and those systems become interrupted, that impact will be experienced outside of the granted right of way.
“It will either constitute costs that the property owners are going to need to expend, which is compensable, or it is going to devalue their property outside of the easement area,” Bagne said.
A message seeking comment from Michigan Electric Transmission Company was not immediately returned.
The option agreements could also allow the company to use the entire property as a construction staging area and a temporary workspace, but if property owners hold out and force the firm to purchase the land via eminent domain, the company will have to use a defined, limited space while the project unfolds, Bagne said.
“They’re also going to have to provide compensation for the use of that area,” Bagne said of the eminent domain route. “If you have an 80-acre farm field that is having five acres encumbered by the right of way, the current option agreements that METC is seeking would allow the rest of the 75 acres to be used as a construction staging ground. … They’re not offering to pay anything for that.”
Bagne also noted that there was no language in the options being offered to landowners to address environmental concerns like soil mixing, which is something he hopes the Public Service Commission will address before approving the project.
Another concern around signing agreements with the company before the commission issues its decision, Bagne said, was that the option terms are rather broad and allow the firm to exercise future property rights outside the scope of what’s before the commission.
A single 345 kilovolt transmission is currently part of the project’s scope, but signing one of the company’s option agreements means it could come in later and increase the voltage, add bigger towers and more lines without property owners being compensated for that.
Although the farmers and landowners’ default position has been that they do not want the project to go forward, Bagne said making the company seek the land through eminent domain would at least allow them to preserve their rights.
Still, Bagne said none of his clients want to see their land seized, as some of the properties are bicentennial farms.
“Farmers … are people who are most conscious about passing the land for their next generation and generations after,” Bagne said. “And when they see not just a damage to the property in terms of its value, but their ability to pass along a career to their kids or grandchildren, they care very much about this. … They have a connection to this land that is very deep, and they don’t want to see it being destroyed by a project like this.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9052-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Getty Images)A rural central Washington hospital is warning of devastating consequences from the Medicaid cuts the Republican-led Congress passed last week. 
For years, Astria Health has worked to find a path forward for its hospital in Toppenish on the Yakama Reservation. But the drastic downsizing of federal Medicaid funding threatens the hospital’s future, which could force it to change services, consolidate with Astria’s hospital about 20 miles away in Sunnyside or explore an acquisition or merger.
If the Toppenish hospital closes, the communities it serves would become a medical desert, hospital officials caution.
“We have stretched resources as far as they can go,” Astria President and CEO Brian Gibbons said in a statement. “But no health system — especially one serving multiple underserved communities — can continue reallocating funds without consequences.”
The hospital’s plight is emblematic of how huge cuts to Medicaid included in the megabill President Donald Trump signed Friday could prove ruinous for the finances of both the state and its hospitals, especially in rural areas, as well as for the low-income residents who rely on the program for health care coverage, advocates say. 
The so-called “big, beautiful bill” is expected to blow a multibillion-dollar hole into the state’s budget, and kick hundreds of thousands of residents off their insurance if they don’t prove they meet new requirements.
As of May, nearly 2 million Washington residents, including over 850,000 children, were enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health, according to the state Health Care Authority. That’s roughly a quarter of the state’s population.
Given the size of the program and its heavy imprint on hospitals’ finances, the fallout of federal cuts could be felt far beyond just Medicaid patients. Hospitals may have to grapple with decisions to close units or entire facilities to all patients.
“It’s difficult to overstate how devastating these cuts will be to Washingtonians,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a press conference Wednesday. “They will bring our health care system to the brink and harm people in every corner of our state.”
No congressional Democrats supported the tax cut and spending bill. In Washington, both Republican members of the congressional delegation voted for it, despite their central and eastern Washington districts having the most residents on Medicaid. 
Republicans see the move as rooting out fraud, waste and abuse in the safety net program. U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, called the changes “common-sense reforms” to “ensure the program’s long-term sustainability.” Reduced Medicaid spending is one of the main ways GOP lawmakers attempted to offset the expense of tax cuts in their legislation.
Over the next 10 years, Washington could lose one-fifth of the federal dollars it receives to run Apple Health, amounting to $3 billion to $5 billion per year, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF. Washington spends $21 billion on Medicaid annually, with $13 billion of that coming from the feds. It’s the biggest chunk of federal funding the state receives and Medicaid is one of the state’s largest expenses. 
Ferguson has said previously there’s no way for the state to backfill the lost federal funding using rainy day fund reserves.
The uninsured rate in Washington was 4.8% as of 2023. For years, the state made progress getting more people health insurance. Ferguson now expects the uninsured figure to balloon into double digits due to the Republican legislation.
Medicaid is especially vital for many of Washington’s most vulnerable residents. It’s the largest payer for opioid use disorder treatment. More than 100,000 use it for long-term care. It covers three in eight people with disabilities and three in five nursing home residents.
Cathy Knight, state director of the Washington Association of Area Agencies on Aging, worries the funding loss could lead states to restrict Medicaid eligibility. 
“The ripple effect is going to be disastrous in the years to come,” she said. “I think people are going to die.”
Medicaid enrollees account for 45% of births in the state, and 70% in rural Washington, the governor said.
“Cuts to Medicaid will absolutely impact rural hospitals first and the quickest, because they live on such thin margins, and you change their reimbursement a little bit, and you’re going to start to see those shutter,” said Harborview Medical Center CEO Sommer Kleweno Walley, who was born in a hospital in Whitman County. 
“And when they do, that will shutter for everybody in the rural community, not just individuals who require Medicaid,” she added.
Lost coverage
Before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Emily Brice was working in social services. 
Over and over, uninsured people with serious illnesses would come to her asking if they had any options to get coverage.
“My answer to that was, many times, ‘I don’t have an answer for you,’” Brice recalled Tuesday, feeling like she was sending them home to die.
This was in Chicago, before she became a lawyer and co-executive director at Northwest Health Law Advocates.
“I didn’t want to give people that answer anymore,” Brice said. “When I look at this bill, I see echoes of that past where we had decided as a society at the time that health care was not something that everybody deserves to have.”
Overall, the law is expected to cut about $1 trillion of federal Medicaid spending nationwide over 10 years. Much of this reduction is tied to stricter work requirements that are expected to push people off the program.
Medicaid spending in rural areas, specifically, is estimated to drop by $155 billion over the next decade, including $4.75 billion in Washington, according to KFF. To address this, lawmakers in Congress added $50 billion in grants for rural health care. 
Newhouse and Rep. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, both applauded the investment, though it’s unclear how much of that will end up helping Washington.
The cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace could leave nearly 12 million people without insurance by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Estimates of how many people could become uninsured in Washington vary. According to Ferguson’s office, 250,000 would stand to lose Medicaid coverage and another 150,000 wouldn’t be able to afford insurance on the health care exchange. Congressional Democrats peg the total around 329,000. 
This is achieved through a number of major but wonky changes to federal health policy. Brice calls it “death by a thousand paper cuts.”
On the enrollment side, the biggest change is the work requirements. Starting as soon as January 2027, enrollees will consistently have to prove they’re working, volunteering or attending classes at least 80 hours per month or show they qualify for an exemption. The mandate would apply to healthy adults up to age 64 without dependent children under 13 years old.
States have experimented with work requirements, but have run into administrative roadblocks and added costs. In Arkansas, the requirements didn’t increase employment but did result in people losing Medicaid coverage. 
“Think about how hard it is to file taxes, and then just imagine doing that process multiple times a year just to see a doctor or get your prescription,” Brice said.
Of Washington adults on Medicaid, 70% are working, according to KFF.

The provision targets states like Washington that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. It doesn’t apply to the mostly Republican-led states that haven’t done so. The Medicaid expansion is one of the most significant legacies of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a law that has drawn the scorn of Republicans for years and which they attempted to repeal during Trump’s first term.
Carma Matti-Jackson, president and CEO of the Washington Health Care Association, said that even though older Americans aren’t covered by the work requirements, they could face trickle-down effects if states divert funding to assist people who’ve lost coverage. 
Added costs
Some who continue to receive Medicaid coverage will pay more out of pocket. 
The new law requires expansion states like Washington to charge up to $35 for some services for certain enrollees. Those whose incomes are between the federal poverty level and 138% of that level will have to pay. For a single person, the poverty level is $15,650 per year. 
The new copay policy doesn’t apply to primary care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, emergency care in an emergency room or family planning.
This could lead to low-income enrollees forgoing care to avoid paying even modest amounts. However, states can choose to charge less than $35. While many states have already imposed some level of cost sharing, Washington has not.
Justin Gill, the president of the Washington State Nurses Association, expects to see more uninsured and sicker patients who’ll further strain an already overstretched workforce. 
“We’re going to try and do the best that we can, but when the systems around us are working against us, at some point, you’re going to see providers, nurses really kind of start to identify that this may not be something that’s sustainable for them individually,” he said. “And I think that that’s a realistic threat that oftentimes people won’t really appreciate until we get there.”
Gill, an urgent care nurse practitioner in Everett, is frustrated with lawmakers who voted for the legislation but won’t have to sit in the exam room when a patient comes in with a heart attack that could’ve been prevented with primary care visits.
And if hospitals become more jammed, that means worse care for everyone, Matti-Jackson said. 
“So when my grandmother, who’s in assisted living, falls and breaks her hip, or has a stroke and needs to get in, there’s access issues,” she said. 
Finances and Obamacare
The legislation also limits taxes on health care providers that help underpin state Medicaid spending. Revenue from these taxes is used to unlock more federal dollars and the money ends up flowing back to the providers. 
Washington levies such taxes on hospitals, nursing homes and ambulance providers. This change could especially hurt rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid spending to keep above water.
The bill also reduces what are called state-directed payments, which allow states to tell managed care plans, with federal approval, how much they should pay providers. The goal is to get hospital systems more money for taking care of Medicaid patients.
“Let’s pretend like you were going to get $50 to take care of this patient,” explained Kleweno Walley, the Harborview CEO. “With this program, you would get $60 now. That’s not necessarily anywhere near what a commercial insurance would pay, but at least it’s more than what the base Medicaid payment was.”
These state-directed payments and provider taxes bring in nearly $2.4 billion annually in Washington, according to state health officials. Critics liken these financing mechanisms to money laundering.
Those with Obamacare plans will also face new barriers to enrolling and won’t be allowed to automatically reenroll. 
This will impact young healthy people who won’t be bothered to jump through more hoops to get insurance, Brice said.
The law also restricts subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage for some lawfully present immigrants, like asylum seekers and refugees. Earlier versions of the legislation aimed to lower Medicaid payments to states like Washington that cover immigrants without legal status using state dollars, but that provision didn’t win final approval.
UW Medicine estimates it’ll lose $365 million per year because of the law, said Kleweno Walley, whose hospital in Seattle is part of the University of Washington system. But that’s “just the icing on top,” she said, as hundreds of millions more in hospital funding could be at risk depending on how many people lose insurance coverage.
She worries the long lead time for some of the provisions to kick in will make it harder for the public to understand the legislation’s impact. 
“My fear is that people will forget,” Kleweno Walley said, “and then it’ll slowly trickle out and cause ripple effects.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)The newly formed joint commission tasked with overseeing Virginia’s transition to a legal retail cannabis market held its inaugural meeting in Richmond Wednesday, launching what lawmakers described as the next chapter in the commonwealth’s winding path toward a regulated marijuana industry.
Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the House resolution creating the commission earlier this year, was elected chair during the meeting at the state Capitol. While no other formal action was taken, the panel laid out its mission and signaled it would use previously vetoed legislation as a foundation to craft a new proposal for 2026 — when Virginia will have a new governor.
“Our goal is to create a successful approach to cannabis that’s rooted in protecting the public, the principles of restorative justice, economic equity and public health,” Krizek said in his opening remarks. 
“The need is to regulate, control, and tax marijuana, to generate significant revenue dedicated to community reinvestment, create hundreds of new, small local businesses, strengthen Virginia’s vital agricultural sector, and end the racially disparate impacts of prohibition.”
The commission, which was established through House Joint Resolution 497 without needing the governor’s signature, is set to operate through July 1, 2028. It will serve as a forum for public engagement and legislative planning, aiming to build consensus on cannabis policy amid shifting political dynamics in the state.
Krizek noted that although the effort to legalize retail cannabis has faced repeated setbacks — most notably from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes — the groundwork is already in place.
“We’ve already been pretty successful,” he said. “We’ve made some big progress, and this will be the final capstone on that progress.”
 A blueprint already written

In March, Youngkin vetoed House Bill 2485 — legislation sponsored by Krizek and backed by lawmakers from both parties that would have established the framework for a licensed and taxed cannabis market. The identical Senate version, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, passed with bipartisan support as well.
The legislation would have authorized adult-use retail sales starting May 1, 2026, with licenses for cultivation, processing, testing, and retail set to be issued as early as September 2025. It included a microbusiness license tier aimed at lowering entry barriers for historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs and implemented a seed-to-sale tracking system to monitor all commercial activity.
Youngkin’s vetoes take another hit on cannabis reform in Virginia

A projected $87.8 million in annual tax revenue by 2031 was to be allocated across public priorities: 40% for early childhood education, 30% for equity reinvestment, 25% for substance use treatment and 5% for public health.
But Youngkin rejected the measure, saying it would endanger public safety and contribute to negative social outcomes, including “increased gang activity,” impaired road safety, and “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health.” He argued the bill would not eliminate illegal sales or guarantee product safety.
Youngkin also vetoed related bills, including proposals to expunge or reduce sentences for marijuana-related offenses, and a bill to prevent legal cannabis use from being used against parents in child custody cases. Reform advocates decried the vetoes as a continuation of policies that ignore the realities of marijuana use in Virginia.
 Legal, but still in the shadows

Virginia made headlines in 2021 as the first Southern state to legalize small-scale possession and home cultivation of cannabis. But despite legalization, no retail infrastructure was ever implemented, leaving the state in a legal limbo. Cannabis remains readily available — just not regulated, tested, or taxed.
“We know that marijuana is being sold in this commonwealth,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who helped legalize personal possession and now sits on the commission. “And thanks to Governor Youngkin’s veto pen, the way it’s being sold is with illegal, un-taxed enterprises outside of the medical program.”
Ebbin urged fellow commission members to keep the big picture in mind.
“My goal is to move sales away from the illegal market on the street corner to behind an age-verified counter with tested products, and I think that’s a goal that most of the members of this commission share,” he said.
 Voices from the public

During Wednesday’s meeting, advocates, growers, wellness professionals, and business leaders addressed the commission in a public comment session that highlighted the wide-ranging hopes — and frustrations — of those awaiting a regulated market.
Chelsea Higgs Wise, founder of Marijuana Justice, praised the commission for opening a space for dialogue but urged members to stay grounded in the equity framework laid out in the state’s original adult-use blueprint.
“The 2020 JLARC report was key to be lifted,” she said, referring to the legislative audit report that called for an equitable cannabis market. 
“From the public comments, it appears Virginians are unified on wanting broad inclusion within the market versus only benefiting a well-resourced few. There is still much work to be done and we are confident the commission will take this seriously,” she added.
Jason Blanchette, president of the Virginia Cannabis Association, pointed out that the core elements of the legislation have already passed twice — just not survived Youngkin’s vetoes.
“So obviously our hope in representing small Virginia businesses and small farmers … is that we can all come to an agreement at some point here, right?” he said.
That hope was echoed by Thelonius Cook, a farmer on the Eastern Shore and president of the Mid-Atlantic Black Farmers Caucus.
“I’m here to represent the voice of small farmers, and in particular, Black farmers,” Cook said. “Had it not been for the enslaved labor of Africans producing tobacco and the plantations of Virginia, this colony would have not survived, let alone went on to become America. We want to make sure we have an opportunity to participate in this agricultural revolution.”
Jabria Craft, a cannabis wellness coach from Richmond, spoke passionately about moving beyond product hype and fear-based regulation.
“My platform is rooted in helping people build sustainable and informed relationships with this plant,” she said. “Education is either nonexistent or filled with shame at risks, instead of benefits and support. I would like to see Virginia cannabis as an industry that’s centered in education, intention, and equity… and that us Black and brown and queer folks aren’t left behind on a system that was built on their backs.”
 A policy puzzle with political stakes

While Democrats are banking on winning back the governor’s mansion in November — with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger as their nominee — the cannabis debate remains far from settled. The commission’s task now is to rework and refine the blueprint for legislation that can be enacted under new leadership.
Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a local prosecutor and one of two House Republicans who supported Krizek’s retail bill earlier this year, has publicly advocated for a pragmatic approach to cannabis reform.
“I have been an advocate for common-sense legislation to regulate the adult cannabis market in Virginia,” Obenshain told The Mercury in March. 
“I’ll continue working in a bipartisan fashion until we find the right balance on legislation that can keep Virginians safe while also eliminating the confusing legal regime and proliferation of potentially dangerous products that currently exists.”
Yet Youngkin has remained firm in his opposition. His administration warned that legal cannabis use could harm children, deteriorate mental health outcomes, and worsen public safety — claims many advocates reject as overblown or unfounded.
One of the bills Youngkin vetoed, HB 2555 by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would have allowed incarcerated individuals with marijuana-related felonies before 2021 to seek sentence modifications. The governor said that could apply to people convicted of more serious drug offenses, including fentanyl trafficking, and impose “undue burdens” on courts and victims.
Another vetoed measure, HB 2613 by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, aimed to prevent courts from using legal cannabis consumption against parents in custody or visitation decisions. 
Youngkin argued the bill could “risk exposing children to harm.”
 The road ahead

As the commission begins its work, members say they will focus on listening to the public, gathering expert input and refining a proposal that can finally bring structure to Virginia’s cannabis landscape.
Krizek said public engagement would be a top priority in the first year. “The idea will be to craft the best bill possible to reintroduce next session,” he said. “So you know it’s a priority of mine.”
Though the governor’s mansion has served as a roadblock so far, Democrats hope the upcoming election — and a shift in executive leadership — will provide the opening they need to bring a legal retail cannabis system to fruition.
Until then, the panel has its work cut out for it. It is set to meet next on Aug. 20.

Kelly Ayotte vetoed a bill Tuesday that would allow school districts to choose to conduct partisan elections, arguing it would divide residents.
House Bill 356 would allow residents in school districts to vote to propose a warrant article to make school board elections partisan, meaning candidates would be identified by political party. That article would require a simple majority to adopt; eliminating it later would also require a simple majority.
The bill would also allow school board members in each party to caucus in private without being subjected to the state’s right-to-know law, which currently prevents board members from meeting in private without officially going into a nonpublic session. 
Rep. Robert Wherry, a Hudson Republican and the prime sponsor of the bill, argued a partisan ballot system would “provide additional information on the school district elections to the voters, which should increase voter awareness and voter turnout.”
But Ayotte disagreed. 
“Local school board elections are run properly and in a nonpartisan manner, and there is no need to fix a system that is not broken,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message Tuesday. “Making these local elections into partisan fights will create unnecessary division between Granite Staters.”
New Hampshire law currently allows partisan elections for town or city officials if voters pass a warrant article to do so. But observers say no towns have chosen to do so. 
The veto is Ayotte’s third since taking office. In June, she vetoed House Bill 319, which would remove the requirement for school districts to provide transportation for half-day kindergarten programs. And this month, she vetoed House Bill 781, a bill that would ban cell phones in K-12 schools. A different version of that legislation, which has been championed by Ayotte, passed into law as part of the budget trailer bill last month. 
Lawmakers will meet later this year for “Veto Day,” in which they will vote on whether to overturn Ayotte’s vetoes. They will need a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate to do so.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ayottebills-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

Glenn Ellington and Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid discussed the new case management order with reporters in Biedscheid's courtroom on July 9, 2025. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico’s highest court on Wednesday morning issued a new rule requiring criminal cases in three counties in Northern New Mexico to be resolved more quickly.
The rule comes at the request of judges in the First Judicial District Court, which covers Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties, who asked the New Mexico Supreme Court to adopt a special local rule called a “case management order.” The district’s time to resolve criminal cases is about 42% higher than the statewide average, according to an Administrative Office of the Courts news release.
The new rule requires most criminal cases — with the exception of ones with “unusually high complexity”— be resolved within seven to 10 months, and follows the deployment of the case management pilot program in several other judicial districts around the state.
Under the rule, whenever a grand jury indicts someone, or a judge finds probable cause that a particular defendant committed an alleged crime, the clock will start ticking for both prosecutors and defense attorneys to accomplish certain tasks by certain deadlines, First Judicial District Court Judge T. Glenn Ellington, one of three judges handling criminal cases in the district, told reporters on Wednesday. Ellington, who has been on the bench in the district since 1997, said “it’s just taking longer” to move through those cases than it has historically.
Between June 2023 and July 2024, criminal cases in the First Judicial District took an average of 327 days to finish, the slowest rate of any judicial district in New Mexico, according to data from the Administrative Office of the Courts. The Seventh Judicial District Court in central New Mexico, which had the second highest completion time, took 291 days on average.
Courts have already adopted similar deadlines in the Second Judicial District in New Mexico’s most populous county of Bernalillo; the Third Judicial District, in the second most populous county of Doña Ana; and the Eighth Judicial District, which covers Union, Colfax and Taos counties.
Prosecutors and lawmakers representing some of those areas asked state lawmakers last week to pressure the Supreme Court to either lift or change the rules, arguing that they do not have the resources needed to meet the deadlines. Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies predicted that if the rule comes to her district, “thousands of cases are going to be dismissed.”
Local prosecutors seek lawmakers’ help in lifting court deadlines

The rule allows for attorneys to ask for additional time in particular cases and for judges to grant extensions. 
Ellington said Wednesday the rule contains various sanctions and consequences for missing deadlines, including dismissed cases, ultimately. Prosecutors could still refile dismissed charges, depending on the circumstances, he said.
First Judicial District Court Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid said he’s heard complaints from prosecutors and public defenders that individual judges have very different scheduling rules from each other, and part of the case management order comes from a desire to address that concern.
Moreover, Biedscheid said the results from the districts already operating with the case management rule show the rules’ efficacy, and so he and the other judges asked the Supreme Court to bring it to their area. 
The rule includes three scheduling tracks, with the simplest cases going to trial within seven months; most other cases going to trial within 300 days or about 10 months; and cases with higher complexity, such as numerous witnesses or extensive scientific evidence, operating without time limits. 
Thus, Ellington said he does not expect most serious or complex cases, like homicide for example, to proceed more quickly.
He does, however, expect the new rule to result in faster resolutions in the simpler cases “that really fill up the dockets and add to the delay.” Those include fourth-degree felonies, usually involving nonviolent conduct or crimes against property; along with third- and second-degree felonies, such as drug possession with intent to distribute.
Biedscheid said judges like himself and others who handle civil cases, along with those who handle domestic violence cases, may be called upon to take additional criminal cases in order to share the workload.
“Criminal cases get priority, and they are in fact the most important cases that we have,” he said. “We might run into situations where there’s sort of a logjam. Judges that do not normally handle criminal cases — but are absolutely authorized and qualified to do that — may be jumping in to get those trials done.”
The justices ordered the local rule for Santa Fe to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026. It will only apply to cases filed after that date, Biedscheid said, and does not change any deadlines for existing cases.
Between now and then, the rule will be rolled out through an ongoing conversation between the judges, prosecutors, the state Department of Justice, the Law Offices of the Public Defender, private attorneys and police, Ellington said.
The roll-out date also provides additional time for law enforcement to prepare. Biedscheid said police made judges aware of the logistical challenges of turning over evidence to the state and the defense, and so the rule explicitly allows them to file reports and evidence electronically.
“If anything, this is giving them a lot of lead time if they need to change anything in how they operate to do that,” Ellington said.
Biedscheid said that while switching to the new rule has been hard on judges, police, prosecutors and defense attorneys in other districts, the time it has taken to resolve cases has improved since then.
“It has not been a seamless, perfect, fantasy situation,” Biedscheid said. “I will not be surprised if there are hiccups, some controversies, things like that, early on in this implementation.”

DNA testing confirmed the remains found in Marlborough, New Hampshire, about 50 years ago belong to Nancy Gale Erickson, a young nurse who lived in Vermont at the time of her disappearance.

After more than 50 years, investigators have identified a woman whose body was discovered in Marlborough, New Hampshire, back in 1974. The woman is Nancy Gale Erickson, 21, a former nurse from New York who lived in Tampa, Florida, and then in Brattleboro, Vermont, before disappearing.
“After years of work on this case, putting a name to Nancy Gale Erickson is incredibly meaningful. It’s more than solving a mystery — it’s restoring her identity and honoring the life she lived. She was never forgotten,” New Hampshire State Police Detective Sgt. Kelly LaPointe said in a Wednesday news release. “We’re deeply grateful to everyone whose efforts made this possible. Now the focus turns to understanding how and why she died.”
According to the release, the unidentified body was first discovered in a wooded area off New Hampshire’s Route 124 on April 16, 1974. Forensic analysis revealed she had died the previous fall. Investigators didn’t find any identification, the release said, and the cause and manner of death was undetermined. Her identity remained unknown for nearly 50 years.
In 2021, Nancy Gale Erickson’s family reported her missing to the Brattleboro Police Department. Between 2022 and 2024, forensic testing determined that the DNA of Erickson’s siblings matched with the remains found in Marlborough.
Erickson was born in Bay Shore, New York, in 1951 and grew up in Elmira, New York. She later moved to Tampa, Florida, and worked as a nurse at Tampa General Hospital. She abruptly left in 1973; according to her siblings, the emotional toll of her work may have played a role in her departure, the release said.
She was later arrested in Vermont for stealing a car. The release cited an article published at the time, which said Erickson told a judge the car had run out of gas, and that she was going to visit friends in White River Junction. The family remembers receiving a call about her arrest, but didn’t know who Erickson may have known in Vermont, according to the release. She received probation and stayed in Brattleboro, where she started working at the Brattleboro Retreat, a private mental health hospital, while living at the Community House, a nonprofit organization offering short-term residential stabilization and assessment programs for children. 
On Oct. 30, 1973, she left her job and residence, and remained unaccounted for until investigators identified her.
“The investigation is active and ongoing,” Christopher Knowles, assistant attorney general in New Hampshire, told VTDigger. “Since 1974, when Ms. Erickson’s body was found, all leads have been followed up by multiple law enforcement agencies, and ultimately, that’s led to our identification today.”
Investigators are asking people who knew Erickson from her college years and colleagues in Brattleboro and Tampa to contact them. Anyone with relevant information can reach out to the New Hampshire Cold Case Unit tip line at 800-525-5555 or coldcaseunit@dos.nh.gov, or submit a tip online.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/farm-bill-ct-agriculture-lamont/,"The bills establish incentives and protections for CT farm owners, including a refundable tax credit and reimbursement for crop losses.","Under gray skies and with the promise of post-event blueberry shortcake, a small crowd gathered for a bill signing ceremony Wednesday morning in South Windsor.  
Standing in front of lush green leaves, Gov. Ned Lamont and Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt joined several Connecticut farmers and state legislators in celebrating a pair of bills that supporters hope will improve the state’s agriculture sector and boost support for local farmers, a group that has faced significant headwinds in recent years. 
“We’re doing everything we can to preserve more farmland, make sure that farmland is there,” Lamont said. “Not just for your generation, but for generations to come.” 
The two bills Lamont signed establish a range of new incentives and protections for farm owners in the state. 
The more comprehensive of the bills, referred to as the “CT Farm Bill,” creates a 20% tax credit for “farm investment property,” establishes a reimbursement program for crop loss and allows the agriculture commissioner to create regulations for drone use in farming. The bill also addresses other aspects of the agriculture industry, including shellfish harvesting and agritourism.  
The second bill creates a land access grant program that will make the costs of purchasing land more affordable and accessible to current and prospective farmers. 
While Echo Farm owner Robert Chang acknowledged that the grant program wouldn’t be a “silver bullet,” he said it will make things easier for future generations interested in farming in the state. 
“If Connecticut is going to have a vibrant farm industry in the future, we are going to need to have anybody who has the knowledge, the skill, the passion and the drive to farm to have the opportunity to be successful,” he added. 
Taken together, the bills mark an important investment in Connecticut’s agricultural industry, arriving as food providers across the country face increasing strain. 
Farmers in Connecticut have navigated an uncertain federal funding landscape in recent months, sparking concerns that the costs for both producing and purchasing food would increase. Severe weather in recent years has also strained local farms, at times wiping out entire crops at once. 
The new laws could be a boon for a key industry in the state. A 2024 analysis of Connecticut’s agricultural sector found that it contributes more than 30,000 jobs — and roughly $4 billion — to the state’s economy. Efforts to bolster the industry and increase the number of farms and farm owners have sparked a number of state initiatives, including a program to train farmers from historically marginalized communities.
But more than that, supporters hope the new laws will further establish that farmers are a vital resource in the state and the region more broadly. 
“These bills are about saying, ‘We love you,’” Lamont said as the event came to a close. “We know how much you mean to the state of Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FarmBillSigning_07092025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 19:18:37.361044

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)While the federal government has to continue allowing Planned Parenthood to receive Medicaid for at least the next two weeks, the organization is looking for state support to make up for expected federal cuts passed in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
Maine lawmakers approved what providers say was a crucial $6 million this year for family planning services, which include things like routine gynecological and well exams, cancer screenings and gender-affirming care but not abortions. However, that is not enough to make up for the loss of federal support, said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. 
“That fills the gap that we had before all of these federal cuts were imposed,” she said. “Now we essentially are asking for the state to help us meet any sort of gap that might exist.” 
The provision in the “big, beautiful bill” that District Court Judge Indira Talwani temporarily blocked prevents nonprofit health centers that provide abortions from being reimbursed by Medicaid for the other services they provide, such as birth control, cancer screenings and annual checkups. 
That would be a funding loss of about $1 million dollars in Medicaid reimbursements that Planned Parenthood and other health care providers are now urging the state to provide, Margulies said. 
Earlier this year, the Trump administration started withholding federal funding from Maine Family Planning, Maine’s statewide grantee for Title X funding, and its affiliates such as Planned Parenthood. Title X is the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. Margulies said Planned Parenthood is still looking to the state to help make up for that loss of about $400,000.
Meanwhile, the organization will continue providing services to patients that need them regardless of whether they can pay while the injunction is in place.
“To be plain about what this means, it means that we remain in the Medicaid program. We can continue to see Medicaid insured patients,” said Nicole Clegg, CEO and President of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, in a press conference Wednesday.“We just can’t receive any payment for the services we are providing to them.”
For the past few weeks, family planning providers have sounded the alarm while the budget reconciliation bill was moving through Congress, calling for Maine’s delegation to vote against it. Despite all four Maine representatives and senators voting against it, President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 4.
Planned Parenthood had sued the Trump administration earlier that same day over keeping Medicaid funding from providers that offer abortions to essentially penalize them, according to the court filings.
“While we welcome the news from the courts, it’s important to highlight that this means our patients, insured by Medicaid, are forced to think through their healthcare needs week to week, day-to-day, whether or not they’re going to have access to us,” Clegg said.
For Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, being unable to accept Medicaid reimbursements means a loss of $5 million, equating to about 42% of annual total patient revenue. 
Without access to the healthcare that Planned Parenthood provides to Medicaid patients, cancers will go undetected, sexually transmitted diseases will be left untreated, and unplanned pregnancies will rise, Clegg said.

That’s how much time passed from when the National Weather Service sent out its first flash flood warning for part of Kerr County to when the first flooding reports came in from low-lying water crossings.
The weather service says that first warning triggered one of many automatic alerts to cell phones and weather radios, telling people in the area of the danger.
But if any local officials got those warnings, and if so, whether they activated in any meaningful way in that 3 hours and 21 minutes remains a black box.
County officials have not responded to requests for interviews and have not said at public press conferences what efforts they took when the flooding threat turned from possible to imminent in the middle of the night. At those press conferences, Kerrville’s city manager has repeatedly said they are focused on search and rescue, rather than answer questions about their response.
“We knew there was a flash flood warning,” Gov. Greg Abbott said at a press conference on Tuesday. “No one would know that would be a 30-foot-high tsunami-ball of water.”
NWS officials said they communicated directly with local officials during the night of the floods, but did not specify when. In some cases, they said, calls went to voicemail. Kerrville’s mayor said he was unaware of the flooding until around 5:30 a.m., more than four hours after that first warning, when the city manager called and woke him up.
Warnings didn’t go up on county Facebook pages until around the same time — when the Guadalupe River had already risen rapidly and pushed out of its banks around Hunt and was making its way toward the county seat of Kerrville.
Weather experts say that — from the outside at least — weather service forecasters appear to have done most everything right as the river rose with astonishing speed, blew past its previous record level and blasted through summer camps, RV parks, homes and campgrounds. It’s the kind of situation that meteorologists warn trainees about, the sort of nightmare scenario some refer to as a silent killer. A holiday weekend that brings out-of-town visitors to the area known as “Flash Flood Alley.”
The worst of the danger arrived in the dark, while people slept. The river claimed more than 90 lives in Kerr County, where many people were still missing more than four days later.
The weather service on Thursday afternoon put out a flood watch, which is a specific threat designation that means the conditions are present for a flood to happen.
“That far ahead of an event like this, that’s the most you can do,” said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and journalist with Yale Climate Connections.
And the agency issued increasingly urgent warnings through the night, which should have given most people enough time to escape death if they received and understood them, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Questions remain about whether people along the river had cell service to get the push alerts, had alerts enabled on their phones, or were even awake to heed them.
Had they been warned of the coming flood, many people could have walked in the rainy darkness to higher ground.
“This really does appear to be a case where had there been even a modest acknowledgement of the level of danger that was predicted by the weather service, I don’t think much of the scope of loss of life would have happened,” Swain said in a public video call Monday.
  Thursday afternoon: The first flood watch 

Emergency officials across Central Texas had reasons to pay attention to the skies well before the deadly flooding occurred and the July 4 holiday weekend got into full swing. Federal forecasters issued a flood watch for a swath of the state at 1:18 p.m. Thursday, including for Kerr County, where at least 30 children would die. Nineteen other people have been confirmed dead in other counties from the widespread floods as of late Tuesday.
A flood watch is intended to indicate to local emergency officials and others that they should be on the lookout, weather experts said. Forecasts on Thursday didn’t say exactly where the worst rain might fall and how much — because that’s very difficult to predict so far ahead, meteorologists said. Where exactly the rain falls can make a big difference in river forecasting.
“I look at flash flood events like this very similarly to tornadoes,” said Alan Gerard, a retired NOAA meteorologist and current CEO of Balanced Weather. “We can tell you the conditions are favorable … but we can’t tell you exactly how strong the tornado is going to be and whether or not it’s going to hit your house.”
Kerr County is part of the Texas Hill Country, where the limestone hills lack deep layers of soil to absorb water. Rivers can rise shockingly fast. Deadly flood events have happened there repeatedly in the past.
The Texas Division of Emergency Management had activated rescue teams and bumped up its readiness level Thursday to bring more help on board. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the regional director for TDEM personally called local officials to discuss the brewing storm. A state rescue task force, military vehicles and aircraft were stationed in the region, mostly in San Antonio, TDEM Chief Nim Kidd said during a press conference Friday night.
But whether Kerr County officials got a call or took any particular action after the July 3 flood watch went out is unclear. At a news conference on Friday as the death toll rose, Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said, “We didn’t know this flood was coming.”
Neither Kelly, the county sheriff nor the emergency management coordinator responded to requests for interviews.
Part of the problem could be alert fatigue, especially in an area known for frequent flooding. People often receive multiple flood watches that don’t result in actual flooding, said Avantika Gori, an assistant professor of civil & environmental engineering at Rice University and flood risk expert. This can lead to complacency, with people thinking, “It’s just another one of those things,” she said.
They may also not understand the difference between a watch and warning, Gori said.
  The first flash flood warning: Friday 1:14 a.m. 

Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, 63, who grew up in the city, recalled seeing reports Thursday night of a chance of rain around the time of the July 4 kids’ bike parade the next day. A friend warned him heavy rain was possible across a large area, but he didn’t feel worried.
“I went outside and looked at the clouds and thought someone is going to get rain, but it’s not going to be us,” he said. He said thunder woke him around midnight, and he was glad to see some rain falling. The Hill Country was in a significant drought.
More specific warnings, which indicate flooding is occurring or imminent, came later in the night as the forecast developed and data poured in. Extra people were on duty at the weather service office in New Braunfels, said Erica Cei, a weather service spokesperson.
At 1:14 a.m., the National Weather Service pushed out its first flash flood warning for central Kerr County, saying that data indicated life-threatening flash flooding was occurring or would begin soon. That message automatically triggered alerts to radios and cell phones, Cei said.
At that point, the river had barely started to rise.
The river was still within its banks in most places, and the incongruity between the warning and what people saw on the ground could potentially have caused people not to take action, Erik Nielsen, an instructional assistant professor at Texas A&M University, said in an email. It’s just one of many challenges of issuing effective warnings that are hard to overcome, he said.
People like Valerie Peters, who was staying at a Kerrville RV campsite called Jellystone Park, woke to the rainfall at some point and said she didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. She said she looked at the emergency notifications, shut the sound off and she went back to bed.
She had been looking forward to a weekend of painting, karaoke and cornhole tournaments with her family. Luckily, her campsite avoided serious damage.
“We could have died,” Peters said. “We had no idea how serious this rain was.”
For officials in the early morning hours, there was still time to act as the rain pounded.
At 4:03 a.m., two hours and 49 minutes after their initial flood warning, federal forecasters warned that the rain had created a flash flood emergency for south-central Kerr County. Weather forecasters only use that term in what the agency says are “exceedingly rare” cases to indicate that lives are very much at risk.
“This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!” the warning said.
The Guadalupe River was rising precipitously. In the nearly three hours since the first warning went out, it had risen 14.3 feet, according to the river level gauge near Hunt, upriver from Kerrville. It would rise another 15.5 feet, according to the data, before the gauge broke.
At 4:35 a.m., three hours and 21 minutes after the first warning, the weather service office started to get reports from the Kerr County sheriff’s office of low-level flooding, Cei said. The river was still rising.
Forecasters pushed out a second flash flood emergency alert at 5:34 a.m., now for east central Kerr County, saying that “a large and deadly flood wave” was headed down the Guadalupe River.
Again, they urged people to get to higher ground immediately. They described the threat of damage as catastrophic.
That was about the time the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office took to Facebook to warn “DANGEROUS FLOODING NOW.” On its Facebook page, Kerr County also posted a warning around then that the river was flooding.
Kerrville’s city manager — who told reporters that he’d been jogging near the river at 3:30 a.m. and saw no signs of flooding — woke the mayor with a phone call around 5:30 a.m. and told him the downtown park where a lot of the July 4th events were planned was under water.
Herring said he threw on some clothes and went downtown.
He got an alert on his phone from the CodeRED system the county uses at 6 a.m., he said, indicating a flash flood alert or “something to that effect.“ Residents can enroll in the system to get alerts. He said it was the only weather alert he got that morning.
  The “last mile” weather alert problem 

Communicating these developing threats as forecasts become more clear is what meteorologists call a “last mile” problem — and it’s long plagued the field. Even as weather service forecasters are issuing warnings, they might have no idea who’s listening or monitoring the situation from the other side.
“The big question marks are, who was the National Weather Service able to reach in person and who was able to monitor the automated warnings that went out through cell phones, through email blasts and so forth at 1, 2, 3, 4 a.m.,” said Henson, the meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections. “And that just comes down to county, local, and even to individual entities like campgrounds.”
At National Weather Service weather forecast offices, it falls to the warning coordination meteorologist — in this case Paul Yura, who retired from a decades-long career in April, a few years earlier than he planned — to build relationships with local community members to prepare for events such as this.
The White House on Monday defended the forecasting agency in the face of questions about whether nationwide staffing cuts had impacted their work.
Two of Mayor Herring’s close friends — Jane Ragsdale, director of the Heart O’ The Hills camp and Dick Eastland, one of the owners of Camp Mystic — died in the flooding and their deaths have hit him hard. He felt sure both would have checked the weather.
“I wish to God there had been some way to warn them,” he said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State leaders are considering their next steps as they face the potential loss of nearly $30 million in federal education funding halted by the Trump administration — a cut that could devastate afterschool programs, multilingual learning, and adult education in Rhode Island.
The funding is part of the roughly $6.8 billion for K–12 school districts nationwide halted abruptly by the U.S. Department of Education last week, despite being earmarked by Congress for programs supporting migrant students and English learners, as well as educator training, school technology, and afterschool programs in high-poverty schools.
“This will impact every single school district in Rhode Island — everyone is going to feel this,” state Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said at a press conference inside the Providence Career & Technical Academy’s library. “No one saw this coming, and we have been left in the dark.”
Funding was expected to be disbursed by the federal government on July 1. 
But just as the work day was wrapping up on June 30, Infante-Green said she received an 83-word email from the U.S. Department of Education. It stated the Trump administration would review federally-funded education programs in order to ensure “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities.” 
The email did not provide any timeline on how long that review would take, and Infante-Green said she still has yet to hear anything back from the Trump administration.
“It’s ridiculous,” she said in an interview with Rhode Island Current. “Historically, we would have gotten projections and gotten the money on July 1.”
 



What the email to the Rhode Island Department of Education said
The following notice was sent by the U.S. Department of Education  to Rhode Island officials on June 30, 2025: 
Federal Notice:
“Given the change in Administrations, the Department is reviewing the FY 2025 funding for the [Title I-C, II-A, III-A, IV-A, IV-B] grant program(s), and decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year. Accordingly, the Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review. The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” 



A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget said in an unsigned emailed statement that federal school funds were withheld after officials found some districts across the country had allegedly misused the money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
The spokesperson claimed New York schools used funds for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for undocumented immigrants. Washington allegedly used the money to give undocumented students scholarships the administration said were “intended for American students.” Grant funds also were supposedly used by an unnamed district for a seminar on “queer resistance in the arts,” according to the office.
“As stated before, this is an ongoing programmatic review and no decisions have been made yet,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson did not answer a question on whether funds had been misused by school  administrators in Rhode Island.
Rhode Island’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner said he believes the Trump administration’s latest funding freeze will be litigated in the courts — with a filing likely within the next few days.
“I have had conversations already with our state’s attorney general and I know he has been in discussions with other states across the country,” he said.
Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office is already involved in a multi-state lawsuit filed in April against the U.S. Department of Education filed in U.S. District Court in Boston after the Trump administration threatened to withhold $116 million in funding for Rhode Island over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

Loss amounts to 17% of K-12 funding
In total, the state stands to lose $29.4 million if the Trump administration continues to withhold the funds. That represents around 17% of the K-12 funding the state receives from the federal government, according to Magaziner’s office.
Nearly $108 million was withheld from Massachusetts, $53.6 million from Connecticut, $27 million from New Hampshire, $26 million from Vermont, and $25 million from Maine.
A breakdown provided by the Rhode Island Department of Education shows that about $6.5 million was designated for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, 16 programs serving students in high-poverty low-performing districts during non-school hours.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said the city relies heavily on federal grants to fund programming, often through the Providence After School Alliance, which operates on a $2 million budget.
“About half of PASA’s budget comes from 21st century grants,” he told reporters. 
Summer programming is still set to go, but cuts may be on the horizon for the fall semester if funding remains held. Those decisions will likely be made in the next month, Smiley said.
The federal freeze risks about $2.4 million in funding for adult education — a cut that organizations like Dorcas International Institute say could hinder Rhode Island’s workforce development. Chief Operating Officer Milagro Sique told reporters the programs help adults build skills in literacy, GED preparation, English language learning, and digital literacy.
Taking away adult education could also hinder a child’s own development, Sique said.
“We know parents are a child’s first teacher,” she said. “If a parent is not thriving, then the child will face challenges in their growth and learning.”
Magaziner called the administration’s freeze “misguided” and “illegal.”
“This is funding that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis,” he told reporters. “In fact, a Republican-controlled Congress passed a budget with this funding and the Trump administration does not have the authority to unilaterally withhold it for no reason.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo issued a statement calling the funding freeze an “assault on public education, teachers, and working families.”
Rhode Island GOP chairman Joe Powers said in a statement that putting federal funds under review was a “reasonable step” by the Trump administration and called Magaziner’s press conference “political theater.”
“These funds were appropriated by Congress with a clear intent to improve education,” Powers said. “And given the state of public education in Rhode Island, we should all be demanding transparency and results.”
As the Trump administration continues to review education spending, Magaziner urged Rhode Islanders to continue to raise the alarm in the hopes the federal government will release the funds — as it has for Head Start and infrastructure money.
“Today is not the end of this fight, it is the beginning,” Magaziner said. “Let’s get a drum beat going — public pressure does matter.”

The private college announced in a news release Tuesday it has selected Susan Stuebner, a former university president who has held various leadership roles at multiple universities, to serve as interim president for the 2025-2026 academic year.
Simpson College launched a national search for an interim leader in May with the goal of having someone in place for the fall, and Stuebner will start in her role July 28.
“I am truly honored to be joining the Simpson community,” Stuebner said in the release. “This is a special place with an inspiring history of distinctive excellence in preparing students to make a profound impact in their professions and the communities they serve. The headwinds remain fierce in higher education, but Simpson is clearly poised for a promising future. I look forward to working closely with our outstanding faculty and staff to maximize the great opportunities ahead of us.”

While her term as interim president is only set for the next academic year, acting board of trustees chair Terry Lillis said she could still earn the full presidency. The board will conduct a review of her service later in the year, after which “mutual interest” in seeing her stay in the role will be determined.
Before coming to Simpson, Stuebner served as president of Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire for eight years before stepping down to advise the college’s interim president. She’s also served in leadership positions at Allegheny College and Lycoming College, both in Pennsylvania.
With Stuebner coming in to lead Simpson College, acting president Terry Handley will step back into his role as chair of the college’s board of trustees, according to the release. Handley was chosen by the board to take on temporary leadership of the college after its president, Jay Byers, was found dead in the president’s residence on campus in April.
“This has been an extraordinarily difficult time for Simpson College,” Handley said in the release. “But the collective strength and resiliency demonstrated by our community has been nothing short of remarkable. We are once again in good hands with the coming leadership of Interim President Stuebner.”

Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology, which is based in Okmulgee, said it will work with the Caddo Nation Economic Development Authority to have the new program operational by fall.
The partnership will offer programs focused on renewable energy development, construction and infrastructure, environmental remediation and utility development to create more career opportunities and support nation building by assisting in orphan well cleanup and solar energy initiatives. 
Brandon Dinsmore, tribal outreach and workforce program specialist, said the university does not know how many students will participate in the skills programs and are still determining tuition rates. The training will primarily take place at the Caddo Nation campus in Binger. 
“This partnership represents a transformative moment for our Nation,” said Bobby Gonzalez, Caddo Nation chairperson in a statement. “By joining forces with OSUIT, we’re not just creating jobs – we’re building the foundation for generational prosperity and economic sovereignty that will benefit our people for decades to come.”
Participants in the program can earn micro credentials, a program focused in a small area of study that upon completion, demonstrates the understanding of specific skills that are required in a workforce. If a participant decides they would like to obtain a degree toward a specific program, they convert those into college credit. Participants will also be able to earn industry certifications in non-credit training programs. 
“This agreement exemplifies OSUIT’s commitment to serving Oklahoma’s diverse communities,” said Trey Hill, vice provost at Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology, in a statement. “Our industry-aligned programs and state-of-the-art facilities provide the perfect foundation for preparing Caddo citizens for high- paying careers in these rapidly growing sectors.”
Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology has previously pursued partnerships with other tribes, including Cherokee Nation Career Services and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation to develop a fiber technician training program.

Free.,US Education Department to revive student loan interest for borrowers in SAVE program,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-revive-student-loan-interest-borrowers-save-program,,"WASHINGTON — Interest accrual on the debt of nearly 7.7 million student loan borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education plan will resume Aug. 1, the U.S. Education Department said Wednesday.The Biden-era income-driven repayment plan better known as SAVE saw legal challenges from several GOP-led states beginning in 2024, creating uncertainty for borrowers who were placed in an interest-free forbearance amid that legal limbo.The SAVE plan, created in 2023, aimed to provide lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and forgive remaining debt after a certain period of time.In February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court injunction that blocked the SAVE plan from going into effect. The department said Wednesday that it’s instructing its federal student loan servicers to start charging interest Aug. 1 to comply with court orders.When the SAVE plan forbearance ends, “borrowers will be responsible for making monthly payments that include any accrued interest as well as their principal amounts,” the department said in a written announcement.“For years, the Biden Administration used so-called ‘loan forgiveness’ promises to win votes, but federal courts repeatedly ruled that those actions were unlawful,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement alongside the announcement.“Congress designed these programs to ensure that borrowers repay their loans, yet the Biden Administration tried to illegally force taxpayers to foot the bill instead,” she added.McMahon said her department is urging borrowers under the SAVE plan to “quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan.”“Borrowers in SAVE cannot access important loan benefits and cannot make progress toward loan discharge programs authorized by Congress,” she said.‘Unnecessary interest charges’Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, blasted the department’s decision in a statement Wednesday.“Instead of fixing the broken student loan system, Secretary McMahon is choosing to drown millions of people in unnecessary interest charges and blaming unrelated court cases for her own mismanagement,” he said.“Every day, we hear from borrowers waiting on hold with their servicer for hours, begging the government to let them out of this forbearance, and help them get back on track — instead, McMahon is choosing to jack up the cost of their student debt without giving them a way out.”The agency has taken heat for its sweeping actions in the months since President Donald Trump took office as he and his administration look to dismantle the department.The department is also mired in a legal challenge over some of its most significant efforts so far, including laying off more than 1,300 employees earlier this year as part of a reduction in force effort, an executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own agency and Trump’s proposal to transfer some services to other federal agencies. These actions have been temporarily halted in court.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump signed a massive tax and spending cut bill into law last week, part of which forces any borrower under the SAVE plan to opt in to a different repayment plan by July 1, 2028, or be automatically placed in a new, income-based repayment plan.",,,,2025-07-09 17:23:05.233501

[…]","Some residents of a small community in the Mississippi Delta say they fear their health might be at risk after a train derailed and spilled a hazardous chemical compound that burned for hours.
Part of a Canadian National Railway train went off the tracks Saturday in Glendora, about halfway between Memphis, Tennessee, and Jackson, Mississippi. The derailment prompted a temporary evacuation of the village after a tank car containing benzene caught on fire.
Desiree Simmons and Diamond Hoskins said they were leaving work at an Emmett Till museum when they realized they had to take their families to safety. The derailment occurred nearby.
“We came out of the building, and all we heard was a ‘boom,’ and the ‘boom’ was a couple feet down from where we was, and all we saw was black smoke,” Simmons told Mississippi Today.
Benzene is used in several products, including detergents and plastics. Symptoms of benzene poisoning include drowsiness, fast or irregular heartbeat, tremors and headaches.
Local fire departments worked several hours to extinguish the flames, according to the Tallahatchie County newspaper, The Sun-Sentinel. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality built a berm around the tank car to contain the spillage and firefighting liquids.
Employees of the Department of Environmental Quality, the state Health Department, Canadian National Railway and the National Transportation Safety Board have been on-site in Glendora, a rural community of about 140 residents. 
No buildings or homes were damaged, but the derailment damaged the main water line, which has since been repaired. Glendora was put under a boil water notice – a common practice after water lines break and temporarily lose pressure.
Simmons and Hoskins picked up their children and quickly left after the derailment. They and some other Glendora residents went to hotels in Cleveland, about 30 miles away, but the women said several people lacked transportation and could not evacuate.
Hoskins said people from CN gathered residents in Glendora on Monday and gave each family a $100 Walmart gift card. 
Since returning home Tuesday, both Simmons and Hoskins say that they and their children experienced headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Both said they plan to visit a doctor soon, and both are worried about their families’ health.
“We’re not using our water. Scared to use it,” she said. “We’ll probably take a shower or something, but I haven’t even cooked because I’m scared of the water.”
Hoskins said there was too little communication from those responding to the derailment.
“How do we know that we haven’t been exposed?” Hoskins said. “How do we know? You’re not reassuring us, you’re not saying nothing to no one.”
Mayor Johnny B. Thomas said he believes the evacuation began too late and ended too soon, and the Glendora community isn’t involved enough in the response.

“They did not evacuate us in a timely manner and in an urgent manner as it should have been with this type of chemical exposure,” Thomas said. 
In a statement to Mississippi Today, the Department of Environmental Quality said air monitoring began promptly after the incident.
“There have been no detectable levels of benzene found and air quality in the community remains at safe levels,” the department said. “Therefore, initial evacuation orders have been lifted.”
The department said air monitoring continues as a precaution.
“We will release any information where there is a threat to public health or the environment,” the department said.

Edward DiPrete, who served three terms as governor and later served time in prison for corruption, staining his legacy, has died.
DiPrete passed away in his home on Tuesday night — the day of his 91st birthday. A former Cranston mayor who went on to serve three terms as governor from 1985 to 1991, DiPrete’s time in office marked a boon for the state Republican Party, though his legacy was tarnished by misconduct allegations and a string of corruption charges. He served a one-year sentence in a plea deal struck in 1998 in exchange for leniency for his son, who was also indicted on criminal corruption charges.
A Cranston native who attended LaSalle Academy in Providence and the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, DiPrete went on to serve in the U.S. Navy before returning to Rhode Island, where he worked in real estate and insurance. His political career kicked off in 1970, when he won a seat on the Cranston School Committee. 
He served two terms on the school board, followed by two terms on the Cranston City Council, and was elected the city’s mayor in 1978. Known as a business-minded pragmatist, DiPrete ascended to the governorship in 1984, winning the open seat by 20 percentage points and returning the GOP to power in Rhode Island. He won two more terms as governor, before losing a fourth reelection bid to Democratic challenger Bruce Sundlun in 1990, with just 26% of the vote. He defeated Sundlun in the prior two gubernatorial elections, scraping by with a 6,600-vote margin in 1988. 
His 1990 loss came despite support from top Republicans, including then-President George H. W. Bush, who came to a Cranston fundraiser in 1989 for DiPrete’s re-election campaign.
Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Joe Powers heralded DiPrete as a “dedicated public servant” in a statement Wednesday. 
“As a lifelong Cranston resident, I knew him not just as governor, but first as my mayor,” Powers said. “He was a fixture in the civic life of our community and a presence in local politics during my formative years. Governor DiPrete embodied the kind of leadership that believed in rolling up your sleeves, knowing your neighbors, and putting Rhode Island first.”
Gov. Dan McKee, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Rhode Island Senate leaders also offered tributes to DiPrete, with McKee ordering state flags at state facilities to fly at half-staff until sunset on the day of DiPrete’s interment.
“Ed will always be remembered as a down-to-earth, approachable leader who cared deeply for his home state,” McKee said in a statement.
Shekarchi also noted DiPrete’s focus on education, and his devotion to family, while Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone noted their shared membership in the Italian American War Veterans of the United States.
But DiPrete’s accomplishments as governor also coincided with a string of scandals that continued well after he left public office. In 1994, he and his son Dennis were indicted for taking bribes in exchange for state contracts awarded during his time as governor — including allegedly rummaging through a dumpster behind a Walt’s Roast Beef in Cranston to retrieve a $10,000 cash bribe he accidentally tossed with his trash.
DiPrete pled guilty to 18 felony counts of bribery, racketeering and perjury in 1998, sentenced to less than one year at the adult Correctional Institute in Cranston. 
DiPrete’s wife, Patricia, died in 2011. He is survived by seven children and numerous grand and great-grandchildren.
Funeral arrangements have not been announced.
DiPrete’s gubernatorial portrait hangs on the third floor of the State House in the southwest corridor between rooms 323 and 324.

Josh Stein vetoed a trio of bills Wednesday, rejecting legislation that would allow private school employees to carry guns, bar local governments from further regulating pet shops and protect nonprofits’ member and donor information.
Stein, a Democrat, also signed a bundle of nine bills into law.
His vetoes go back to the Republican-controlled legislature, where lawmakers can attempt to override them. Any override votes are likely to easily pass in the Senate if all members are present; but in the House, Republicans are one vote short of a party-line supermajority.
Firearms in private schools
House Bill 193 would have allowed employees or volunteers at private schools to carry concealed firearms on school property.
They would have needed written permission from the school board, a valid permit and completed training.
“We cannot substitute the protection offered by well-trained law enforcement officers by asking teachers and school volunteers to step in and respond to crises while armed,” Stein said, citing an incident last year at a Goldsboro school where a student found an employee’s gun in a bathroom.
The veto drew praise Wednesday from North Carolinians Against Gun Violence. It marks Stein’s second veto against Republican firearms bills — he also vetoed a bill allowing for concealed carry of handguns without a permit.
One Democrat, Rep. Shelly Willingham (D-Edgecombe), voted for the bill in the House. Two Democrats and eleven Republicans were absent or did not vote.
Pet shop regulation restrictions
House Bill 96 would have banned local governments from prohibiting or restricting animal sales from licensed pet shops.
That language, which Stein said was the reason he vetoed the bill, was added to legislation originally meant to speed up the process to remove squatters from properties.
“This bill would facilitate inhumane puppy mills in North Carolina,” Stein said. “Without this provision, I would sign the legislation. With it, I cannot support it.”
All House Republicans voted for the bill, along with 17 Democrats.
Nonprofit privacy
Senate Bill 416 would bar public agencies from collecting or releasing unnecessary information about 501(c) nonprofit organizations’ donors, members or volunteers.
It also contains language that effectively freezes grant funding for IOLTA — a legal aid fund.
“This bill reduces transparency and creates more opportunity for dark money in our politics, especially relating to candidates’ legal funds,” Stein said. “Furthermore, it makes it difficult, if not impossible,for the Department of Revenue to identify and crack down on certain types of tax fraud.”
Three Democrats — Reps. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), Charles Smith (D-Cumberland) and Willingham — joined Republicans voting for the bill.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court won’t allow Florida to enforce its undocumented immigrant illegal entry and re-entry law while litigation continues in the case that led to a federal judge finding the state’s top legal officer in contempt of court.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier had asked the nation’s highest court to remove a temporary block on enforcement of the law, which police and state troopers carried out even after the judge barred it. But the Supreme Court on Wednesday decided not to interfere.
At issue is SB 4C, a law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in February, which makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.” Despite the intent to tackle illegal immigration, the law led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen from Georgia.
Florida lawmakers passed the law during a special session, and DeSantis signed it on Feb. 13 to align the state with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration. The Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state in April.
The Supreme Court’s decision came two days after the U.S. Department of Justice asked an appellate court to lift the block on the law, filing a brief stating that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams, in the Southern District of Florida, erred in her decision.
“Florida’s law is in harmony, not conflict, with federal law,” the brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit states.
Both Williams and the Eleventh Circuit ruled that federal law likely preempts the state law, as the reasoning for the temporary block.
“This ruling affirms what the Constitution demands — that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that no one should be stripped of their liberty without due process,” said Bacardi Jackson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida.
“Florida’s attempt to bypass federal authority and weaponize local law enforcement to police immigration status was not only unlawful, but it also put thousands of people at risk of unjust detention, separation, and abuse. We are grateful the Court upheld the block, and we remain committed to defending the rights and humanity of all Floridians.”
The attorney general must submit biweekly reports detailing arrests under the law as part of Williams’ ruling finding Uthmeier in civil contempt of court over his disobedience of her order to call off enforcement.
The first biweekly report from July 1 shows that St. Johns County arrested two men on counts of illegal entry on May 29.
A spokesperson for Uthmeier did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

UMass Memorial said the merger will allow Marlborough Hospital to improve access to specialty services, plus eliminate costs tied to maintaining separate hospital licenses, governing bodies and staffing infrastructure.
The post Merger the latest shift in Central Mass. health care world appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PUBLIC HEALTH regulators approved the merger of UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMMC) and Marlborough Hospital on Wednesday, with the licensing overhaul deepening an existing affiliation that’s expected to improve patient care and reduce operating costs.
The UMass Memorial Health system encompasses UMMMC, an academic medical center, and four community hospitals, including the 79-bed Marlborough Hospital. All hospitals in the system are licensed independently, and Marlborough Hospital is the smallest of the facilities, said Dennis Renaud, director of the Determination of Need program at the Department of Public Health. 
The Public Health Council approved UMass Memorial Health’s DoN application for a transfer of ownership, allowing Marlborough Hospital to become a licensed campus of UMMMC. Marlborough Hospital, while formerly owned by a different nonprofit, has already been affiliated with UMass Memorial for more than two decades, according to a filing with the Health Policy Commission. 
UMass Memorial said the merger will allow Marlborough Hospital to improve access to specialty services, plus eliminate costs tied to maintaining separate hospital licenses, governing bodies and staffing infrastructure.
“The applicant states that, due to its small size, Marlborough Hospital does not have sufficient inpatient volume to independently support a full array of hospital and specialty service lines needed by the community,” Renaud told the council. “Consequently, patient access to services at Marlborough Hospital are impacted by the ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining primary care and specialty care physicians needed to support an acute care hospital in the community.”
Those factors have led to heightened on-call demand for physicians, Renaud said. Marlborough Hospital in the last year has also reduced or cut access to anesthesia weekend coverage, general surgery and urology, creating a model that is “not sustainable” for ensuring access to care, he said.
Rep. Danielle Gregoire, a Marlborough Democrat, voiced her support for the merger. She said some patients are currently forced to seek care outside the UMass system, with some traveling to costlier hospitals in Boston.
“It’s critical that we protect and enhance the services offered at Marlborough Hospital so that residents across central Massachusetts can continue to receive high-quality care close to where they live and work, now and in the future,” Gregoire said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-09 20:46:31+00:00,CT Mirror,"Utility accuses PURA of defying court order, again",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/utility-accuses-pura-of-defying-court-order-again/,"Avangrid has sought to connect PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillett with an op-ed accusing the state's utilities of engaging in ""propaganda.""","The electric and gas utility Avangrid on Wednesday again accused its Connecticut regulators of openly defying a court order to produce documents that have become subject to public records requests and widespread speculation regarding an alleged anti-utility bias at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
The company’s comments came after another batch of records was released by the state on Tuesday in response to a lawsuit challenging the regulators’ decision last year to cut Avangrid’s gas rates.
As part of that lawsuit, Avangrid attorneys have sought to connect PURA Chairwoman Marissa Gillett with an op-ed signed by two state lawmakers last December accusing the state’s utilities of engaging in “propaganda” by pinning their financial hardships on decisions being made by regulators.
If Gillett played a role in drafting that op-ed, the attorneys argue, it would reveal a level of bias that should have led her to recuse herself from the company’s rate case. Both Gillett and the op-ed’s authors, however, have repeatedly said that she did not have a hand in writing or editing the piece.
Much of the debate has focused on string of text messages Gillett sent to one of the authors, state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport — which were later released through public records requests — in which she said she had completed an unspecified “draft” days before the op-ed was published in the Connecticut Mirror on Dec. 19. 
Avangrid’s attorneys have argued that the “draft” is likely a reference to the op-ed and have repeatedly sought additional records and communications to prove the connection. Last month, attorneys for PURA said they had uncovered additional records related to the “draft” and promised to release them after the July 4 holiday.
When those new documents were released on Tuesday evening, however, they contained no reference to the controversial op-ed — or to Steinberg and his co-author, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex. 
“In defiance of clear court orders, PURA still has not produced the “draft” referenced in the Chairs’ text exchange with Rep. Steinberg or PURA’s text messages used to circumvent Connecticut public records law,” Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for the utilities, said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue all means available in our litigation to get to the truth of this important matter.” 
The pages of emails and letters that were released by the Attorney General’s office did include three examples of “drafts” that Gillett and her staff were working on at around the same time the op-ed was published.
Those drafts included responses to two other lawmakers who had wrote to PURA with questions about the rollout of smart metering technology, as well as a response to questions from a reporter who was working on a story about Gillett. None of the emails released on Tuesday indicated that Gillett had shared any of those drafts with Steinberg.
Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office referred to written records in the lawsuit. A spokesperson for PURA did not respond to a request for comment.
Steinberg said Wednesday it had been months since the conversation with Gillett and that he no longer remembers what “draft,” specifically, she was referring to. “I don’t have any specific reference for you, I’m sorry,” he said.
Wednesday was not the first time that Avangrid has accused regulators of defying a judge’s orders to produce records related to the op-ed and its authorship. 
After an initial round of discovery was completed earlier this year, attorneys for the utility called PURA’s responses “incomplete, evasive, and noncompliant” for failing to include the “draft” document mentioned in Gillett’s texts to Steinberg, or copies of the conversation from her cell phone. 
In a response filed with the court on June 6, Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander said that PURA had already conducted multiple searches of its records and could not find any documents relating to the drafting of the op-ed. That search included reviews of the personal and work phones for Gillett and her chief of staff, Theresa Govert.
Attorneys for the utility, he wrote, had developed “a theory that other documents ‘must exist’ concerning the drafting or authorship of the op-ed based upon a self-serving interpretation and even speculation about an exchange of text messages.”
“Yet, apart from one single ambiguous text message, Plaintiffs have nothing to support their theory,” he added.
During a hearing a few weeks later, however, Hollander revealed that Gillett’s texts with Steinberg had been subject to an auto-delete function on her personal phone and were no longer recoverable. That prompted the judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, to order depositions of both Gillett and Govert to determine whether either had any role in drafting the op-ed.
Those depositions were delayed by up to a week, however, after Hollander emailed Avangrid’s attorneys on June 27 to say that PURA had identified an additional batch of documents related to the “draft” mentioned in Gillett’s texts to Steinberg. 
It was that batch of documents that was released on Tuesday, prompting Avangrid to again accuse PURA of ignoring the judge’s discovery orders.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_105-2025_0630-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 17:23:05.233501

Mike Kehoe speaks during a mid-legislative-session press conference with GOP leadership (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).There could be more retired teachers returning as substitutes and more home-schooled students will be able to participate in sports and other school activities, thanks to a stack of bipartisan education bills signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed 13 bills Wednesday, including numerous education provisions passed in a handful of bipartisan bills. Several more bill signings are planned before all work on legislation from the 2025 session hits a Monday deadline.
State lawmakers this year debated a number of controversial proposals, like opening up school district enrollment boundaries or allowing for alternative methods of school accreditation. But the majority of education legislation that made it to the governor was widely supported on both sides of the aisle.
“From implementing distraction-free classrooms to expanding school safety efforts, the legislation signed into law this afternoon impacts both K-12 students and Missourians pursuing higher and career technical education,” Kehoe said in a news release.
Here are some of the provisions Kehoe signed into law:
Encouraging retired educators to substitute teach
Retired teachers may continue to fill in as substitutes on a part-time or temporary basis until 2030 without losing their benefit from the Public School Retirement System.
The legislation is an extension of a 2022 law that was due to sunset this year. Three years ago, lawmakers saw a need to bring retirees into classrooms as COVID-19 reduced the teacher workforce and put a 2025 expiration on the provision.
But the need for substitutes still exists.
In the 2023-24 school year, 4,500 retired educators served as substitutes, according to data from the Public School and Education Employee Retirement Systems of Missouri.
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican and House Education Committee chair, told The Independent last month that the law helps keep trained teachers in front of students.
“There would be open positions that would not get filled around the state (if the provision didn’t pass),” he said. “Many of them we would have completely unqualified people in those positions, when you have perfectly qualified people who might be a little bit older but have tons of experience.”
This legislation applies to part-time and temporary substitutes. A different statute allows a handful of retirees to work full-time. Since 2003, retired teachers have been able to return full-time for two years, which lawmakers increased to four years in 2023.
  State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, D-Columbia, speaks on the House floor during the June special session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Cell phone limitations
School districts will be required to establish policies for the upcoming school year that restrict cell-phone usage during the school day with few exceptions.
Students with a disability that requires use of a mobile device are exempted, and cell phones are allowed during safety emergencies. Otherwise, including during lunch and between classes, students will be expected to keep their cell phones stowed unless told otherwise by a teacher.
Roughly 53% of school leaders believe that cell-phone usage has hurt students’ learning abilities and 72% say it has negatively impacted mental health, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. A St. Louis University/YouGov poll earlier this year found 76% of Missourians favor restrictions for elementary students, 75% for middle school and 70% for high school.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Democrat from Columbia, filed the bill this session with a proposal only to ban cell phone use during instructional time. Lawmakers ultimately passed a more restrictive policy, and Steinhoff believes kids will benefit.
“The statistics really do hold that if we do the (full day), bell to bell,” Steinhoff told The Independent in May. “That’s going to have the biggest turnaround.”

Homeschoolers in extracurricular activities
Home-educated students will be able to join public schools’ extracurricular activities in the upcoming school year.
The legislation, proposed for over a decade in Missouri, will require public schools to allow homeschooled students to try out for sports teams and join clubs beginning in August.
Previously, the Missouri State High School Activities Association allowed homeschoolers to join public-school teams if they were enrolled in two classes at the school. Districts could have more restrictive policies, with many denying access to those who weren’t publicly educated full-time.
For years, families with young athletes and performers have testified at the State Capitol for access to extracurricular activities. Some lawmakers worried about homeschooled students having separate academic and attendance standards, saying their participation could be unfair.
But ultimately, it passed the Senate 30-3 and the House 94-44.
  Sen. Rusty Black, R-Chillicothe, sits at his desk on the first day of the 2024 Legislative Session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
School chaplains
A new law will allow school districts to hire chaplains or accept them as volunteers.
The bill was not as widely accepted as some other education provisions passed this year and drew criticism from lawmakers who worry chaplains would use the opportunity to evangelize students instead of comforting those who already share their faith.
The bill’s sponsor state Sen. Rusty Black, a Chillicothe Republican and former educator, said he filed the bill to help students’ and teachers’ wellbeing.
“Allowing a school district to employ or have a chaplain as a volunteer would benefit students and faculty who are struggling mentally and spiritually,” he said in the Senate’s discussion of the legislation in February.
During the bill’s hearing in the Senate Education Committee, a minister with the Satanic Temple of Missouri Virgil Ovid said he would welcome the opportunity to become a school chaplain.
Lawmakers then added language that would limit chaplains to those that are members “of a Department of Defense listed religious-endorsing organization recognized by the Armed Forces Chaplains Board,” which excludes satanic ministers.
CROWN Act
Legislation also signed Wednesday will ban hair discrimination in educational settings. Dubbed the “CROWN Act,” which stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, the law is part of a national movement to protect textured hair.
The cities of St. Louis and Kansas City have protections for natural hair textures, and at least 27 states have enshrined the CROWN Act.
The bill’s sponsor state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, told the Senate in May that she has seen people treat her and loved ones differently based on hair texture. She hopes students can be free from the pressure to change their hair and should not lose out on opportunities “simply because they chose to wear their hair in braids or an afro or dreadlocks.”
The legislation bars educational institutions receiving state funds from placing restrictions on natural styles “commonly associated with a particular race or origin.” 
Safety measures, like requiring hair nets, are permitted.
Missouri State University may offer PhD programs
Lawmakers chipped away at the University of Missouri System’s exclusive rights to certain degrees, opening the doors for Missouri State University to offer doctoral degrees.
State law has historically limited certain degree programs in public universities, giving the University of Missouri System dominance over PhD programs and research doctorates. But the changes will let Missouri State offer doctorate of philosophy degrees in subjects other than engineering.
“This legislation marks a significant milestone for Missouri State University,” Missouri State President Richard B. Williams said in a May press release. “The ability to independently offer doctoral programs will help us better meet regional workforce needs across southwest Missouri and the state.”

Career-technical education scholarships
Missouri high school graduates will be able to attend career-tech programs using a grant mirrored after the state’s A+ Program beginning in the 2026-27 school year.
Legislation sponsored by state Rep. Ann Kelley, a Republican from Lamar, will use state funds to help students pursue careers in fields like agriculture, nursing, cosmetology and other areas with career-certificate programs.
“This will increase (the workforce) astronomically,” Kelley told The Independent. “And it’s great for the kids who are in those career-tech programs. It gives them another avenue to make themselves better.”
To qualify, students will need to graduate high school with at least a 2.5 GPA, at least 95% attendance rate, 50 hours of unpaid tutoring and achieve proficiency in the Algebra I end-of-course exam. Students with high school career-tech certificates will also be eligible.
Universally transferable associate’s degrees
State-funded colleges will expand the number of courses universally transferable in Missouri with a charge from lawmakers to collaborate on five 60-credit-hour degree programs.
Since the 2018-19 school year, students have been able to transfer 42 credit hours between community colleges and universities that receive state funding. The new law will add 18 more transferable credit hours in the programs of business, biology, elementary education, psychology and nursing.
Community colleges spoke in favor of the legislation in a House hearing, while representatives from four-year institutions said they hoped existing articulation agreements could stand.
Colleges must have the degree programs negotiated and ready by the 2028-29 school year.
“If you go to a community college in southeast Missouri and you transfer to a four year school in northwest Missouri, we want it to be a seamless transition across the state,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Cameron Parker of Campbell, told The Independent. “So if you go to any community college, you will know what any of the four-year schools are going to take.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-09 20:34:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Several incarcerated at Cheshire Correctional begin hunger strike,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/hunger-strike-cheshire-correctional-lockdowns/,The striking individuals say recent lockdowns have been excessive. DOC and union leaders cite staffing shortage.,"Several men incarcerated at Cheshire Correctional Institution have begun a hunger strike in protest of what they describe as excessive lockdowns, low quality food and poor medical care. 
The hunger strike began Monday. According to Cornel Myers, who is participating in the hunger strike at Cheshire, there are nine people in total who are refusing to eat. 
“We have no intention of stopping,” Myers told the Connecticut Mirror. 
Rashad Sellers, who is also part of the hunger strike at Cheshire, told CT Mirror that the striking individuals have a list of demands, including better health care and improved quality of food — including that no food be served out of the kitchen, which has had problems with rat infestations. They are also asking that they be allowed a legally-mandated five hours per day of out-of-cell time, the ability to shower after recreational time, improvements to the law library and increases in pay for their work so they can afford increasing prices of goods at the commissary.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said in an email that Cheshire has been locked down five times in the past two weeks — although people incarcerated at Cheshire say the number has been higher. Banevicius said two of the five lockdowns happened overnight, while people were asleep. Another two happened back-to-back, during the day and evening on June 29. He said the June 29 lockdowns were due to multiple “code whites” — instances where an incarcerated person is found unresponsive, requiring a hospital visit. 
But Sellers said the facilities were on a “modified lockdown” from July 3 through July 6, when they received only an hour of recreation in the morning and an hour in the evening. He added that the facility locks down every Wednesday so that corrections officers can undergo training. 
Banevicius said Wednesday training sessions only last a few hours, and are run on different shifts “in order to lessen the impact on particular programs/activities.”
Another individual incarcerated at Cheshire told CT Mirror that the facility was on a modified lockdown for part of the day July 2 and July 3 for the wake and funeral of a corrections officer. Banevicius confirmed this. 
Banevicius said staff members at Cheshire met with people on hunger strike “shortly after the initial group began abstaining from food,” to hear their concerns. He said two of the individuals intended to end their strike later in the day Wednesday.
“Staff of the Cheshire facility will continue to address the remaining individuals’ concerns to the fullest extent possible,” Banevicius said. 
Banevicius said after people have abstained from eating and drinking for more than 48 hours, they are “assessed by the Department’s medical and mental health staff to insure they receive appropriate treatment and care.”
Staffing requirements
Collin Provost, former president of AFSCME Local 391, the union representing corrections officers, and current service representative with the union, said there’s no hard and fast rule for when a lockdown goes into place. Different facilities have different staffing requirements for recreational time, showering or other programming. 
Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward told CT Mirror that over the last four weeks, he’d received between 15 and 20 complaints about the lockdowns at Cheshire.
According to part of an incident report that Ward shared with CT Mirror over the phone, Cheshire went into a lockdown on June 15 — Father’s Day — from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Ward said the facility needed to fill 80 posts to operate that day, but only 39 corrections officers were scheduled to work. Even after five others volunteered to work overtime, and an additional 18 were mandated, 22 posts were “shut down,” or went unfilled. 
Ward said that when he spoke with wardens in the department, they said there’s little they can do to address the problem, since the corrections officers are allowed to take vacation time. Ward said this essentially gives corrections officers control over whether a facility goes into lockdown. 
Banevicius said lockdowns are dictated by staffing levels, and that if low staffing levels require a lockdown, the staffing levels usually will be replenished on the following shift. 
Ward warned against using hunger strikes as a way to communicate with the department, saying it could put incarcerated people at risk. 
“This is not a highly capable medical system, and to do things to weaken your immune system … to make a point about a larger issue that is up to the legislature and lawmakers is just not a great way to go about that,” he said. 
Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros told state legislators in February that the department had over 500 vacancies for corrections officers.
AFSCME’s Provost said vacancies are often cyclical, driven by when each class of corrections officers completes 20 years of service and is able to retire.
But Quiros said that in the 35 years he’s worked at DOC, it’s always had between 300 and 600 vacancies. He also told the lawmakers that the number of incarcerated people has increased in recent years. 
According to state data, the incarcerated population has risen from about 9,000 in July 2021 to 11,100 as of this June. 
Overtime pay for corrections officers has also shot up over the last five years, according to Connecticut’s Open Payroll database. In 2019, the state paid corrections officers $54.5 million in overtime. In 2024, that number had risen to $82.6 million. 
According to Quiros, the top reasons for staffing shortages are vacancies and officers taking time away for workers’ compensation, followed by people being out sick or caring for sick family members. 
Banevicius said 194 corrections officers were out on workers’ compensation claims as of July 1. Provost said most claims are connected to people injured during an emergency — for example, running to a medical call or lifting someone to be transported.  
“It’s a situation where … you’re constantly dealing with felons and they’re not always cooperative to think that you’re going to help them. And it’s your job to help them no matter what,” Provost said. 
He said there had also been an increase in people going out on military leave and on family medical leave, which he said was connected to having more female corrections officers. He said people also take time off for vacation, which isn’t factored in when calculating staffing levels. 
Provost said that recruiting and retaining corrections officers has become increasingly challenging. He said that in the 20 years he worked as a corrections officer, wages and benefits stagnated; there were several years he did not receive a wage increase.
He compared the starting salary of a corrections officer, $53,700 after they graduate from the academy, to that of a state police trooper, $76,600, according to the State Police. “The disparity is huge,” he said. 
Provost also said it’s difficult to make the corrections officer job attractive, and suggested a need for some kind of marketing campaign to draw more people in. He noted that the staffing shortages meant that officers who do take jobs with the department are the ones who are then forced to accept mandatory overtime shifts. 
DOC Commissioner Quiros told lawmakers in February that in the 35 years he has worked at DOC, the department had never reached 100% staffing. He said there’s generally a shortage of anywhere between 300 and 600 corrections officers on the department’s payroll. 
A series of strikes
The hunger strike in Cheshire follows two other hunger strikes at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in June and September. The reasons for the September hunger strike were similar to the reasons for the current one at Cheshire: lockdowns, medical care and food quality. 
Myers, who also participated in the September hunger strike at MacDougall-Walker, told CT Mirror that the lockdowns at Cheshire are worse.
He also noted that at MacDougall, people on hunger strike would be able to go to the infirmary, but in Cheshire, they have to remain with the general population “walking around weak and dizzied.” 
Ward said he’s received many complaints about medical care and the food quality from incarcerated individuals. A bill passed this spring in the state legislature gives Ward’s office the power to conduct investigations into any complaints around health care and to collect data on things like appointment wait times and access to medication and medical care. It also requires DOC to provide mental health assessments for incarcerated people when they first enter the department. 
The same bill bans the use of nutraloaf — a mismash of different types of food that is condensed into a large loaf — as a punishment, and requires “palatable” meals.  
Ward said the meals served in Connecticut’s prisons are often high in sodium, highly processed and low in protein. He said he plans to release a report later this year that will look into food services at the state’s correctional facilities. 
Banevicius said the facility menus are created to be in alignment with U.S. Department of Agriculture “Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” and that they meet or exceed a variety of dietary standards developed by national expert organizations. Regarding health care, he said the department “continually strives to provide quality care to the incarcerated population.” He noted that the department spent $150 million on health care services last year. 
“The Department takes the health and safety of all individuals in our custody very seriously,” Deputy Commissioner William Mulligan said in a statement. “We respect the rights of individuals to voice their concerns, we are reviewing their demands to determine what can be addressed within the framework of departmental policy and public safety.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1109_SR_CheshirePrison_016-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 17:23:05.233501

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida University University community gathered Wednesday to showcase the creation of an institute in its College of Medicine and a pilot program that will provide free genetic screening to newborns, established by HB 907, passed this spring. 
The Florida Institute for Pediatric Rare Diseases was a “labor of love” for state Rep. Adam Anderson, the Palm Harbor Republican first elected to the House in 2022. It memorializes his late son Andrew, felled by Tay-Sachs disease, a deadly genetic malady.
Anderson called the project a “truly a historic milestone that’s giving Florida a once-in-a generation opportunity to lead the nation in genetic and precision medicine,” adding that “half-a-dozen” states have reached out to him about the idea. 
The law establishes a five-year pilot program, called “Sunshine Genetics,” that allows parents of newborns to screen their children for rare diseases at no cost using genomic sequencing, or reading DNA.
Anderson’s son was born with Tay-Sachs, which damages nerves in a child’s brain, although he and his wife weren’t aware until Andrew was over a year old. He died at age 4.
The law charges the institute to research causes and treatments for rare pediatric diseases, develop faster and more accurate genetic screening tools, and educate pediatricians, genetic counselors. and others about rare diseases. 
“But this is not only about diagnosis and treatment. This is about the future.  This is about research,” said Pradeep Bhide, director of the FSU institute, emphasizing the usefulness of the anonymized data the project will compile. 
The law creates the Sunshine Genetics Consortium of researchers, geneticists, and physicians from Florida universities and children’s hospitals.

The institute was established by FSU a year ago after it was allocated $5 million in the state budget.
The 2025-26 budget allocated $3 million for the Sunshine Genetics pilot program and $4.5 million for the institute, although the originally proposed version of HB 907 called for $25 million.
FSU dedicated $2 million to the initiative, too.
“Your work today is providing hope to countless families, but it’s just a matter of time before that hope is transformed into cures for rare diseases,” Anderson said, thanking the people involved in the institute. 
FSU President Richard McCullough said the passage of the bill was a “big deal.”
“I’ve been in Florida for almost four years now. It’s not easy to get those three signatures,” McCullough said, gesturing to a enlarged copy of the bill bearing the House speaker’s, Senate president’s, and governor’s signatures.

Pilot
Currently, the Department of Health’s Florida Newborn Screening Program sweeps in before Florida babies are discharged from the hospital and tests for about 60 diseases. 
Under the new, optional pilot program, FSU can screen for approximately 7,000 rare diseases, Bhide told the Phoenix. Of those, about 600 have actionable treatments.
Anderson said he wasn’t sure if he would’ve consented to his children’s DNA being sequenced at the time they were born, but, “I didn’t know what I know today back then,” he said.
“The unique thing about genetic testing at birth is that if there is a genetic abnormality, oftentimes you wouldn’t know about this for three, four, five, seven, even more years down the road. But if we’re doing this sequencing at birth, then it can be detected, and that child will have an option for rapid and early treatment of that condition,” Anderson said. 
Anderson said his vision is for the program to operate statewide. For now, it’s at select hospitals in the state.
The program can’t exist solely with taxpayer dollars for the longterm, Anderson said.
“Today I’m calling on biotech firms and gene therapy firms, genetic medicine companies, and nonprofits throughout the country.  Partner with us. Help us to fund this program. Help us to grow the program, join the consortium, be on the right side of medical history, and help us bring whole genome sequencing to every newborn child, statewide.” Anderson said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and the American Humanist Association filed suit in January against the board to stop it from issuing the grant to the College of St. Joseph the Worker, a college university based in Steubenville, Ohio. The school was awarded the money in 2024 to expand operations into the state.The grant was first reported by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and the News and Sentinel. 
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Richard Lindsay ruled from the bench that the constitution prohibits the use of public funds for religious education and advocacy, according to a news release from the ACLU. Lindsay gave the Water Development authority 30 days to show evidence of its compliance with the constitution, the ACLU said.  
In the lawsuit, the organizations argue that in granting the money to the Ohio school, the Water Development Authority abdicated its duties of providing financial assistance to West Virginia communities to protect water quality and public health and encourage economic growth and violated the guarantee of freedom of religion codified in the state constitution. 
“We’re proud to have taken a stand on behalf of our members and are encouraged that the court held the line on this unconstitutional appropriation of funds,” Amitai Heller, legal director for the American Humanist Association, said in the news release. “The separation of church and state is a nonnegotiable, and the West Virginia Water Development Authority had no business granting public infrastructure dollars to fund religious education and advocacy. Our members saw this blatant violation of church-state separation happening in their community and in concert with the ACLU of West Virginia, we acted.
“Public dollars should always serve the public good, and we will keep fighting in the courts to defend this principle as long as we need to,” Heller said. 
The Water Development Authority did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment Wednesday.

Tony Evers in his ad for wanting to raise taxes, his actions handling the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, vetoing a bill that would have banned transgender girls from participating on sports teams in an ad posted to YouTube and X. (Screenshot from campaign ad)Bill Berrien, a Republican businessman and former Navy SEAL, officially launched his campaign for governor Wednesday, comparing himself to President Donald Trump and declaring his support for cutting taxes, deportation efforts and barring transgender girls from locker rooms.
Berrien is the second Republican to officially launch his campaign for governor. He joins Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann who announced in May and has already been on the road pitching himself to fellow Republicans. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has also been considering a run for the office. 
“Just like President Trump, I’m a political outsider and a businessman. It’s time that we fire the bureaucrats and hire a businessman to fix the problems and take our state back,” Berrien said in a statement. It’s a shift for Berrien, who supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary and donated over $30,000 to her campaign — a track record that led to pushback against his candidacy from some Wisconsin conservatives. 
In an ad, Berrien spoke over a clip of Trump pumping his fist after last year’s assassination attempt. 
“A Navy SEAL is never out of the fight,” Berrien said as the clip played. “We’ve seen that fighting spirit from President Trump. It’s the same fight it takes to run a Wisconsin manufacturing business.”
“I’ll shake up Madison like he’s shaking up D.C.,” Berrien added. 
For the last 13 years, Berrien has worked as the owner and chief executive officer of Pindel Global Precision Inc. and Liberty Precision New Berlin contract manufacturers that make machined parts for an array of industries including aerospace, agricultural products, medical and firearms. 
A December 2024 report from WUWM details Berrien’s recent role as vice chair of the Wisconsin Defense Industry Council, a collaboration of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, that seeks to push for more weapons production in Wisconsin. At the time, Berrien said he wanted to figure out how to encourage companies to supply directly to the Department of Defense and also connect businesses with “defense primes” — companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. 
Prior to working in the private sector, Berrien served as a Navy SEAL for nine years. He currently lives in Whitefish Bay with his wife and is the father of three. 
The Republican  hopefuls  have bashed incumbent Gov. Tony Evers, who hasn’t decided whether he’ll run for a third term. Evers said he would decide after the state budget process, which was completed last week, and this week said at a visit to Milwaukee to highlight the budget that he expects to announce a decision in a “couple weeks.”
Berrien criticized Evers in his ad for wanting to raise taxes, his actions handling the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, vetoing a bill that would have banned transgender girls from participating on sports teams and locker rooms that align with their gender identity and for using the term “inseminated person” in a section of his budget proposal on artificial insemination. 
Berrien also criticized the movement of manufacturing jobs to China by “globalists” and took a swipe at “career politicians.” 
“Enough,” Berrien said. “I will cut taxes, increase wages and make Wisconsin the manufacturing powerhouse to the world, again.” He also said he would use law enforcement to keep “criminal illegal” immigrants out of Wisconsin and “keep boys out of our daughters’ sports and locker rooms.” 
“President Trump is taking back Washington for the American people,” Berrien said at the end of the ad — naming Trump for the fourth time during the 99 second spot. “Now it’s time to take back our state.” 
Berrien launched his “Never Out of The Fight” PAC in April to help “further” conservative causes and push Republican candidates to “get back to winning.” It reported raising $1.2 million in its first three months, according to WisPolitics.
Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker criticized Berrien, saying he was “rich enough to buy himself some attention and clueless enough to think that’s going to work — just like Elon Musk did this past April only to see his political career end.” 
The state party is “already building on our playbook that helped take down Brad Schimel, Tim Michels, and Eric Hovde,” Remiker said. “We have no doubt we’ll be in an even stronger position to defeat whoever Trump hand picks to do his bidding in the primary and emerges as the nominee.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The Wisconsin Elections Commission found that the city of Madison failing to count nearly 200 absentee ballots cast in last year’s November election was the result of a “confluence of errors” and a “complete lack of leadership” in the city clerk’s office, according to a draft report of WEC’s investigation into the incident. 
The Madison city clerk’s office told the elections commission in a memo Dec. 20 about the lost ballots from two Madison wards. A bag containing 68 unprocessed absentee ballots from two wards was found Nov. 12 in a tabulator bin, the memo stated. During reconciliation of ballots on Dec. 3, clerk employees found two sealed envelopes containing a total of 125 unprocessed absentee ballots from another ward. The discovery of the missing ballots was announced to the public Dec. 26. 
The missing ballots were not enough to change the result of any local, state or federal elections.
WEC’s investigation into the matter was led by the commission’s chair, Ann Jacobs, a Democratic appointee, and Don Millis, the commission’s most recent Republican-appointed chair. The investigation took six months and involved 13 depositions and the review of more than 2,000 documents. 
The report on the investigation, which goes to the full commission for approval in a meeting next week, found five counts in which the city’s clerk, Maribeth Witzel-Behl, acted “contrary to” state election law. 
Witzel-Behl resigned from her position in April after nearly 20 years as city clerk. 
The investigation found that the city exposed itself to mistakes by printing the pollbooks for polling places — the log in which election staff records when a voter’s ballot has been received and counted — three weeks before Election Day. That time frame meant that by the time polls opened on Nov. 5, the record in the book of which voters had already returned their absentee ballot was out of date. 
Additionally, the city “failed to track absentee envelopes and bags” meaning that large manila envelopes and courier bags full of absentee ballots weren’t numbered and organized by ward. 
“This meant that the polling places would not know how many Courier Bags or Carrier Envelopes to expect and with what seal numbers,” the report states. “Had they been given those numbers, they would have been able to immediately know if they were short a bag or an envelope and could have immediately looked for the missing item.”
According to the report, the most likely explanation for the ballots not being counted at the polling places on Election Day is that they were never delivered to the polls. 
Much of the report is a blistering criticism of Witzel-Behl’s leadership and response to the missing ballots, particularly her decision to leave on vacation on Nov. 13 — while the city was still working through the ballot reconciliation process. 
“The lack of action by the City Clerk with regard to the found ballots is astonishing,” the report states. “She demonstrated no urgency, let alone interest, in including those votes in the election tally. At the time the Ward 65 ballots were found, the county canvass was continuing, and those ballots could have easily been counted. That would have required the City Clerk to take the urgent action that the situation demanded.” 
“Instead, she went on vacation and, per her testimony, never inquired about them again until mid-December,” the report continues. “There was nobody who took responsibility for these ballots. It was always someone else’s job. Rather than acknowledge these significant errors, the City Clerk and her staff either ignored the issue or willfully refused to inform the necessary parties and seek assistance. These actions resulted in nearly 200 lawful voters’ votes going uncounted – an unconscionable result.  This profound failure undermines public confidence in elections.”
The report found that Witzel-Behl potentially violated state law by abusing her discretion to run Madison’s elections, printing the pollbooks too early, failing to maintain records on the handling of absentee ballots, failing to properly oversee the staff responsible for counting the absentee ballots and failing to inform the city’s board of canvassers about the missing ballots. 
“It was the job of the City Clerk to immediately take action once notified about the found ballots, and she did nothing,” the report states. “It was the responsibility of the Deputy Clerk to take action in her absence, and he did nothing.  These ballots were treated as unimportant and a reconciliation nuisance, rather than as the essential part of our democracy they represent.”
If the report is approved by WEC, it will require Madison to certify it has taken a number of actions to correct the problems from November. Those requirements include developing an internal plan delineating which employee is responsible for statutorily required tasks, printing poll books no earlier than the Thursday before elections, changing the absentee ballot processing system so bags and envelopes aren’t lost, updating instructional materials for poll workers and completing a full inspection of all materials before the scheduled board of canvassers meeting after an election. 
WEC is scheduled to vote on the report’s findings at its July 17 meeting.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – State senators in the interim will take a look at sports betting, removing elected officials and the use of goats to eradicate red cedar trees.
Those are just a few of the 74 Senate interim study requests Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, recently assigned to committees. The studies, which can help shape legislative priorities, are expected to be completed by Oct. 31.
“These studies allow us to engage with subject matter experts, agency officials, industry leaders and everyday Oklahomans to gather a full range of perspectives,” Paxton said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, is expected to announce by July 25 which of the 154 interim study requests he has approved, said Jennifer Monies, a spokeswoman.
For years, lawmakers have filed bills seeking to allow sports betting in the state, but none have secured approval.
Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, is sponsoring a study on the issue.
He said it will get all the parties in the room to discuss why Oklahoma is among 11 states that hasn’t legalized it, and what can be done to get it passed and implemented.
“I think for Oklahoma, we have 38 tribes that have a say in it,” Coleman said. “Getting 38 anythings on the same page is not easy.”
Coleman is also sponsoring a study looking at how voters can remove statewide elected officials, lawmakers and county officials from office.
Currently, the only way to remove a statewide elected official is impeachment, Coleman said.
Coleman was the author of Senate Bill 990, which was expected to be the vehicle to set up the process that Oklahomans could use to remove someone from office independent of legislative involvement. 
Coleman said he didn’t move the measure forward because he realized there needed to be an interim study.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, has an interim study looking at why insurance rates in Oklahoma are so high, even when compared to states with similar dangerous weather events.
She said the study will look at factors beyond weather that contribute to the prices.
Seniors living on a fixed income are especially impacted, she said.
Meanwhile, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, has a study to look at the possibility of eliminating property taxes.
He did not respond to a request for comment.  
A Senate panel will study how to eradicate red cedar trees, which consume a lot of water and are a fire hazard.
“They have been using goats for several years in California in the canyons to take care of brush,” said Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, who requested the study.
Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, will be taking a look at how to improve the state’s food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, has a study looking at the nutritional value of food consumers can buy with food stamps. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, as part his of Make Oklahoma Healthy Again campaign, has asked the federal government to approve a request that bans food stamp recipients from using the program to buy soda and candy. 
At least two state senators, Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, and Aaron Reinhardt, R-Jenks, want to look at ways to make school lunch program offerings more nutritious.
Lawmakers in February return to the Capitol for the legislative session.

Last year's auction helped contribute to a big spike starting in June.,"New Jersey's grid operator is hosting a new auction that could affect future utility rates. Last year's auction helped contribute to a big spike starting in June. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)As the company that operates New Jersey’s grid begins a new electricity auction that will help set rates for future utility bills, a group of House members say they want to avoid a repeat of last year’s auction results that led to skyrocketing electric prices this summer.
A new letter to grid operator PJM Interconnection signed by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) asks the company’s president, Manu Asthana, to describe what PJM is doing to avoid more “unnecessary cost burdens on ratepayers” and how his company is improving transparency as it launches the new auction.
“Our aim is to gain a better understanding of the steps PJM is taking to ensure that the millions of families and seniors that fall within PJM’s region do not face yet another price hike in their electricity bills,” Gottheimer and nine other members of Congress wrote.
PJM is the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states.
In New Jersey, utilities annually buy electricity supply through auctions like the one PJM is hosting starting Wednesday (it ends July 15, with results public on July 22). Its July 2024 auction saw electric capacity prices reach record totals, increasing by more than 800% over the previous year, an increase that helped contribute to skyrocketing electric bills New Jersey customers saw starting last month.
PJM said the higher totals were the result of an imbalance between electricity supply and demand. New Jersey Democrats like Gov. Phil Murphy have criticized PJM by saying it is too slow to add renewable projects to its grid, projects that the Democrats say would help lower customers’ bills.
The House members’ letter says they want to know how PJM is ensuring sufficient capacity amid rising electrification and increasing demand for power-hungry data centers.
In June, a group of New Jersey lawmakers announced a package of bills they said would help modernize the state’s electric grid and stabilize rates. One legislator suggested that without major reforms, New Jersey should consider working with another regional transmission company.
In April, Murphy urged Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials to investigate whether the 2024 auction was “subject to market manipulation.” The state Board of Public Utilities has also blamed the “flawed market dynamics in the PJM region” for increasing costs.
Republicans have pointed fingers at Murphy’s energy policies, saying he was too focused on failed wind energy projects.
Last month, in response to spiking utility bills, the Board of Public Utilities approved a plan to defer $60 from customers’ summer bills and extend $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers.

(Getty Images)A Central Kentucky measles outbreak has now spread to nine cases, according to the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department. 
The department posted to Facebook on Tuesday that the five new measles cases in Fayette County are all “household contacts of the first” case in the county. The patients have all been in quarantine, the health department said, and the public is not thought to be at risk. 
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
Vaccinations have declined recently even as the United States is facing an outbreak larger than any since measles “was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000,” the Cabinet for Health and Family Services previously said.  
An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases, according to the CDC. There have been 27 outbreaks in the country this year and three  people have died. As of July 8, 39 jurisdictions in the country have reported a total of 1,288 confirmed measles cases to the CDC. 
Kentucky’s 2025 measles timeline 
So far in 2025, the state has reported these measles cases:

In February, an adult was diagnosed with measles after traveling internationally. This was the first case in a Kentuckian since 2023. 
In March, an unvaccinated child traveling through Kentucky had measles. The child was treated and did not expose others. 
On June 27, the cabinet reported four new cases of measles in unvaccinated Kentuckians. Three of the four cases were from the same household in Woodford County. The fourth, unrelated to the others, is a Todd County person who was exposed while traveling internationally. 
On June 30, the cabinet announced that the “measles outbreak that started in Woodford County has spread to Fayette County.” The Fayette County case was also in an unvaccinated individual, a cabinet spokeswoman said. 
On July 8, the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department announced five new cases related to the outbreak, bringing the total number of Kentucky cases in 2025 to 12.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1196157315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 16:15:58.648889

(Getty Images)Motorcyclists in West Virginia can now stand up while driving their vehicle as a new state law went into effect on Wednesday.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the Republican-sponsored legislation, which was called a “freedom from leg cramps bill” by co-sponsor Del. Chris Phillips, R-Barbour as the House of Delegates signed off on it earlier this year. 
The new law permits riders to operate a motorcycle or moped while standing as long as the rider is facing forward with their feet on the pedals. It was banned under state law.
Bill sponsors said that motorcyclists were instructed to stand up in certain situations as part of their required instruction to obtain a motorcycle license. 
“Standing up on the foot pegs just gives you so much more control when a bump is coming up. Your legs act like shock absorbers,” said Sen. Mark Maynard, R-Wayne, in April during bill debate. “This is just heinous that if somebody does this, they would be ticketed.”
According to Phillips, citations had been issued for motorcyclists who weren’t seated while driving. 
The bill promoted backlash from several Democratic lawmakers, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Woelfel called it the “Organ Donor Act of 2025.” Woelfel, D-Cabell, questioned why lawmakers were advancing the bill with “all the issues we have in our state.”
In the House, Del. Shawn Fluharty’s reaction to the bill spurred a viral video showing the Democrat from Ohio County yelling, “Vroom! Vroom! West Virginia,” before criticizing the Republican-backed bill, saying it was unnecessary and did nothing to help residents of the state. 
House members voted down an amendment to the bill that would have also removed the helmet requirement for motorcyclists over age 21. Current state law requires all motorcyclists to wear protective headgear, regardless of age.

Dixon posted a lengthy statement on social media Wednesday noting her decision to not seek either office in the upcoming election cycle. She was rumored to be interested in seeking the Republican nomination for both positions, which will be decided by voters during the August 2026 primary.
The former nominee name-dropped President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in her explanation of why she would not run for governor again or to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield), saying the pair was “saving America” with policies that she said were having positive effects.

Dixon said her focus was on “protecting and advancing those policies.” That also means voters won’t see her name on primary ballots for either position come August 2026.
“I will continue traveling our great state to support Trump polices and the candidates authentically embracing them,” Dixon said. “President Trump’s drive to save our country and be the voice for working people is remarkable. I want to do my part to ensure his America First policies are cornerstones beyond 2028.”
Dixon currently hosts The Tudor Dixon Podcast and was previously a conservative news personality before running for governor in 2022. Dixon was one of 10 initial candidates seeking her party’s nomination in the last gubernatorial cycle, but she quickly became the favorite and won the primary after five of the candidates were booted from the ballot over fraudulent signature petitions.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She secured the backing of President Donald Trump days before the 2022 primary election and leveraged that support throughout the general election. But Dixon’s campaign had a tough start and her campaign never solidified into the kind of machine that was necessary to best the incumbent Whitmer, who sailed comfortably to victory in the November 2022 general election.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Federal officials must take action to allow cellphone jamming in prisons, state grand juries said in a pair of reports published Wednesday, pointing to the number of cases involving inmates using cellphones to commit crimes.
For years, state officials have called for a change in federal rules that would let state prisons block all cell signals, which is currently allowed only in federal prisons. Contraband cellphones allow inmates to continue conducting criminal operations outside prison walls, officials have said.
New SC law aims to reduce crimes inmates arrange with cellphones

It’s the first time any state grand jury, which is tasked with hearing complex criminal cases that cross county lines, has issued a report in a least a decade. Composed of 18 citizens each, the two juries, which overlapped in service by a year, represent the “conscience of the community,” said Creighton Waters, who oversees the grand jury.
“Jamming the cell phone communication of State inmates would immediately eliminate so much of the criminal activities within our State prisons,” both grand jury statements read. “Each day that goes by without change results in the lost and ruined lives caused by the criminal enterprises.”
The jurors were “incensed” after repeatedly signing off on indictments for inmates allegedly using cellphones to continue committing crimes, Waters said.
For instance, two prisoners were convicted last month of trafficking methamphetamine from prison, which they were able to arrange through illegal cellphones. The two received life sentences without parole, said state Attorney General Alan Wilson.
In a separate investigation, a woman pleaded guilty to sexually abusing her young daughter, claiming it was at her boyfriend’s instruction from prison. Her boyfriend has been charged with criminal sexual conduct and sexual exploitation of a minor and is awaiting trial, Wilson said.
Another inmate was recently charged with trafficking marijuana, money laundering and intimidating witnesses, all allegedly orchestrated by cellphone from prison, Wilson said.
Those cases underscore the seriousness of the crimes inmates can commit when they have access to illicit cellphones, said Pickens County Sheriff Tommy Blankenship, whose department worked with state prosecutors on several of the cases.
“I have watched the men and women of my agency sacrifice and take risks to protect the citizens of Pickens County only for those individuals to continue to be a threat to my citizens while behind bars,” Blankenship said.

The state Attorney General’s Office will go after any inmate found to have contraband cellphones, but there’s only so much of a difference attorneys can make when the punishment is to keep prisoners in the same place where they were able to commit the crimes before, Wilson said.
“Locking someone up doesn’t make us safer as long as we have access to cellphones behind prison walls,” Wilson said.
Over the past two years, the Legislature has sent the Department of Corrections more than $18 million to put toward stopping cellphone use in prisons. The agency installed a system in 2023 that identifies phones making calls within prisons, allowing correction officials to report the phones to the carriers supporting them and get them shut off for good.
Wilson likened the system to a game of “Whac-A-Mole,” since officials have to identify each phone coming online in order to shut them off.
That system, which has been installed at six of the state’s 21 prisons, stops between 75% and 80% of all cellphone use. The system is better than nothing, but it’s not as effective as cutting off cellphone service at the source the way jamming signals would, said Joel Anderson, director of the corrections department.
“You’re basically just managing a problem, not eliminating it,” Anderson said.
Allowing cellphone jamming would require a change in federal communications law.
Despite bipartisan pushes for years to do just that, officials feel like they’re “yelling into a wind tunnel” trying to get any changes made, Wilson said. Federal legislation has made no movement over cellphone companies’ concerns that signal jamming could bleed into areas outside prisons. State officials have repeatedly dismissed that as a non-issue, pointing to tests that show otherwise.
“You need to get your head out of your backside and do this now,” Wilson said, addressing federal officials. “It’s time.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_3096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 16:15:58.648889

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Public Service Commission won’t reconsider its decision on Rocky Mountain Power’s rate increase request, with commissioners saying they were offended by how the state’s largest utility worded its review request.
Arguing that Utah ratepayers shouldn’t bear other states’ costs, the commission ordered a 4.7% electricity residential rate increase in April, only about a quarter of the 18.1% Rocky Mountain Power requested last August, and even less than the initial 30% proposal that upset Utah elected officials.  
The company requested reconsideration of that decision in May, calling it “shortsighted” and arguing the commission’s order “improperly denies the Company recovery of prudently incurred expenses” and reached conclusions that were unsupported or contradicted by evidence, compromising the utility’s financial stability and its ability to invest in the state. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Describing the tone of Rocky Mountain Power’s request as “hyperbolic, intemperate, and occasionally disrespectful,” the commission rejected the utility’s argument that the April order didn’t cite evidence for many of its conclusions. 
Rocky Mountain Power requests rehearing on partial electricity rate hike, calls order ‘shortsighted’

In the order issued on Thursday, commissioners also claimed that by using that language, the company “impugns the integrity” of the Public Service Commission, insinuating that the order seemed to be outcome-motivated “‘under the guise’ of controlling costs.”
“This offensive characterization is untrue, unhelpful in what has been a careful deliberative process, and the PSC is disappointed that RMP would stoop to what can be construed as an attack on the impartiality and integrity of the PSC,” the commission wrote. 
After the denial, which was partially posted on June 26, the utility filed an appeal petition to the Utah Supreme Court, said David Eskelsen, Rocky Mountain Power spokesperson.
“We intend to avail ourselves of the full appeal process,” Eskelsen said. “We believe that our original request as it was revised in August last year, was prudent and reasonable.”
However, the commissioners believe the tone of the company’s request may be frowned upon by the courts. Additionally, they say some of the decisions Rocky Mountain Power is contesting, like the commission’s rejection of the company’s wildfire mitigation plan, could have been reviewed in other ways if Rocky Mountain Power had provided meaningful evidence about the cost-effectiveness of the plan. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The state and its regulatory agencies have shared a history of collaboration with Rocky Mountain Power, but that doesn’t “require Utahns to tolerate unfairness,” the commission said.
“Utah customers are not RMP’s guarantor of last resort for skyrocketing and imprudent costs that RMP incurs to protect its shareholders from policies and events arising in other states.”
An ‘appropriate’ response
Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, the state’s utility consumer advocate and one of the parties intervening in the rate increase case, described the paragraphs the commission wrote addressing Rocky Mountain Power’s request language as “very appropriate,” since the company’s application was “baffling,” “counterproductive, disappointing and, frankly, offensive.”
“They’re not just any old corporation. They provide us an essential service. And regulation is a substitute for competition and making sure that the terms and conditions are fair and appropriate,” Beck said. “So I very strongly agree with the commission’s comments on the tone, and I really hope that we can get past this, because in the end, this is about serving customers.”
The exchange between the company and the commission is unusual, Beck said, because taking such a tone is against the company’s interests.
“The utility needs to be concentrating on supporting their positions, on explaining why what they want to do is in the public interest,” she said. “And if they don’t even try to do that explanation, and if instead they revert simply to attacks, it does call into question, are they trying to do what’s in the public interest?”
For Beck, the commission’s order was good overall and impressively well-supported. One key element of the order was the commission holding Rocky Mountain Power to its burden of proof, she said.
“To me, Rocky Mountain Power should take a different lesson. They should say, ‘OK, we need to change our approach,’” she said. “And maybe they come back in and we find, ‘yes, it’s in the public interest to do more or different investments,’ but it’s not going to be a blank check for them.”

District employees have gone over budget on the construction of a new middle school and used federal dollars to buy furniture. Some purchases appear to be made without the county board approval, which is required under state code.

“Was everybody asleep at the wheel in Roane County?” asked Paul Hardesty, a state school board member. “You guys are hemorrhaging cash.”
Earlier this year, the county received a $402,225 advance on their June allocation of the state aid formula to make payroll.
Roane school leaders this week requested another financial advance of more than $300,000 to cover expenses. 
  Gregory Wooten
“You guys are bankrupt. You’re absolutely bankrupt,” board member Gregory Wooten said. 
The West Virginia Board of Education declared a state of emergency for Roane County Schools on Wednesday, adding to the growing list of counties now under board control or in a state of emergency.
Declining student enrollment was also cited as a reason that the district should be under a state emergency and develop a plan to correct the problems.
Michelle Stallato is the new county superintendent, just five days on the job. She stood before board members, pledging to fix the problems and do what’s best for children. 
“We are going in with eyes wide open. I have an amazing staff that are willing to do the work,” she said. “We understand it’s going to be very unpopular. We understand we’re going to have to make very difficult decisions.”
County didn’t cut positions while student enrollment declined 
A report from the West Virginia Department of Education showed that in October 2024, Roane County Schools employed more than 16 teaching and service positions over the funding formula.
“It’s projected we didn’t make enough cuts into this year and that deficit will grow,” Stallato said.
The county overspent $600,000 on special education in the current fiscal year due to improper budgeting, the report said, linking the problem to “inaccuracies in data certified by Roane County Schools.”
The state education department also found that Roane County Schools initially purchased furniture with dollars from multiple federal programs, which were unaccounted for in the budgets for those programs.
Roane County serves a little more than 1,600 students. Like many West Virginia school districts, the county is dealing with a declining student population due to the state’s overall population loss and students opting to use the state’s voucher program — the Hope Scholarship — for private schooling or other options. 
The district operates on a yearly budget of $27 million. The school system had close to a $2 million budget surplus in 2021; now there’s a projected $2.5 million deficit. 
Jeff Mace, president of the Roane County School Board, said they’re pushing for more transparency in budgeting and forecasting. 
“We were not completely aware of the magnitude of where we’re at, even as recent as this current budget preparation,” he said. “The board understands … the current position now.”
Last month, the state school board took over Boone County Schools because of multiple issues in the system, including potential conflict of interest and potentially using board of education resources to maintain property.
The board also declared a state of emergency in Randolph County Schools for six months due to financial concerns, tasking the county with creating a balanced budget. The district is grappling with declining enrollment and aging facilities, which contributed to the financial issues. 
On Wednesday, board members selected Hardesty to serve as president, replacing current President Nancy White who said she wasn’t going to seek reelection. Hardesty is a former state lawmaker and Logan County school board member. He has previously served as board president.
“I am humbled by the support and confidence that my fellow board members have placed in me,” Hardesty said. “This board faces many challenges this upcoming year. We will face those challenges head on, with the purposes of doing what is in the best interests of our 241,000 students across the state.”

Josh Elliott: ‘Welcome to the race’,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/josh-elliott-ned-lamont-reaction/,"Rep. Josh Elliott said he will measure success by how he shapes the party’s agenda, not by whether he can win a challenge against Gov. Lamont.","On his first full day as a candidate for governor, liberal state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, promised a campaign to force the Democratic Party to reassess its identity and sharpen a vision that he says has grown blurry under Gov. Ned Lamont, a self-described fiscal centrist weighing a run for a third term in 2026. 
“This is a fight for the soul of the party,” Elliott said in an interview Wednesday. “Primaries and convention fights are meant to suss out what the party wants to do and what the vision is. So, for the next year, we’re going to have a conversation about the direction of the party and vision for the state.”
Elliott, who filed papers creating a candidate committee Tuesday without an announcement, said he will measure success by how he shapes the party’s agenda, not necessarily by whether he can win a challenge against a popular governor who promises to announce his 2026 plans no later than early fall.
“That to me is the win. The win is being in the race,” Elliott said.
In a brief interview Wednesday morning before going on air at WNPR for a previously scheduled appearance on “The Wheelhouse,” the governor welcomed Elliott to a contest he has yet to formally enter.
“Look, he’s a good guy,” Lamont said. “Welcome to the race.”
Elliott’s campaign is unlikely to change his own timetable for announcing whether he will run again, Lamont said.
“I do my thing,” he said.
On air, Lamont reiterated what he said the day after the legislative session ended in June: He and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz are seriously considering a third term.
“We have a lot of unfinished business,” Lamont said.
Lamont’s insistence on using surplus funds to pay down debt and build budget reserves, combined with a refusal to entertain any hike of income tax rates, including the bump on high earners long sought by unions and advocates of increased spending on social services, has been a consistent source of friction with elements of the Democratic coalition.
More recently, his vetoes of an omnibus housing bill and of a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers have drawn public criticism from the Connecticut AFL-CIO — as well as reminders by Lamont of a labor-friendly record that includes a higher minimum wage, a nearly universal mandate on private employers to offer sick days, a paid family and medical leave program, expanded collective bargaining rights and, more recently, creation of a trust fund to eventually provide free or subsidized child care, depending on income.
“I think we agree on 90% of the stuff,” Lamont said. “You can get really angry about the 10% where we don’t necessarily agree, but, look, we’ve had a very progressive agenda. We’ve been working very closely together.”
“He’s not wrong, but he’s missing so much,” Elliott said. 
It’s not just what he has or hasn’t done in his first 6 1/2 years in office, he said.
“He doesn’t have what Connecticut needs for the next four,” Elliott said. “We have a housing crisis he blithely ignores, and he is so focused on the state budget he ignores the fact that people’s property taxes are skyrocketing. CCM is screaming about this.”
CCM is the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
Elliott, 40, arrived at the state Capitol in January 2017 as a disrupter, a young liberal with short spiky hair who had challenged House Speaker J. Brendan Sharkey for the Democratic nomination in the 88th House District of Hamden. He won after Sharkey did not run, then promised to help weed out colleagues he deemed insufficiently progressive or bold.
“I’m not here to make friends,” Elliott said then. “I think I’m very easy to work with, but I think I have exacting standards, and I’m not holding anybody to higher standards than I hold myself to.”
He quizzed his House Democratic colleagues on 25 progressive issues, including a higher minimum wage, paid family and medical leave, higher taxes on the wealthy, fees on larger employers whose employees rely on the state for health and other assistance, and legalizing recreational marijuana.

Elliott became less confrontational within his own caucus, seeking allies on favored legislation such the legalization of recreational cannabis and free phone calls for the incarcerated. He now has the trusted role of overseeing bill screening, making him an important, if behind-the-scenes, player in getting legislation to a floor vote.
“I’m a party man,” he said Wednesday, laughing.
To that end, he will draw differences with the 71-year-old Lamont and try to push the party — and potentially Lamont — in a more progressive direction but not demonize a governor who might once more end up as the Democratic nominee, Elliott said.
“The goal is not to dirty Ned to the point where he can’t win,” Elliott said.
In 2022, Elliott ran for secretary of the state, pushing issues like voting rights for the incarcerated, early voting and ranked choice voting. “I was able to use that year of campaigning to change the hearts and minds of our party,” Elliott said.
Early voting is now state law, and the governor is among the Democrats supportive of ranked choice voting.
Elliott stayed in the secretary of the state’s race until the state nomination convention, where delegates did not give him sufficient support for a primary, then he fell back to a campaign for reelection to the House.
Elliott, who plans a formal campaign kickoff at 1 p.m. Monday outside Hamden town hall, said labor activists unhappy with Lamont have made no commitment to him. 
There are few templates for denying a nomination to a statewide incumbent in Connecticut, but Lamont is more familiar than most with what’s required: primarily, a compelling reason to reject someone.
In 2006, Lamont was a largely unknown businessman opposed to the war in Iraq and U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman’s role as a cheerleader for President George W. Bush and his decision to invade Iraq. He challenged Lieberman for the Democratic nomination, winning the primary — but losing when Lieberman continued as a petitioning candidate in the general election.
“Nobody ever asked why I was running against Joe Lieberman. Nobody ever had to ask that,” Lamont said Wednesday.
Did he appreciate the irony that his example now might inspire challenges to him?
He smiled thinly and said, “I’ve been made aware of that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7990-1024x604.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 16:15:58.648889

Here’s what it means for your family,Chabeli Carrazana | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/09/the-child-tax-credit-is-changing-what-it-means/,"A new child tax credit is coming, bringing changes that will alter how much assistance families receive and which families can receive it.","A new child tax credit is coming next year, bringing significant changes that will alter how much assistance families receive — and which families can receive it.
With his tax and spending package, President Donald Trump passed a permanent change to the child tax credit spearheaded by congressional Republicans. It goes into effect for families filing income tax returns in 2026. 
The changes increase the total amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and index it to inflation so it grows over the years, a change advocates have championed for years. However, the package also introduces new parameters to qualify for the credit that will directly affect immigrants and the lowest-income families.
For the first time, children and at least one of their parents or guardians will have to have a Social Security number to be able to qualify for the child tax credit. That means an estimated 2.7 million American kids who likely qualify for the credit this year will no longer be able to get it as of next year. 
The tax credit was passed in 1997. Families have used it to help cover basic needs like food and also wants, like getting their children into extracurricular activities. 
But for its nearly 30-year history, the credit has been structured in a way that families with the lowest incomes couldn’t get the full amount. With the most recent change, and because the credit phases in depending on income and the number of children you have, families have to earn more before they can claim the full amount.
Democrats had been pushing to change those requirements in recent years so that the lowest-income families could get more of the credit, but Republicans pushed back, saying it disincentivized people to work. 
Under the new child tax credit, an estimated 19 million children are now blocked from receiving the full amount, compared with 17 million currently, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, which has done much of the research and analysis on the child tax credit. The share of children from marginalized backgrounds who are not going to be able to receive the full amount has also gone up for each group:

48% of American Indian or Alaska Native children (from 45% under the current law)
45% of Black children (from 41%)
39% of Latinx children (from 34%)
60% of children of single mothers (from 55%)
35% of children in rural parts of the country (from 30%)

“Families of all sizes are going to need higher levels of income to be eligible for the full credit amount,” said Christopher Yera, a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child tax credit is being cut at a time when other vital services for low-income Americans are seeing reduction.
Under the same tax package, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is losing $186 billion in funding through 2034, affecting eligibility for free school meals and for families that rely on the assistance to put food on the table. Another $1 trillion will be cut from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the next decade. 
“All these families that are going to lose access to basic needs, it would be handy if the folks harmed by that were actually reached by the child tax credit,” said Meredith Dodson, the senior director of public policy for the Coalition on Human Needs who has been lobbying for an expansion of the credit.
Here is a breakdown of how the new child tax credit works and how to access it: 
What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a return parents and guardians receive in their taxes annually for every child under the age of 17 in their care. Stepchildren, foster children, half siblings and descendants, including grandchildren and nieces or nephews, may also qualify if the tax filer is their main caretaker.
Since 2017, the most families could claim from the credit is $2,000 per child, and that amount goes down after a certain threshold. 
Guardians who earn very little or nothing have never been able to claim the full amount of the credit except for in 2021, when it temporarily expanded during the pandemic.
What is the new child tax credit amount? 
For the 2025 tax filing year, the child tax credit will increase to $2,200. Eligible parents will see this amount in their tax returns next year. 
The credit will also be adjusted annually to account for inflation beginning in 2026.
Who qualifies for the new child tax credit? 
If filing a single return, parents and guardians must have a Social Security number to access the credit. This is a significant departure from prior years when only the children, but not the adults claiming them, had to have a Social Security number. 
For parents and guardians who are filing jointly, only one parent has to have a Social Security number to qualify. That means some mixed-status households will be able to qualify for the credit. 
To be able to claim a child, the child has to have: 

Lived with the parent or caregiver for at least six months during 2025 (though there are some exceptions)
Lived six months or more in the United States
Have a Social Security number

The shift is part of a years-long effort to limit immigrants’ access to government services. Before 2017, any child living in the United States was eligible for the child tax credit. Then Trump’s tax cuts package in 2017 changed that rule to require that the child have a Social Security number to qualify. Their parents could use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, to file their taxes and still be eligible for the credit. Now at least one of those parents will need to also have a Social Security number. 
Families headed by an undocumented single parent, where the child is an American citizen, will not get the child tax credit at all. 
“Instead of actually expanding the [child tax credit], they took it away from millions of kids,” Dodson said. “There are important changes [in the law] but they kind of miss the mark when the whole thing is leaving out the folks who need it the most.”
Does everyone who qualifies get $2,200? 
No. Families who earn less than $2,500 a year do not receive anything. After that, the credit begins to phase in depending on how much families earn. (Keep reading for exact figures)
Some families earn little and owe no taxes. Those families are eligible for only a portion of the child tax credit, up to $1,700 in 2025. That means that even if your tax liability is zero, you can still receive a check for up to $1,700 for the child tax credit.
Then, the credit starts to phase out once families earn too much to qualify for the full amount. For a single filer, the credit starts to decrease for any amount they earn past $200,000; for joint filers the threshold is $400,000. Caregivers earning more than $240,000 for a single filer and $440,000 for joint filers do not receive anything. 
What is the minimum you need to earn to qualify for the full amount? 
According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University: 

Families with one child: A single filer needs to earn at least $28,700; joint filers need to earn at least $36,500. 
Families with two children: A single filer needs to earn at least $33,700; joint filers need to earn at least $41,500.
Families with three children: A single filer needs to earn at least $38,700; joint filers need to earn at least $46,500. 
Families with four children: A single filer needs to earn at least $45,800; joint filers need to earn at least $51,500. 

Who doesn’t qualify? 
Children who don’t have a Social Security number don’t qualify. Single parents or guardians who don’t have a Social Security number also don’t qualify, even if the child does have a Social Security number. 
An estimated 28% of children will not qualify for the full amount because their parents earn too little. That is up from 25% previously, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Policy at Columbia. The share of kids who are ineligible because their parents earn too much stays the same, at 4%.
The states with the largest share of children who don’t qualify for the full amount are Mississippi (40.6%), Louisiana (38.2%), New Mexico (38.2%), Alabama (35.1%) and Kentucky (34.9%). 
How do you claim the credit in your taxes? 
Filers must include their children or dependents on Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return, and also complete a Schedule 8812.
Is this like the child tax credit in 2021? 
No. In 2021, that credit was expanded to give families up to $3,600, much of it in the form of monthly checks, instead of an annual lump sum. The 2021 expansion allowed the poorest families in the country, those who don’t file income taxes, to access the child tax credit for the first time in its history. Those pandemic-era changes cut the child poverty rate in 2021 to a historic low of 5.2%. 
But the temporary changes lasted only a year, and an effort by Democrats to make them permanent failed. The tax credit then reverted back to its usual amount — $2,000 — and the child poverty rate rose to 12.4% in 2022.
Is this a temporary change or a permanent one? 
This is a permanent change. Previous child tax credit expansions have been in place for a set number of years and when it was time for those changes to expire, lawmakers renegotiated the new parameters. 
That is why the child tax credit came up this year — changes put in place in 2017 were set to expire in 2025. 
What the new version does differently is make the changes permanent. Lawmakers can still tweak the credit if they want to later, but there is no set date where the changes will end and the credit will revert back to a former amount.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25185821873536-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 16:15:58.648889

Daniel Grossberg, D-Louisville, speaks on the Kentucky House floor, Feb, 15, 2024. (LRC Public Information)The Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission has found “probable cause” that Rep. Daniel Grossberg, a Louisville Democrat accused of inappropriate behavior toward women, committed ethics violations, clearing the way for the first public airing of the charges against him. 
The commission’s votes came after a closed-door hours-long meeting last month which included appearances by Grossberg and his lawyers, women who work in politics and workers from a Louisville strip club. 
During a Tuesday meeting, commission members voted to find “probable cause” that the lawmaker violated the state ethics code in three ways: relating “intimidating statements or actions toward a private business,” “attempts to obtain contributions in exchange for possible state catering vendor business for a private company,” and an interaction with an individual in Grossberg’s Capitol Annex office before and after a July 2023 committee meeting “involving inappropriate treatment of that person.” 
The commission met in an executive session before votes were cast. 
The commission may now hold a public adjudicatory hearing. After the votes, commission Chairman David Nicholas told Grossberg and his attorneys that he may file an agreed settlement in the case. 
Thomas E. Clay, one of Grossberg’s lawyers, told the Kentucky Lantern Wednesday afternoon that the commission had not yet notified him of when the public hearing might be. He said he was “somewhat surprised” by the scope of the hearings because the commission had offered a settlement order based on only some of the allegations listed in the probable cause decision.
“So now, they’ve referred these other charges for full blown hearing, and I find that somewhat contradictory,” Clay said. 
Grossberg has been expelled from the House Democratic Caucus and faces calls from within his party to resign his legislative seat. The allegations that he behaved inappropriately toward women came to light last year in reporting reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader. In a separate investigation, the Legislative Research Commission questioned women about inappropriate text messages sent to them by Grossberg. Later, the strip club, Foxys Gentlemen’s Club, told the Herald-Leader it banned Grossberg for life after he inappropriately touched a dancer.
Before the June hearing, Grossberg had attempted to sway Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate to block the proceeding, but Wingate dismissed the motion. However, the case is still pending. 
House Democrats sought the investigation by the Legislative Ethics Commission. What exactly is in the complaint against Grossberg, as well as any investigation findings, are not publicly known though some details have been reported by media outlets. Kentucky law makes the ethics commission’s proceedings, including complaints and other records related to a preliminary inquiry, confidential until the commission makes a final determination.
Grossberg represents the 30th House District, which includes central parts of Jefferson County. He has gained some primary challengers for the 2026 election.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/grossberg021524-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 16:15:58.648889

​​Deadly floods in Texas last week have left at least 111 people dead, with more than 160 still missing.
The media and experts are discussing what kinds of alerts made it to those in harm’s way, and whether something different would have saved more lives.
And that made us wonder: What do weather alerts look like here in Michigan?
 Lots of moving parts

Patrick Bak, a warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gaylord, said the weather service has a few different ways to alert people in an emergency.
The state of Michigan has more information about emergency alerts in the state.
Wireless Emergency Alerts: These look like text messages and have a specific sound and vibration when they’re received.
Emergency Alert System: This is run through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in partnership with the National Weather Service and other agencies. Bak said the Emergency Alert System is a way for broadcast companies to work with various agencies to get out alert messages through broadcasters, cable TV, and satellite providers. (You may hear those being tested from time to time on IPR.)
The National Weather Service can trigger those locally to include weather events such as tornado warnings, severe thunderstorm warnings, or flash flood warnings.
NOAA Weather Radio: The aptly named Weather Radio is run through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and broadcasts continuous weather information from the nearest Weather Service office on radio frequencies around the country.
Local coordination: Counties also have their own systems for getting information out to people. Depending on where you live, you may have to opt in, so it’s worth checking out how to do that in your area. The state has info on how to sign up.
 How it works here

One example of extreme weather in northern Michigan is when a deadly tornado hit Gaylord in 2022. Bak said the Weather Service was issuing severe thunderstorm warnings when the storm first developed and moved on shore toward Frankfort.
“That complex kind of moved to the northeast, and it kind of went through an evolution, and then we issued a tornado warning as it was getting close to Otsego County,” he said.
One central concept is “lead time” — the time between when a warning is issued and when the weather hits an area. Faster moving systems like thunderstorms usually mean less time to warn people of what’s coming.
“You can’t get as much lead time because they’re very localized. And as far as the details, you can’t give that much information too early,” he said.
Bak framed this as a “balancing act,” where they worked to give people enough time to act while still forecasting an event accurately and avoiding “alert fatigue.”
 What can we do?

Bak said having multiple ways to get alerts and information will mean you’re more prepared.
A place with low cell service may not receive alerts on time, for instance. “If you had a weather radio with you, or you’re listening to a radio station, you might be able to get that alert that you wouldn’t be able to get over your phone in that particular instance,” he said. “By having more ways to receive, you have a better hope of receiving that alert.”
Finally, he said, it’s important to have a plan in case of severe weather.

There is an underground, goodwill synergy happening in North Idaho that is surrounding, caring and supporting Kootenai County firefighters and their families in the wake of the June 29 Canfield Mountain ambush and shootings.
That collaboration is focused on nourishment, and many hands are doing everything they can to keep firefighters and those close to them fed with love, care and food.
 All hands and hearts on deck

“We have been making meals for five different fire stations in the area; three meals a day, every day this past week and this week, too,” said fire-wife Dana Bellefeuille who co-owns The Village Bakery located in Hayden, Idaho, alongside her husband, Todd, a Spokane Valley firefighter for 16 years.
“We want to make sure our firefighters are taken care of, and they don’t have to worry about food,” she said.


Donations for The Village Bakery’s goodwill meal train for firefighters and their families can be dropped off at the store, mailed or sent through the bakery’s Venmo account on Facebook.


The Bellefeuilles’ bakery is functioning as a meal hub for this grassroots community effort, and the two of them have been laser-focused on this mission since Sunday, the afternoon of the shootings nearly 10 days ago.
“It’s senseless,” Bellefeuille said about the tragedy in her Coeur d’Alene hometown. “I heard about the incident and immediately put wheels in motion because I knew there was going to be needs. And we wanted to make sure those needs were met.”
 How the meal hub started

Bellefeuille and her husband immediately dropped what they were doing, she said, to come to the aid of their community initially making food for first responders and victims’ families impacted that night.
One North Idaho bakery defies earthly odds for the good of others

Without hesitation, she jumped on The Village Bakery Facebook page and put out a call to action to her followers to humbly lend a hand. Right away, people responded, and donations, supplies and helpers came flowing into the store’s doors offering goodwill and support.
Ever since, hands haven’t stopped chopping, wrapping and delivering meals. With over 100 volunteers, donated community funds and its bakery staff, The Village Bakery meal hub makes approximately 90 meals a day totaling 700 meals weekly for Kootenai County fire stations.
“This is the biggest meal train I have ever been a part of. It’s the most amazing thing!” Bellefeuille said in Village Bakery Facebook video.
 Other Idaho businesses start getting on board

Their heartful, caring initiative planted seeds that are now growing and supporting a daily meal train for area Kootenai firefighters. Volunteers keep showing up at the bakery door, donations keep pouring in and several community restaurants are partnering and supporting the meal train, too.
“I heard about her doing the meals for firefighters and families, and I reached out to her to offer our help,” said Teresa Capone, owner of Capone’s Pub and Grill. “We just wanted to help like everybody else when this happened.”
Capone had never met the Bellefeuilles, but in the past, they ordered cakes from the bakery.
Capone and her husband, Tom, have operated their Capone restaurants in the North Idaho area for over 34 years. They have close ties with many first responder groups in Kootenai County.
“It’s the connections. You are a big part of the community (as a restaurant owner),” she said. “This (the firefighter shootings) was personal for us.”

“About 11 a.m. last Saturday, Todd (Bellefeuille) of The Village Bakery walked in here, and he needed about 25 sandwiches made in 30 minutes for firefighters’ lunches,” Eggers said.
According to Eggers, this short order sandwich request didn’t rattle his staff.
“They jumped into high speed for him,” he said. “We always try to be the store that finds a way for people. They stepped up and came through for them.”
Eggers himself wasn’t there that day, but 22-year-old, four-year employee Connor Dremann was.
He’s a fourth generation Coeur d’Alene resident. He made the sandwiches himself.
“I was more than happy to help and make them,” Dremann said.
The shootings have had an impact on him personally, he said, having been born and raised in the community.
“For me, it’s heartbreaking. I feel for the families of the victims because I care about people here,” Dremann said. “I appreciate how we have come together as a community — working keeps my mind off things.”
 Free meals available in other ways

Bellefeuille offered kudos to other area businesses who continue to provide food and assistance to firefighters and the community meal train.
“The list is long,” she said. But she gave shout outs to Best Avenue Taco Works and Las Brasas Mexican Grill for being there to help. Both are examples of this community spirit of goodwill support, she said.
These two Mexican food truck restaurants also are giving back in creative ways with “pay-it-forward” gift cards where customer donations are collected real time, on site, for first responders. These monies then cover firefighter meal costs at their business locations.
“We’ve started a gift card and welcome customers to contribute, helping us continue to pay it forward. Our hearts and prayers are with the brothers and sisters who are grieving, and with the families who have lost their heroes,” said Las Brasas on their Facebook page, where they actively advertise their fundraiser for their locations in Post Falls and Coeur d’Alene.
Taco Works, an authentic Mexican food truck in Coeur d’Alene, offers the same program.
“We have a gift card that anyone can come and donate to, toward meals for our first responders,” they said on their Facebook page. We will use every cent of it to take care of food for all firefighters, EMS and law enforcement personnel that come by our location.”
 The meal train keeps on giving

The Kootenai meal train started by The Village Bakery, which FāVS recently featured, keeps moving along, giving back generously to those firefighters and families that need its services.
“It takes a village. We couldn’t have done any of this without our community,” Bellefeuille said. “The food has been very well received.”
When will the meal train stop?
Bellefeuille and her husband said they really don’t know when the meal train will make its last stop. For right now, they are just grateful and feel blessed to keep it on track if they can, she said.
“Thank you all for coming together,” Bellefeuille said. “We love you all.”

The Trump administration last week released its proposed NOAA budget for fiscal year 2026. The plan would close a dozen government research labs, including the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami which includes NOAA’s Hurricane Research Division and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which developed most of the improvement in hurricane forecast models.
  Screenshot of Robert Atlas showing a graph of how the accuracy of storm forecasts have improved over the years, on July 9, 2025.
Dr. Robert Atlas is former director of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML). He said that lab performs various functions critical to hurricane forecasting, such as hurricane-hunter flights for NOAA; processing Doppler radar data; innovating aerial drones; as well as launching ocean gliders that provide additional measures that help with intensity forecasting.
“The research that goes on at AOML is crucial to maintaining and improving the hurricane model forecast accuracy,” he said during a Zoom conference organized by South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Atlas said that AOML had created the HAFS (Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System) model that NOAA uses, and that “all of the improvements that we want to make to that model to increase accuracy even further and to extend the lead time on hurricane warnings and forecasts would not occur if AOML is eliminated.”
Loss of accuracy
Atlas produced a graphic showing constant improvements in the accuracy of hurricane intensity forecasting at NOAA over the years. Shutting down AOML would result in a 20%-40% loss of accuracy, he said, which would leave a billion-dollar impact on the country’s economy, as well as the potential loss of lives.
“Almost certainly by next year, some of the most important intensity models would fall out of service, degrading NHC’s intensity forecasts,” said James Franklin, former branch chief of the Hurricane Specialist Unit at the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
“The websites that provide forecasters with crucial satellite analysis would break. Intensity estimates for storms outside of aircraft range would be degraded, and the formation forecasts for disturbances would likely become less accurate.”
In the long term, Franklin said, track forecasts would continue to improve. He wasn’t as optimistic about the intensity forecast, however. “They would likely stagnate or even regress,” he said.
In addition to the proposed future cuts, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed on July 4 by President Trump includes $200 million in cuts to NOAA’s weather forecasting and public alert programs.
And Wasserman Schultz noted that $400 million allocated by Congress last December for hurricane-hunting aircraft and related expenses has already been rescinded by the Trump administration.
Cuts already enacted
Separate from the proposed cuts to NOAA are reduced staffing levels within the National Weather Service (NWS) that has been taking place ever since the Trump administration took office in January. Buyouts and early retirements offered to federal government workers through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to the NWS losing 600 of its approximately 4,200 staff. That’s according to Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization union, as reported by the BBC.
That’s had an effect already on weather forecasting. The Washington Post reported that for the month ending on May 26, 17% of all U.S. balloon launches that should have occurred had not, mostly because of NOAA staffing losses.










NOAA can do what our local and state governments simply cannot do — they use satellites, radar, aircraft, they track storms, and they issue watches and warnings coordinating with FEMA and our local officials.


– U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel


Palm Beach County Democratic U.S. Rep Lois Frankel served as mayor of West Palm Beach back in the aughts. She recounted how her city endured four major hurricanes during her tenure, adding that no lives were lost because the city had several days to prepare due to advanced warning from NOAA.
“NOAA can do what our local and state governments simply cannot do — they use satellites, radar, aircraft, they track storms, and they issue watches and warnings coordinating with FEMA and our local officials,” she said. “Because of those warnings, we were able to evacuate people early from the high-risk areas.”
She added that without that agency’s information, “we would have been flying blind.”
To illustrate the importance of accurate forecasting, Atlas said that when he first moved to South Florida he went to the Florida Keys and asked everyone he and his wife met whether they would evacuate if a Category 5 hurricane was forecast to hit the region, and every person said “no.”
“What was needed was the confidence in our hurricane forecasts,” he said. “And that’s what we’ve worked so hard for in NOAA research. Improving the accuracy means that people don’t get over-warned anywhere near as much. We want to increase it even further, so that people will take necessary actions and that people will evacuate. But the confidence levels increase tremendously as a result of the hurricane research. We don’t want to lose that by having our accuracy decrease.”

His departure touches off a national search for a successor. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Paul Wiedefeld, whom Gov. Wes Moore (D) once dubbed “the transportation leader we need at this moment,” will leave the job he has held since 2023 and trigger a search for a new state transportation secretary.
Wiedefeld, who turns 70 next month, is expected to leave the position Aug 1. He will be replaced — at least temporarily — by Deputy Secretary Samantha Biddle. A spokesperson for the governor confirmed that Moore will begin a national search for a new secretary.
Wiedefeld is the fourth Cabinet secretary to leave the Moore administration since January, and it comes at the same time as the departure of two other administration officials: Eric Luedtke, an adviser to the governor on budget and tax issues, is moving to the Department of Natural Resources, while Brad Fallon, a deputy legislative officer on Moore’s team, is heading to the Department of Housing and Community Development.
Wiedefeld’s step back from what he described in an interview Wednesday as a “24/7 job” won’t likely be an official retirement for the Towson resident. The secretary is currently the vice president of the Northeast Association of State Transportation officials. Next month he’ll become president of that organization.

“It’s definitely retirement from a 24/7 job,” he said. “There’s a number of things people talk to me about, universities, nonprofits, boards and consulting, to be frank, you know? So I’m very fortunate. I have different avenues there, if I want to pursue them, all or none.”
Biddle, a veteran of the department, came up through the State Highway Administration. She was tapped as chief of staff by Greg Slater when he was appointed transportation secretary by Gov. Larry Hogan. She remained in the position under Jim Ports, who succeeded Slater in 2022.
The state is set to begin a nationwide search for a new secretary that will be led by Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.
Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, said Miller, who has a background in transportation engineering, is the right choice to lead the search.
“Obviously, her expertise here is huge,” Harris said Wednesday. “Paul leaves really, really big shoes to fill.”
“He’s held every major transportation job, it seems, in the state and has always done a phenomenal job for the taxpayers,” Harris said. “I think in two and a half years he has reshaped MDOT in ways that are powerful and profound not just for now but for future generations.”
Among those accomplishments, Harris said, is the replacement of light rail cars and improved safety on the system, “pulling down $5 billion in federal funding and shoring up the Transportation Trust Fund.”
Harris added that it was the response to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge last year that showed him who Wiedefeld was. In the days that followed, Wiedefeld was tasked with protecting the state’s port economy, ushering a deal through Congress to replace the bridge and managing the response to the crisis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“So I think for me, that was the moment — seeing how despite all the heavy things that were on him,and despite the difficulty of the assignments, the many competing things that he needed to manage and figure out, that he has the wherewithal to show up (for the families of those who died) as a father, as a brother, to say I’m here with you and I understand,” Harris said.
“I think everyone knows his resume,” Harris said. “I think everyone knows he can execute, but there’s a humanity and a genuineness to him that is special.”
Harris said Wiedefeld’s decision was “telegraphed for a long time.”
Wiedefeld said he leaves the department not only with a renewed sense of the mission of the agency but with what he called “a deep bench” of senior level staff.
“There’s a bench there, deep bench, a very deep bench,” Wiedefeld said. “That is one thing that we worked on … we had to make some changes. Look across the board, we made some significant changes because we had to get to where we wanted to get. And I think we’re set there very well.”
Wiedefeld said he is confident the agency “won’t miss a beat” with Biddle serving as acting secretary.
Biddle, for her part, said she will throw her hat into the ring to succeed Wiedefeld.
“My heart has been fully rooted in public service, really, ever since I joined the department just about 11 years ago, and so it would be really hard for me to not pursue that wholeheartedly, just knowing how much public service has really shaped my career, shaped me as a person, and the ability to get to work with such an amazing team, amazing leadership as well,” Biddle said Wednesday.

“At the highest level, I am not deterred by any type of challenge,” she said. “I love to solve a problem, and I love to work with great people, so I look forward to the opportunity to continue in that in any way.”
The departure of Moore’s transportation secretary is one of three administration officials who are leaving their current roles.
Wiedefeld becomes the fourth member of Moore’s Cabinet to leave or be shown the door since January. His departure comes as the state juggles large projects, including the replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and Moore’s signature reboot of the Red Line in Baltimore.
Either project would be considered a legacy maker.
Wiedefeld said those are “big projects and exciting projects … but that’s not what’s driving that’s me.”
“There’s always be something like that, to be honest with you,” he said. “You know, every job I’ve had, whether it was at BWI [Baltimore-Washington International Airport], there was always something big right around the corner, whether it was that WMATA [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority], there was always something big right around the corner. There’s never an ideal time in that perspective.”
Moore praised Wiedefeld’s service in a statement Wednesday.
“Our state is grateful for Paul Weidefeld’s distinguished service over the last two and a half years. Under Paul’s leadership, we’ve made it easier for Marylanders to get from where they live to where opportunity lies — and laid the foundation for a more competitive, affordable state for all,” Moore said in a statement.
“Secretary Weidefeld brought decades of expertise to our team, and he used that wisdom to cultivate a new generation of talent,” Moore said. “Samantha Biddle has the experience, instincts, and knowledge to carry forward the baton of service at the Maryland Department of Transportation. I look forward to continuing our work together as she takes on this new acting role.”
Wiedefeld is the latest secretary to leave the Moore administration as it clears the midpoint of its first term and rounds the corner to re-election mode. In January, Moore announced Kevin Anderson would leave his role as commerce secretary and become an economic development adviser to the governor.
Two weeks later, state Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott announced she would step down amid a budget storm that included a proposed $200 million cut in funding to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
A month ago, embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi left the Moore administration. Schiraldi, a lightning rod for criticism, especially from Republicans, said he left of his own accord. Moore said he asked the secretary to resign.
Word of Wiedefeld’s departure also comes the same week that two other senior aides to Moore are set to move to new roles off the second floor.

Luedtke joins the Department of Natural Resources to oversee capital projects. The move, which was official on June 25, had not been previously announced and was made public in an email Wednesday. Prior to joining he department, Luedtke served as an  adviser to Moore on budget and tax issues.
In a phone interview prior to the release of the email to DNR employees, Luedtke expressed excitement about the new role.
“Secretary Josh Kurtz and the whole crew at DNR are really awesome to work with,” said Luedtke. “The work they do is a real passion project.”
It’s a passion project of Luedtke’s, too.
Prior to joining the Moore administration, was a delegate. One of his last legislative initiatives was passage of the Great Maryland Outdoors Act, which funneled more money into improving facilities at state parks around Maryland.
Luedtke, a former Montgomery County lawmaker, who just returned from a week-long scouting trip spent on a boat in Florida, is an avid hiker who frequently posts on social media about visits to state parks.
This is the second job change for Luedtke in a year.
Luedtke joined the administration early, tapped by Moore in the days after the 2022 election. Moore plucked Luedtke from his role as House Majority leader to become his chief legislative officer.
Last December, Luedtke slid over into his budget and tax role, making way for Jeremy Baker, then chief of staff to House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), to assume the job of Moore’s chief lobbyist.
Also leaving is Fallon, a deputy legislative officer who joined Moore’s team days before the 2023 inauguration, will also leave the second floor next week, according to an email obtained by Maryland Matters.

Fallon leaves the second floor to become the assistant secretary to the new Division of Business Development at the Department of House and Community Development under Secretary Jake Day.
“I’m so excited to hit the ground running and continue advancing Governor Moore and Secretary Day’s goals of a thriving business community and vibrant communities across the state,” Fallon wrote in the email in which he announced his departure.
Fallon served as Luedtke’s chief of staff while in the House. He also co-taught a government class with former Howard County Executive Ken Ulman (D), who co-chaired Moore’s transition team and was later the governor’s pick to lead the Maryland Democratic Party.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0574-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 15:13:26.426308

The online news conference, hosted by the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center on Wednesday, featured national policy experts and members of the group Patriotic Millionaires. They outlined the potential fallout from the recently passed federal budget reconciliation legislation known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” and proposed solutions to soften its impact.

“For too long, North Carolina budget writers have treated tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations as the default, squeezing public services and shifting costs onto families and communities,” said Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center. “North Carolinians reject that approach. They want a budget that puts people first.”
Sirota described the state as being in a “funding crisis” that demands immediate legislative attention, noting that lawmakers adjourned without passing a budget despite growing needs.
Speakers warned that the new federal budget bill could trigger deep cuts to Medicaid, stripping health coverage from more than 600,000 North Carolinians, and saddle the state with up to $438 million a year in food assistance costs.
  Meg Wiehe (Photo: cbpp.org)
Meg Wiehe, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said federal budget changes could force “difficult trade-offs,” potentially slashing funding for education, infrastructure and other services. 
“The Republican budget reconciliation bill will raise costs on North Carolina families and take health coverage, food assistance and other essentials away from North Carolinians who are already struggling to make ends meet,” Wiehe said. 
The speakers called for a number of state-level policy changes to help fill the gap: halting scheduled cuts to corporate and personal income taxes, implementing a millionaire surtax, and drafting a long-term plan to mitigate the impact of reduced federal funding. 
  Miles Trinidad (Photo: itep.org)
Miles Trinidad, a state policy analyst for the Institute on Taxation and Economy Policy, said the state’s tax structure disproportionately burdens lower income residents. “The wealthiest North Carolinians are paying a lower share of their income towards taxes than teachers, firefighters, public safety officers and factory and farm workers,” he said. 
According to analysis by ITEP, Trinidad noted, the lowest 20% of earners pay roughly 10.5% of their income in taxes, compared to just 6% for the top 1%. 
Members of Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high-income earners who advocate for a more equitable tax system, echoed those concerns and called for lawmakers to raise taxes on the wealthy to ensure investments in critical services.”

“Taxing rich folks like me is a commonsense solution, and we cannot continue to create carve outs for those who make the most at the expense of those who make the least,” said Morris Pearl, chair of the group’s board. “Gross inequality is bad for rich people like me too.” 
Monica Lavery, a retired clinical social worker and member of the group, said her family has benefitted from low taxes on investment income and generous pensions, even as public services have eroded.
“For years, my husband and I have watched our wealth accumulate via investment income and generous pensions, while our taxes remained minuscule,” Lavery said. “We want revenue to provide infrastructure for health care, child care, education and housing. As patriotic millionaires and proud North Carolinians, we want to pay our fair share.”
Lavery added that her daughter, a teacher, was forced to leave the state due to low pay and poor working conditions. “We would gladly pay a higher tax rate so our children and their Gen Z peers can afford to stay here and have hopes of someday being able to purchase a home and raise a family,” she said. 
A poll conducted by the North Carolina Budget & Tax Center found broad support for the coalition’s proposals, with 77% of North Carolinians opposing the elimination of corporate income taxes and 70% supporting increased taxes on wealthy corporations to fund education, health care and infrastructure.
“We are concerned the gap between the rich and the poor has grown so large it has created a degree of political unrest that threatens the existence of our democracy,” Pearl said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 15:13:26.426308

(File/Sviatlana Lazarenka/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina hospitals are set to take a multimillion-dollar annual cut when treating Medicaid patients as the new law pushed through Congress phases out a complicated program that boosted the government’s payments for medical care.
In 2028, South Carolina will start losing its ability to pay hospitals for treating Medicaid patients at similar rates as private insurance through what’s known as the state directed payment program.
For the 60 general care hospitals in the Palmetto State, that collectively means a looming loss of roughly $150 million annually over 15 years, according to the state’s hospital industry group.
Instead of hospitals getting reimbursed with rates that align with private insurance — as they have for the last two years — payments would plummet back to Medicare levels. The difference would mean an estimated $2.4 billion loss, according to the advocacy group.
Without action by the state Legislature, this will lead to higher all-around costs for health care and insurance for all South Carolinians, according to hospital advocates and researchers. To deal with the change in finances, hospitals may shift costs to other patients, they said.
In the worst-case scenario, small, cash-strapped hospitals — often located in rural areas — may cut back on the services they offer or close altogether, forcing South Carolinians to travel farther from home for emergency health care.
That would add to the six rural hospitals that have closed since 2010, according to a 2023 legislative study.
The taxing changes are part of the law titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that President Donald Trump signed Friday, which marked some of the biggest reductions in health care spending in U.S. history — estimated at $1 trillion over 10 years nationwide, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.
How increased taxes benefited hospitals
The law phases out the so-called state directed payment program authorized by federal regulators in the final months of the Obama administration in 2016.
It allowed states to use money collected by taxing hospitals to ultimately give back to them — and then some — through increased rates for treating Medicaid patients. The goal was to improve access to non-emergency health care.
Since 2023, South Carolina has used the program to hike Medicaid payments to hospitals by a whopping 70% on average. That’s how much it took to bring payments in line with treating a privately insured patient.
The Palmetto State is among 36 states using the program to boost Medicaid rates. Eleven of those, including South Carolina, use it to take rates fully to the private market rate. (The others are Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, and New Mexico.)
Hospital taxes are nothing new.
South Carolina has taxed hospitals to help pay its share of the state-federal insurance program since 1989. But it wasn’t until two years ago that the Legislature gave the state’s Medicaid agency permission to hike those taxes to increase reimbursement rates.
Those state taxes will likely be readjusted with the federal law’s phase-in, though it’s unclear how much that could help.
According to the state Department of Revenue, the state collected about $270 million annually from hospital taxes until 2023. That jumped to $918 million for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2023, after legislators inserted the authorization in the state budget.
Those taxes are used to draw down more money from the federal government, thereby increasing rates.
For the fiscal year that just ended June 30, South Carolina’s participation in the program provided hospitals an additional $2.5 billion: $1.75 billion from the federal government and $761 million from higher state taxes funneled back to them, according to documents filed by the state Department of Health and Human Services.
The resulting higher reimbursement rates make treating the 1.3 million South Carolina children and adults covered by Medicaid more financially attractive.
They’ve been a boon for health care providers, with Wall Street ratings agencies boosting their credit ratings in response.
Federal law requires hospitals to treat all patients in emergency situations regardless of their ability to pay. But doctors can turn away Medicaid patients seeking non-emergency care.
Nonprofit hospitals are less likely to refuse treatment as this care is often a condition of their tax-exempt status, according to the American Hospital Association. The higher rates increased access to private, for-profit hospitals and doctors less inclined to take patients paying through Medicaid.
The new law undoes nearly all of that. It gradually reduces states’ ability to use federal taxes to boost reimbursement rates, starting in 2028 — the final year of the Trump administration. The 10% annual reduction to the program would continue until 2043.
“Once fully phased in, the rate will be capped in a way that effectively ends the value of the program,” said Kyle Thompson, a spokesman for the South Carolina Hospital Association.
The difference between what Medicaid pays and what the service actually costs will fall on hospitals’ balance sheets to be made up in other ways.
South Carolina hospitals already had $3.2 billion worth of uncompensated care on their books last year, according to the state Hospital Association, a number expected to grow.
Under prior federal law, hospitals that treat an outsized number of Medicaid and uninsured patients receive additional payments to partially offset those costs.
To help rural hospitals most heavily impacted by the new law, Congress set aside a $50 billion pot of money to be distributed nationwide over five years. How much of that will go to South Carolina’s hospitals is not yet known.
‘Survival mode’
As Republicans in Congress debated how to slash spending, state Hospital Association President Thornton Kirby told the SC Daily Gazette he feared a return to the financial instability amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since weathering those struggles, hospitals have been holding ribbon cuttings on new facilities and announcing plans for future building projects.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

And the state has made gains in addressing issues such as mental health and infant and maternal mortality, Kirby said.
In 2022, that included extending Medicaid coverage for new moms from 60 days to a full year after having a baby.
Those gains are in question, Kirby said in April.
“As soon as you threaten (hospitals’) funding model, all of a sudden now they are in survival mode, and they don’t spend as much energy trying to improve community health, because they’re trying to just avoid layoffs and shutting down service lines,” he said months ahead of the constantly changing bill being finalized.
As passed, other parts of the law don’t impact South Carolina as much as other states.
That’s because the biggest cost-cutting measures apply to states that expanded Medicaid coverage to all adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare. South Carolina is among the 10 states that never did.
In the expansion states, the law requires Medicaid enrollees to file paperwork every six months to prove their incomes meet eligibility rules. People applying or renewing coverage will also have to verify they’re working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child.
That’s expected to result in people losing their Medicaid coverage, at least partly due to bureaucracy and confusion.
While those rules don’t apply to South Carolina, the state has a higher percentage of uninsured residents, giving hospitals much less wiggle room to absorb the impact of payment reductions, said Kevin Bennett, director of the Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine.
Thin margins
South Carolina’s hospitals generally operate on margins between 0% and 4%, according to the state Hospital Association.
The margins for rural hospitals are the thinnest as they have a smaller population base to spread costs over. They also tend to have a greater percentage of patients on Medicare and Medicaid.
“From what we’ve heard from those hospitals we work with, any substantial change is going to challenge their viability,” said Graham Adams, head of the state Office of Rural Health. “It’s going to be very hard for them to get by.”
While hospitals are concentrated in South Carolina’s three major metro areas, all but five of South Carolina’s 46 counties have at least one hospital or emergency center.
Five hospitals have reported negative margins for three consecutive years, putting them most at risk, according to a study provided to Congress by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:

Prisma Health’s Oconee Memorial Hospital in Seneca
MUSC Health Chester Medical Center, purchased by MUSC in 2019
MUSC Health Marion Medical Center in Mullins, purchased by MUSC in 2019
MUSC Health Orangeburg, operations taken over by MUSC in 2023
Abbeville Area Medical Center

“If a hospital closed in Columbia, people might not notice,” Bennett said. “But if Abbeville’s hospital closed, it would be a tragedy.”
If the financial losses become too much, Bennett said, rural hospitals might seek designations as “rural emergency hospitals” as a way to keep going. These hospitals tend to receive a higher payment rate from Medicare. They also pare down their operations to emergency care and some outpatient services, only treating patients who stay for no more than 24 hours.
No hospital in South Carolina has sought that designation yet.
Among the five hospitals deemed most at risk, those in Chester, Marion and Orangeburg have the backing of the state-owned hospital system. Oconee and Abbeville do not.
State legislators whose district includes Abbeville did not respond to calls from the SC Daily Gazette. Senate President Thomas Alexander of Walhalla, who represents all of Oconee County, declined to comment at this time. A spokeswoman for the Medical University of South Carolina also did not respond to messages.
Hospital leaders in the state plan to meet with the governor, legislative leaders, and officials with the state’s Medicaid agency in the coming months. The hospital association could also seek to revive discussions around Medicaid expansion, after Gov. Henry McMaster vetoed a study of the matter last year.
“Reductions on this scale create serious problems, and South Carolina hospitals will need serious solutions from our elected leaders to prevent widespread reductions in services, staffing layoffs, and facility closures,” Thompson, the association’s spokesman, said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/nurse-in-hospital.jpg,,,2025-07-09 15:13:26.426308

In their complaint, the Home Builders Association of Michigan and the Michigan Manufactured Homes Association argued the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs failed to meet cost-effectiveness requirements. 
In order for construction codes to be considered cost effective, the costs of an improvement must be recovered by the benefits they would bring within seven years. The department must also ensure that qualified buyers are not priced out by the new standards and that the costs of principal, interest, taxes, insurance and utilities will not be greater than they were under the previous energy efficiency rules.

While the new rules, set to take effect on Aug. 29, 2025, would update Michigan’s residential construction code and its uniform energy code using the 2021 edition of the International Residential Code, in a Monday order signed by Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford, the department agreed with the builders associations to hold off on implementing the codes until this case has been resolved. 
The department will also remove links to access the 2021 Michigan Residential Code Book – which includes the changes at question – from its website. Through the duration of the case, the 2015 version of the International Residential Code and the residential provisions of the 2015 International Energy Code, will continue to dictate energy efficiency requirements for Michigan builders.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new-home-construction-1-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 15:13:26.426308

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)A new law that requires Minnesota jails to give people access to their previously prescribed medications has been temporarily suspended in response to a lawsuit from the Minnesota Sheriffs Association.
Advocates for the mentally ill and incarcerated people are now fighting back. 
The lawsuit seeks an injunction, arguing that the Larry R. Hill Reform Act would require medical professionals to use medication that “could be harmful or fatal to inmates.” Sheriffs, counties, companies that provide health care in jails and doctors they employ also signed onto the suit. 
Advocacy organizations say the alternative is dangerous. 
“Too often, individuals with mental illnesses are denied the medications they need, and then the sheriffs wonder why they decompensate — or even die,” said Sue Abderholden, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Minnesota, in a press release. “For example, jail is hardly the place to make changes to antipsychotic treatment.”
Jails and prisons are among the nation’s biggest facilities housing the mentally ill, who often receive care from private, for-profit companies that are eager to cut costs. MEnD Correctional Care, once the largest provider of health care in Minnesota jails, went bankrupt in 2022 after several lawsuits alleged that its services led to preventable deaths. 
The new act was named after Larry R. Hill, who died in Hennepin County Jail after not receiving medication. 
The bill was passed after efforts from Minnesota groups seeking to improve health care access in jails. It was included in a public safety bill signed by Gov. Tim Walz in May. The legislation includes exceptions if an incarcerated person states in writing that they don’t want to take the prescribed medication, or a health care professional consults with the doctor who prescribed it and they determine it’s no longer needed. 
The suit argues that these exceptions require getting in contact with outside health care providers, who may be difficult to reach and are unaware of the current condition of the patient.
“The provisions of the new amendment do not allow medical providers caring for inmates to exercise their professional judgment regarding the appropriate medication for that patient at the time of incarceration, even when all evidence establishes a different course of treatment is medically necessary,” the complaint reads. 
Rep. Kelly Moller, the Democratic co-chair of the Public Safety Committee, and bill author Rep. Jess Hanson released a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying the bill received bipartisan support and there was no testimony opposing it in committee. 
“No one who goes to jail should have to worry if they are going to become permanently disabled or die without access to the medication their doctor prescribed them,” the statement said. “The opponents of this legislation are being led by an out-of-state, for-profit industry that contracts with jails to earn a profit off the backs of incarcerated people who need medical care.”
The temporary restraining order will be in effect until August 1. A hearing on the case is set to take place on July 25.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-sb10062143p-001-1024x769-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 14:20:35.086195

Thirty-four cities and counties, including Allegheny County, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda.
The expansion of the case could be a sign that more cities are seeing the benefit of suing to protect their rights in court from a Trump administration that is often acting without regard for legal precedent. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits nationwide injunctions means that cities and states must be part of a lawsuit to get the benefits of any injunction that would stop such policies while the legal merits are debated in court.
The federal judge in the case, William Orrick of the U.S. District Court of Northern California, did issue an injunction April 24, telling Trump administration it couldn’t use executive orders to withhold federal funding from the original 15 cities and counties in the lawsuit. Orrick updated the injunction June 23 to include later policy memos tying “all new federal awards” to immigration compliance. The Trump administration said it would appeal the injunction.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It appears that the defendants continue to seek an end run around the preliminary injunction,” Orrick wrote in June. Orrick left the door open for the administration to withhold funds directly tied to illegal immigration, but he said the administration still must make a case that there’s a real connection between immigration and other issues — especially with seemingly unrelated programs like highway and housing funds.
If the new cities and counties are accepted into the lawsuit, there would be a total of 50 localities in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

The Supreme Court decision in Trump v. CASA, limiting nationwide injunctions, now “creates more impetus in this litigation and in others for more parties to seek relief to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
Generally, the local sanctuary policies at stake are those that limit cooperation with “detainers” asking local law enforcement authorities to hold arrested people in jail up to two days after they would otherwise go free, on behalf of federal immigration investigations. Some states and localities limit cooperation with the detainers, and some require cooperation.










Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.


– Jonathan Miller, attorney for counties and cities suing over funding threats


“[Trump officials] are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting local governments to do their bidding and this case is pushback against that,” Miller said. “Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.”
In a March filing, attorneys for the Trump administration defended the planned funding cutoffs as part of the president’s Jan. 20 executive order to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’ which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.”
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, in a response to a reporter’s question that was posted July 8 by the White House, said the administration is determined than ever to go after cities that don’t fully cooperate.
“We’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because they’re a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is,” Homan said. “We know they’re releasing public safety threats.”
According to June numbers obtained by the TRAC data clearinghouse at the University of Syracuse, nearly 44% of people held in immigration detention have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses such as traffic violations. The rest were detained based on pending charges or purely immigration-related offenses such as crossing the border in secret.

(Getty Images)Eight Indiana organizations have nabbed a collective $12.9 million in grants to develop a statewide on-the-job training initiative, courtesy of the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation.
The first cohort of high school students will begin apprenticeship programs in the new Indiana Career Apprenticeship Pathway in the fall of 2026, according to a Wednesday news release.
Participants will do at least half their training in the workplace and the rest in the classroom. They’ll be paid by their employers and work year-round.
Programs for adults will be available “in later years,” the announcement continued.
The initiative will be “a vehicle for employers and educators to collaborate in a process that serves both students and industry,” said foundation President and CEO Claire Fiddian-Green.
Indiana secures $6.25 million to advance apprenticeships

“It promises to revolutionize the way Indiana equips people for careers and, as a result, prepare Indiana for long-term economic growth,” she added.
Fiddian-Green is also co-chair of CEMETS iLab Indiana — the coalition of more than 300 Hoosier leaders from an array of industries, schools, nonprofits, philanthropies and governments that will lead the foundation-funded effort.
CEMETS iLab Indiana leaders want the Indiana Career Apprenticeship Pathway to provide education and training to 50,000 Hoosier students by 2034, per the release.
The initiative was modeled after a Swiss program in operation since the 1970s.
The dollars
Ascend Indiana, of the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership, will use a five-year, $9.6 million grant to keep managing CEMETS iLab Indiana operations and support statewide employer bodies dubbed industry talent associations.
It will also regrant $1.2 million to regional “intermediaries” that will “serve as bridges” between the industry talent associations, schools and students. And it’ll do marketing for the initiative.
The foundation also made two grants to launch a pair of new employer groups:

The Indiana Construction Roundtable Foundation received a two-year, $380,000 grant to launch the Construction Industry Talent Association.
The Indiana Chamber Foundation received a one-year, $160,000 grant to serve as an incubator for an Information Technology Industry Talent Association and prepare it to operate as a separate entity by 2026.

Other grants will go to the organizations supporting four existing industry talent associations. Those were launched last year with Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation help:

$180,000 to BioCrossroads, via the CICP, for the Healthcare Industry Talent Association and the Life Sciences Industry Talent Association
$130,000 to Conexus Indiana, via the CICP, for the Advanced Manufacturing and Logistics Industry Talent Association
$130,000 to the Indiana Bankers Association for the Banking Industry Talent Association

The foundation additionally granted $1.7 million over three years for the Indy Chamber to promote the initiative and generally “boost awareness of career opportunities” — and make a playbook for other Indiana regions to do the same.
EmployIndy also will receive a one-year, $430,000 grant to fund the three cohorts operating under the current Modern Apprenticeship Program and help facilitate the transition to the new initiative.
“Developing a new model for Hoosier students and a stronger talent pipeline for Indiana employers is a huge undertaking; that is why we’re bringing in more organizations with specific expertise and built-in stakeholders to make it work,” said David Becker, CEMETS iLab Indiana co-chair and chairman. He is CEO of First Internet Bank.
The foundation has, since 2016, awarded nearly $25 million in grants for youth apprenticeship pilot programs and the education and training pathway “now known as” the Indiana Career Apprenticeship Pathway, the news release said.
Richard M. Fairbanks, the late founder and owner of Fairbanks Communications, established it in 1986 to “strengthen the city of Indianapolis and perpetuate the Fairbanks legacy in the city where the family prospered for over a century,” according to the website.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)A federal judge late Tuesday night blocked parts of Florida’s sweeping new crackdown on ballot initiatives but refused to stop provisions that could hamstring efforts to ask voters next year to expand Medicaid.
This marks the second time that U.S. District Judge Mark Walker has been asked to put on hold the contentious new law that Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican legislators pushed through after two measures dealing with abortion access and recreational marijuana nearly passed last November.
Federal judge refuses to temporarily halt most of the new ballot initiative restrictions

In his latest ruling, Walker stopped the state from enforcing HB 1205’s ban against non-Florida residents and non-U.S. citizens collecting petitions. This was one of the key requests from groups behind the lawsuit, including Florida Decides Healthcare, the group behind the Medicaid expansion initiative. Also involved are Smart & Safe Florida, pushing a new recreational marijuana  amendment, and Florida Right to Clean Water. 
But Walker did not go along with a request to block a 90-day moratorium on verification of signatures which only was being challenged by FDH. Walker said the organization lacked standing and didn’t prove a substantial likelihood that it would succeed on the merits, among the legal triggers plaintiffs must prove to obtain an injunction.
“According to FDH, this delay in updated verified petition counts, in turn, will hamstring FDH’s ability to generate enthusiasm and support, persuade donors to commit funds to FDH’s cause, and ultimately,  succeed in placing its initiative on the ballot next year due to the anticipated impact that this delay will have on the expectations and reactions of third parties not before this court,” Walker wrote. “But this asserted injury is largely conjectural and flows not directly from the moratorium itself, but from its anticipated downstream effects … .”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Walker also refused to block the requirement that those gathering petitions complete and sign in a voter’s presence an affidavit that includes their names, permanent addresses and that they were not paid on a per-signature basis. Those provisions were challenged by the Florida League of Women Voters and Florida Right to Clean Water, which asserted a chilling effect because of fear of harassment.
“For this chill to amount to a cognizable injury in fact, the fear of harassment  must be an objectively reasonable one,” he wrote. 
“But here, to support their contention that the asserted subjective fears of harassment constitute an injury for  standing purposes, Plaintiffs only point to either generalized fears of potential harassment from unidentified members of the public or instances of harassment and political violence that are wholly disconnected from their connection to the protected expression at issue in this case.”
Walker did agree to block a provision in the law that requires all petition circulators — paid and unpaid — to be state residents and U.S. citizens. The law allows the state to impose a $50,000 fine per non-resident circulator. 
Smart & Safe, the sponsor of a recreational marijuana ballot, testified in court last month that it is collecting about a one-third of the 78,000 petition signatures per week that it collected before the enactment of the challenged provisions.
‘Dramatic mismatch’
The state argued that the residency and citizenship requirements are necessary to combat fraud, but Walker said they went too far.
“To be sure, investigating and combating fraud in the initiative process is  certainly a compelling interest — the question is whether a complete ban on non residents and non-citizens, even lawful permanent residents, from engaging in petition circulation is narrowly tailored to furthering this interest,” Walker  wrote. 
“Here, the record demonstrates a dramatic mismatch between the State’s  interest in combating fraud in the initiative process and limiting the pool of potential petition circulators to U.S. citizens who are Florida residents.”
Voters in Florida over the last two decades have passed a number of initiatives opposed by GOP legislators, including measures that raised the state’s minimum wage and allowed for the use of medical marijuana. Last November, the recreational marijuana and abortion initiatives fell just below the 60% margin needed to win.
Lawmakers responded with HB 1205, which  completely overhauls the process used to collect signatures.
The group that first launched the lawsuit lauded Walker’s ruling.
“Within two months of this law passing, a federal judge has now ruled twice that different parts of it are unconstitutional and violate the constitutional  rights of Floridians to participate and have a say in their state’s democracy. These rulings tell you everything you need to know about how extreme this law is,”  Mitch Emerson, executive eirector of Florida Decides Healthcare, said in a prepared statement. 
“While we don’t agree with every part of the ruling, today was a great day for our campaign and for Florida voters. We now have a clear and achievable path to get on the ballot.”
Groups must gather nearly 881,000 signatures from across the state by next February to make the 2026 ballot. So far, Smart & Safe Florida has gotten more than 613,000 signatures verified while Florida Decides Healthcare has gotten nearly 63,000 signatures verified.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As the 2026 gubernatorial race inches closer, Gov. Dan McKee’s favorability among voters continues to nosedive, with a 25% approval rating among voters surveyed by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University — 11 percentage points less than a year ago.
Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of those surveyed disapproved of McKee’s job performance, according to the poll published Wednesday. The poll was conducted by Embold Research, which surveyed 804 voters who participated in the 2024 presidential election. The margin of error is 3.6%.
Self-identified Democrats were less harsh on McKee, with 43% indicating they approved of his job performance. Just 5% of identified Republicans agreed, and 19% of independent voters, according to the survey. 
McKee is the only declared candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial race, though his 2022 primary rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, is widely expected to mount a comeback challenge next year. Other names floated, but unconfirmed, for the race include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 2022 Republican candidate Ashley Kalus.
The Pell Center did not ask voters why they disapproved of McKee’s job performance. However, a separate survey question gauging voters’ confidence that the Washington Bridge rebuild will be completed on time, and on budget, offers at least one reason, said Katie Sonder, the Pell Center’s associate director.
More than eight in 10 survey respondents believed it was unlikely the reconstruction of the westbound highway would be finished by the November 2028 deadline, and for the $427 million price that state officials indicated in June. Republican voters were the most skeptical — 94% doubted the completion date and cost — but even 79% of Democrats did not trust the stated timeline and cost, according to the survey.
“That certainly doesn’t help the governor,” Sonder said in an interview.
But McKee’s favorability has been dropping even before the latest update extending the timeline and upping the cost for the major bridge rebuild project. A separate, national poll released Monday also put McKee’s approval rating at 25% — the lowest of any New England governor, and 9 percentage points lower than President Donald Trump, according to the Civic Health and Institutions Project’s 50 States Survey.
Rob Silverstein, McKee’s 2026 campaign manager, downplayed the governor’s polling numbers.
“Polls come and go — what matters is the work,” Silverstein said in an email Wednesday. “From breaking ground on new community learning centers across our state, to the opening of Amazon’s new facility, and preparing to complete our new state health lab — Governor McKee is focused on delivering results for Rhode Islanders.”
McKee is not the only state Democrat who has lost favor within their own party. Democrats nationwide are grappling with how to rebound from the results of the 2024 elections, Sonder said.

Boost for Amo, Reed still leads
Indeed, three of Rhode Island’s four-member Democratic congressional delegation also saw lower approval ratings in the July 9 Pell Center poll compared with a year ago. Only U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo, who represents the 1st Congressional District, got a boost in ratings, up 2 percentage points year-over-year. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed still maintains the highest approval rating, backed by 50% of survey respondents. 
“Democrats in general are more negative right now,” Sonder said. “A lot of representatives have lost ground in the Democratic party.”










Polls come and go — what matters is the work.

Democratic state officeholders also did not have a strong showing: Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ approval rating was even lower than McKee’s, at 22%, while General Treasurer James Diossa and Secretary of State Gregg Amore each received a 29% approval rating, according to the survey.

But even more voters surveyed indicated they were unsure, suggesting the lesser-known state officeholders’ favorability has more to do with lack of name recognition than a true assessment of their job performance in office, Sonder said. More than four in 10 voters were not sure how to answer when asked about Amore and Diossa’s job performance, while three in 10 felt the same about Matos.
One exception: Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose 38% approval rating, with 25% unsure, proved the strongest among state general officers. Not a surprise to Sonder, given Neronha’s vocal stances and heavy involvement in the avalanche of state-led lawsuits against the Trump administration since January. 
Political party held little sway over voters’ expectations around the Washington Bridge. But it dictated the breakdown in perceptions on a host of other national and state issues, including the high-profile assault weapons ban that dominated Rhode Island’s 2025 session.

Hot button issues
The question posed to voters gauged support for a statewide ban on assault weapons, including purchase, sale and possession — reflecting the original legislation introduced on Smith Hill this year, but not the final version, which only addresses sale and purchase, not possession. More than five in 10 respondents indicated support, compared with 44% opposed. However, the splits were more pronounced along party lines, with 85% of Democrats supporting a ban, while 81% of Republicans opposed it. 
“That reflects what we see at the national level,” Sonder said. “Guns are a partisan issue.”
Most interesting to Sonder was the stance among unaffiliated voters, who leaned conservative on gun restrictions, with 55% opposing a state assault-style weapons ban, compared with 43% who supported it.
However, the state’s independent block leaned to the left on other prospective policies, like a millionaire’s tax: supported by 91% of Democrats, and 64% of independents. Legislation introduced this year to impose an extra 3% tax in the top 1% of state earners failed to advance in both chambers, though Shekarchi indicated that lawmakers might reconsider the extra tax if they return for a special, fall session to deal with federal funding cuts.










Democrats in general are more negative right now. A lot of representatives have lost ground in the Democratic party.

Also left on the State House cutting-room floor this year were various proposals to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers, either through a one-time increase or an incremental set of raises. Though the bills failed to advance, voters of all parties overwhelmingly supported the policy, according to the Pell Center survey.
Less popular was the prospect of a state bottle refund program, a perennial legislative hot potato which was punted to a state-commissioned study at the end of the 2025 session. Nearly six in 10 voters supported the prospect of a 10-cent, refundable deposit on recyclable beverage containers, compared with one-third who opposed it, according to the survey. The breakdown is similar to the results of a separate, March survey commissioned by Save the Bay, a vocal advocate for the policy idea. However, a competing April survey by beverage manufacturers and retailers revealed an opposite split — 34% support and 60% opposition — after voters heard messages from supporters and opponents. 
Much of the bottle bill dispute on Smith Hill centered on word choice and phrasing: manufacturers and retailers labeled the deposit as a “tax” that would hurt working families, while environmental advocates insisted the program was a proven way to reduce littering and incentivize recycling, at no additional cost to the state or consumers. 
Sonder said the Pell Center tried to choose the most neutral language in wording its question about the bottle bill to survey takers. 
On the national level, the survey also took respondents’ temperatures on the economy, immigration, the state of democracy, and federal funding for key programs like Medicare and Social Security. Responses were divided along party lines, with Republicans expressing positive views on the economy and the health of the country’s democracy, while Democrats soured on both. Across the aisle, however, those surveyed generally expressed support for more federal spending on Medicare, Social Security, and education.
Nearly half of the 804 survey respondents are unaffiliated voters, with 36% registered Democrats and 15% Republicans. More than eight in 10 identified as white, compared with 7% Hispanic and 4% Black. The survey also reflected a range of ages and educational status.

(Paul Hammel for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office is getting another chance to resurrect its felony prosecution of a former state agency head for misuse of funds.
The Nebraska Supreme Court granted the AG’s request for further review of an appeals court’s dismissal of the case against Trevor Jones, the former director of the state historical society. The court gave Jones’ attorneys and the AG’s Office until Sept. 2 to submit arguments about the discharge of the case by the Nebraska Court of Appeals.

The prosecution of Jones for alleged felony theft by deception has seen several ups and downs since a state audit in 2022 raised questions about his redirection of $270,000 in donated funds provided by a private foundation to one he preferred.
The AG’s Office filed the criminal charge after the Lancaster County Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. The case progressed from county court to Lancaster County District Court. But in January, Judge Susan Strong dismissed the case, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to bring Jones to trial soon enough, violating his right to a “speedy trial.”
That led to an appeal to the Nebraska Court of Appeals, where, in March, Judge Frankie Moore discharged the case, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to follow proper procedure in appealing the lower court’s dismissal.
The Supreme Court’s one-paragraph response, issued July 3, asks for briefs narrowed to two specific legal issues: whether so-called “special proceedings” are civil in nature and whether the state has the right to appeal an adverse ruling in a special proceeding criminal case.
The Attorney General’s Office declined to comment this week. But in prior court briefs, it had asked for the Supreme Court review, arguing that the Appeals Court erred in dismissing the case prior to a deadline. Its attorneys argued that “greater clarity” was needed about the proper procedure to appeal the discharging of a prosecution.

They added that the high profile nature of the case required such a review.
One of Jones’ defense attorneys, Mallory Hughes, said by email that they continue to maintain that the AG’s Office “failed to comply with technical appellate procedural rules in multiple phases of this case,” and thus their appeal should be denied.
Jones had served six years as the $164,800-a-year director of the state historical agency, then called “History Nebraska.” He resigned suddenly in 2022 — telling co-workers he wanted to travel in France — prior to the release of a state audit that raised concerns about his handling of $270,000 in donations.
The donations, from the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation, were intended to help cover financial losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. But Jones, who had been spatting with the foundation’s leaders, instead deposited the $270,000 with a rival foundation that he’d set up. Such donations, prosecutors have argued, should be deposited with the state treasury.
Jones, who has maintained that he is not guilty, could face a possible penalty of up to 20 years in prison if the case against him is revived.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – State and local officials are preparing for possible changes to federal disaster relief following President Donald Trump’s announcement last month that he wants to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would leave states without a significant source of support when managing disaster preparedness and response.
The Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June to November, is often a dangerous time for states along the Gulf Coast. Louisiana has experienced six hurricanes of category three or higher since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Between 2015-24, Louisiana residents received the most FEMA direct assistance of all states, at $53 million through the Individuals and Households Program.
New Orleans has “highly” relied on federal funding to rebuild after devastating natural disasters in the past, said a spokesperson for New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell in response to a question from Verite News about the potential impact of eliminating FEMA.
“If FEMA no longer exists, the City hopes that there is a clear, strategic plan to provide funding to impacted cities, parishes, and counties because local government is small and depends heavily on various assistance elements,” Cantrell spokesperson Leatrice Dupré said in a statement.
One FEMA-funded resilience project in the city has already lost $1.2 million in funding after the agency ended its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program in April.
The Resilient Algiers Project aimed to repurpose vacant lots in Algiers into an urban farm and green space designed to manage stormwater and prevent flooding, said Austin Feldbaum, director of the city of New Orleans’ Hazard Mitigation Office, at a recent community meeting held at Rosa F. Keller Library.
“We are not sure if we’re actually going to be able to get that money,” he said. “But we’re going to go ahead and negotiate everything with the engineer  and figure out if we can afford to risk the funds not getting paid back to us.”
Feldbaum added that he and his colleagues are worried about all of the office’s projects going forward.
“Not so much for existing projects, but for anything moving forward, yes I think [there is concern],” he said.

At a press conference on June 3, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he does not believe significant funding cuts will take place during this year’s hurricane season, which ends in November.
“What we have seen from the time of Katrina through now is that the bureaucracy inside the federal government has a tendency to tangle things up,” he said. “I think that all the president is trying to do is to make sure that … the state has the ability of actual mission control and the authority to be able to act quickly.”
He added that the state remains ready for the upcoming hurricane season and urged Louisianians to do their part in preparing for natural disasters.
“Make sure that you have an evacuation plan, make sure that you secure important documents and make sure that you check vital supply kits,” he said.
Samantha Montano, an associate professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said while it is valid to criticize FEMA, significant funding cuts would leave states unsupported.
“What the Trump administration is proposing feels to me like the opposite of the solution here,” she said. “There are other ways of streamlining FEMA programs.”
Montano said that if the priority is efficiency, offering initiatives such as a universal aid application and improved fraud protection measures would be a better solution than cutting funding entirely.
“Before FEMA existed, it was even more inefficient, because you had all these different federal agencies involved in emergency management,” she said. “That’s not to say we can’t make it more efficient or whatnot, but the agency itself serves that purpose.”
At the June 3 press conference, Brigadier General Jason Mahfouz, director of the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the state had been in touch with FEMA ahead of hurricane season.
“The logistics apparatus that kicks in from FEMA normally when state resources are overwhelmed has been validated and pledged to us,” he said. “The plans have been rehearsed and are in place.”
Mahfouz asked that Louisianians use the website getagameplan.org for tips and checklists to prepare for a natural disaster.
But even if plans for this hurricane season are in place, how much federal help Louisiana will get with emergency management and disaster recovery in the future is unclear. Montano noted that the proposed FEMA cuts have not been well received by the people most affected by natural disasters.
“That’s antithetical to what communities are asking for post-disaster,” she said. “What we’re hearing from the public is that they want more support from FEMA, not less.”

,WyoFile,2025-07-09 17:56:09+00:00,WyoFile,Is Wyoming’s ‘prison gerrymandering’ overrepresenting some districts while depriving prisoners of political representation?,Andrew Graham,,,,,https://wyofile.com/is-wyomings-prison-gerrymandering-overrepresenting-some-districts-while-depriving-prisoners-of-political-representation/,"

Incarcerated people can’t vote, but are counted as residents of the legislative district where they're incarcerated, not where they actually call home, a new report finds.
The post Is Wyoming’s ‘prison gerrymandering’ overrepresenting some districts while depriving prisoners of political representation? appeared first on WyoFile .","As convicted felons, the people incarcerated in Wyoming’s prisons don’t get to vote until they’ve served their time and gone through a state process to restore their rights. 
But even without the right to vote they, too, are constitutionally represented by the senators and representatives who go to Cheyenne each year to craft state laws. 
A report published by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group dedicated to reforming the country’s prison systems, says Wyoming’s inmates aren’t being properly counted when legislative maps are drawn and are instead padding the populations of two statehouse districts in particular. 
It’s called “prison gerrymandering,” Prison Policy Initiative researchers write in the report, published today, and the Wyoming districts are among the worst cases in the nation. 
Wyoming House District 2, which covers parts of Goshen, Niobrara and Weston counties, includes the women’s prison outside Lusk, the medium security men’s prison outside Torrington, and the Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp outside Newcastle, the state’s minimum security prison. Because inmates in those facilities are counted as district denizens, prisoners, who cannot vote, make up nearly 14% of District 2’s residents. 
The report’s authors say including those incarcerated Wyomingites as residents of District 2 robs them of their constitutional right to elected representation, and also contradicts state law around what defines residency. When people in prisons want to bring an issue to the concern of their elected official, they tend to write to the person representing the town or county they call home, not the lawmaker for the district containing their prison, Mike Wessler, communications director for the Prison Policy Initiative, told WyoFile in an interview. 
“Do lawmakers [in the prison-holding districts] consider people who are incarcerated their constituents?” he asked. 
Rep. JD Williams, R-Lusk, who currently represents House District 2, said yes. He acknowledges inmates in his district as his constituents, he said, though many are there only until their sentence is complete. They weren’t the only transient population he represented, Williams said — naming agricultural and construction workers, among others. But the lawmaker, who is in his second term, also said he doesn’t often hear from denizens of the three prison facilities in his district. 
“It is very rare for an inmate to contact me with an issue that can be addressed legislatively,” Williams told WyoFile by email, “but many of my constituents staff the Department of Corrections facilities in and near my district and so I certainly am responsible to them.”
Williams considered it unlikely Wyoming will change course on how it includes incarcerated people in legislative maps going forward, he said, because the federal government still counts them as residents of the place where the prisons are located. 
A map maintained by the Legislative Service Office shows how the border of Rep. JD Williams’ House District 2 jags northeast to capture the Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp, a minimum security prison outside Newcastle.
The Prison Policy Initiative argues it’s incumbent on states to make the change, because the federal census counting method for incarcerated people is misguided. Wyoming stands out, Wessler said, because, unlike other states, including neighboring Montana, it has not moved to link prisoners to the place they came from in their political representation. 
House District 2 is among the 10 worst such gerrymandered districts in the nation, according to the report. If prison gerrymandering leaves incarcerated people poorly represented, it gives residents of towns and counties around the prisons excess voting power, the Prison Policy Initiative argued. In the case of House District 2, 86 residents have “as much political clout” as 100 residents of a Wyoming House district without a prison, the report says. 
Wyoming law governing residency also appears to conflict with how the Legislature has conducted districting around prisons, according to the report. State statute defines a residence as “the place to which, whenever he [or she] is absent, he [or she] has the intention of returning.” It also specifically states a Wyomingite doesn’t lose their official place of residence “merely by reason” of being “kept at a hospital or other institution.” The Prison Policy Initiative contends prisons fit the definition of “other institution.” 
“That is one reason for Wyoming lawmakers to fix this, just to make sure they are in compliance with their own laws about where people call home,” Wessler said.
The Legislature last redrew its political maps, a process called redistricting, in 2022. The debate was contentious and came down to the wire on legislative deadlines. The maps drawn by the Legislature already left some districts underrepresented, according to WyoFile reporting at the time. The concept of prison gerrymandering did not come up during those debates, according to Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee Chairman Cale Case. 
The Lander Republican’s committee did the lion’s share of the redistricting work that year. But both the House and Senate changed the maps once they hit the chamber floors. “There was so much noise and maneuvering going on with redistricting, but the issue of counting inmates did not come up that I remember,” Case told WyoFile. 
Case, who has helmed the Senate committee charged with governing elections since 2007, is familiar with the prison gerrymandering concept, he told WyoFile. “I definitely think there’s some significance,” he said. “Do I feel like the inmates’ rights are compromised by the way they’re counted? I’m not sure.”

Like the authors of the Prison Policy Initiative report, Case recalled a high-profile incident of alleged prison gerrymandering during the 2012 redistricting. That year, then-state Sen. Curt Meier, today the state treasurer, brought an amendment to the redistricting legislation that redrew his Goshen County district to capture a prison and boost its population, according to a report in the Casper Star-Tribune by longtime political journalist Joan Barron.
The resulting district, Barron wrote, “looks like a finger as it hugs the eastern Wyoming border north then twists to the west at the tip.”
The goal of the “truly weird configuration” was to capture the medium security prison in Torrington, she reported, in a redistricting year where the original maps would have left Meier up against a Cheyenne senator in a tough reelection battle. 
These days, Torrington and its prison are squarely within Meier’s old Senate District 3, which today is held by Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, and the heavily gerrymandered line is gone. The northern border of both Senate District 3 and House District 2 does jag up to round in the honor conservation camp, but Wessler said there’s not as much evidence that Wyoming lawmakers gerrymandered prisons deliberately in 2022. It is more, he said, an error of omission in failing to consider the issue. 
With modern data technologies, other states have found it increasingly easy to count prisoners as residents of their home district, Wessler said. The Prison Policy Initiative report cited a 2023 report by the National Conference of State Legislatures that called reconsidering where incarcerated people are counted as “the fastest growing trend in redistricting.” 
Though Wyoming won’t redistrict again until after the 2030 census, Wessler encouraged state lawmakers to begin questioning where incarcerated people should be counted now. “If they take up the issue now, it will help to make sure the state has the data it needs to successfully reallocate people back to their home communities,” he said.

Board records indicate Brittany Russell Anderson of Davenport was charged last year with engaging in unethical conduct or practices harmful to the public by performing nursing services beyond her scope of practice. A hearing on the matter was held April 9, 2025.
According to the findings of the board, Anderson was working as a hospice nurse in March 2024 when the board received a complaint from her employer — which, the board records indicate, was Compassus’  Davenport Hospice.

The board alleges the company reported Anderson had been fired after creating a purported transcription of a physician’s telephone order for patient treatment without actually speaking to the physician, Dr. Scott Eberly.
The board alleged Anderson had falsely informed a hospice nurse she had spoken with Eberly. When the nurse called Eberly to confirm the order, she learned from Eberly he hadn’t talked to Anderson. Eberly was upset over the order and subsequently contacted Anderson’s employer to discuss the issue.
Anderson allegedly admitted she had written the order without speaking to Eberly, but at her hearing explained that in March 2024 she was working seven days on and seven days off as a hospice nurse and was too busy to properly complete all of her patient-treatment documentation.
After the hearing, the board voted to suspend Anderson’s license. Although the board’s order does not specify the length of the suspension, it does state that she will be eligible for reinstatement only after completing an unspecified number of hours of continuing-education training in ethics.
Once her license is reinstated, it will be placed on probation for one year, according to board records.
In 2021, the board charged Anderson, then known as Brittany Russell, with engaging in behavior contrary to professional decorum and committing an act that might adversely affect a patient.
The board alleged that while working at an unspecified hospital in 2021, Anderson “had alcohol in her possession while on duty” and, that day, administered medication to a patient that was “in excess of what was ordered.” The board subsequently ordered her to complete seven hours of continuing education training in ethics and medication errors.
State and county records indicate Anderson was working at Davenport’s Genesis Medical Center at the time of the alleged incident.

Ruben Gallego will visit Iowa during the Iowa State Fair and hold other events in the state to talk about the impacts of the budget reconciliation bill, he announced Wednesday.
Gallego, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2024 general election, defeating Republican Kari Lake. He was previously a member of the U.S. House representing Arizona, serving from 2015 to 2025 when he took the Senate seat. He has gained some national attention for saying there is room for Democrats to work with the Trump administration on issues related to immigration and border security. Gallego, alongside Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, backed the Laken Riley Act, the immigration law moved forward earlier this year.
While Gallego has found some areas to work with Republicans, his trip to Iowa will be focused on the “big, beautiful bill” signed by President Donald Trump earlier in July. The bill makes cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, in addition to making 2017 tax cuts permanent and increasing immigration enforcement funding.

In a news release announcing the trip, Gallego’s staff said the Arizona Democrat plans to talk with voters about how the law will impact Iowans and how “leaders like Joni Ernst and Mariannette Miller-Meeks turned their back on Iowans to give billionaires yet another tax cut.”
“Like most Iowans, Ruben Gallego didn’t grow up having things handed to him — he had to work hard and pay his dues,” Raphael Chavez-Fernandez, Gallego’s chief of staff said in a statement. “That’s why he’s headed to the Hawkeye State to call out those who backed Trump’s billionaire tax scam at the expense of Iowa’s good, hard working people. Ruben’s not afraid to say the quiet part out loud: that Iowa families are getting screwed, and Iowans deserve leaders who will fight for them every single day.”
Gallego plans to speak with voters at the Iowa State Fair in a visit on Friday, Aug. 8. He also plans to hold a town hall in Scott County Aug. 9, cohosted by the Iowa Democratic Party and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Though Iowa is no longer first in the Democratic presidential nominating cycle, a politician visiting the Iowa State Fair historically indicates their interest in a presidential run. Gallego also made a visit in May to Bucks County in Pennsylvania, a swing area that Trump won in 2024. Gallego told reporters there he has received encouragement from Democrats to campaign for the presidency, but a 2028 run was not at the top of his mind.
“Has it ever crossed my mind?” Gallego said in an interview, according to NBC News. “… Of course, I’m an elected official, it crosses my mind. Am I thinking about it right now? Absolutely not.”
Gallego also headlined a virtual emergency town hall with the Alaska Democratic Party earlier in July to discuss the budget reconciliation bill.
Other Democrats who are considered potential constants for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have also made recent Iowa visits to discuss Trump and Republicans’ policies. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election, held a Des Moines event in March, and former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg spoke in Cedar Rapids in May.

Mayor Daniella Levine Cava on Tuesday urged Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to let the county, which owns the land where the detention center is located, have remote video access, schedule visits, and receive weekly site reports.
But Jeremy Redfern, Uthmeier’s communications director, responded to the letter on X Tuesday night, denying the requests.

The denial came as immigrants decried conditions at the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer detention center in the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Multiple detainees told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they had gone days without showering, the toilets didn’t flush, and temperatures fluctuated between extremes. Redfern called the reporting “fake news” on X.
However, the Florida Division of Emergency Management is in charge of the detention center, and Stephanie Hartman, its deputy director of communications, wrote to Florida Phoenix on Wednesday that it hadn’t denied Miami-Dade’s requests and that the mayor’s letter was under review.
Uthmeier publicly announced the detention center three weeks ago and has taken credit for its official state name of “Alligator Alcatraz,” which has garnered criticism from immigrant and environmental activists and indigenous leaders. He also announced the arrival of detainees on July 2.
Levine Cava has called upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide a detailed report on the five people who have died in the state while under the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The mayor urged DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to meet with local officials about the conditions at the federal detention centers in the state.
A DHS spokesperson wrote to the Phoenix on Wednesday that the department responds to inquiries such as the mayor’s through official channels.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has alleged that the Republican presidential electors assisted the Trump campaign’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Transportation released their Habitat Connectivity Action Plan last week. The strategic plan presents a statewide map of Washington’s roadways and habitats, with the goal of identifying the best places to protect and restore wildlife movement. 



The full plan is available at the WDFW website.  Interactive maps and other planning resources are available at ArcGIS online.  



	 
The plan gives Washington a shared map and tools so local planners, land owners, tribal governments and state and federal agencies can work together on the issue, said Julia Michalak, priority habitats and species manager with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
“Wildlife doesn’t stop at county lines or property fences,” she said. 
Developed in collaboration with local and tribal governments, conservation groups, and technical experts, the plan includes regional strategies tailored to the specific needs of different parts of the state. 
Local governments are encouraged to use the data in the plan for land-use planning, zoning, and guiding conservation efforts.  
The data will help the Department of Transportation plan safer roads that work better for people and wildlife, said Glen Kalisz, a habitat connectivity biologist with the agency. 
“This kind of statewide coordination allows us to identify where to focus our investments, design more effective crossings, and support healthy ecosystems across Washington,” Kalisz said. 
In the plan, the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Transportation outlined 13 landscapes that are essential for connecting core ecological areas.

The plan also identified 38 sections of state highways where actions like building wildlife crossings, installing fencing, or retrofitting culverts could offer significant benefits. 
For example, a two-mile section of U.S. Highway 2, west of Cashmere, was highlighted as a severe wildlife-related safety hazard due to a high number of vehicles hitting deer.
Between 2019 and 2023, there were 32 deer carcasses removed, 19 deer crash reports and five human injuries caused by wildlife-vehicle collisions in that stretch of road, according to the report. 
The section of highway has a large-span bridge underpass conveying the Wenatchee River, which the plan says offered a strategic and cost-effective opportunity for targeted retrofits that could allow for safer movement of deer and other wildlife. 
The report also noted a one-mile span of Interstate 90, west of Snoqualmie Pass between Keechelus and Kachess lakes. Here, I-90 bisects the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and, due to the road’s extreme traffic volume, it is considered a major barrier to wildlife. 
Improvements to that section of I-90 are included in the Snoqualmie Pass East Highway Widening Project, with four wildlife underpasses and wildlife exclusion fencing expected to be built in 2028 and 2029. 
The Cascades Conservation Partnership and the I-90 Wildlife Bridges Coalition have been working since 2000 on various projects intended to reconnect Washington’s north and south Cascades by protecting and restoring habitat and establishing safe wildlife crossings under and over I-90.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/deer-road-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

Legal and health policy experts say the court’s June ruling upholding a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors leaves the door open for other challenges — and restrictions.

The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.

The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case.


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”

Sex-based protections

The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.

‘Scientific and policy debates’

Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

As the cases of two detained immigrant advocates unfold, their experience illustrates tactics the federal government uses on non-citizens amid ballooning deportation quotas mandated by the Trump administration.

Eyes widening and darting. A stiffened body. Hands clenched on the steering wheel. No smile or wave. Plain clothing. 
These are the observations Border Patrol Agent Brandon Parent made to justify pulling over a gray Ford Transit van on Route 105 in Richford on June 14. In an affidavit written by Parent’s colleague, Parent would later state that behind the driver and passenger, he believed he saw more people in the back seats through the van’s tinted windows. Those people would turn out not to exist.
The driver of the van, 29-year-old Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz, was returning from delivering groceries at a farm near the border with Canada that Saturday morning, according to a declaration De La Cruz filed on July 6 in support of his bail proceedings. His stepdaughter, 18-year-old Heidi Perez, was in the passenger seat.

Both are from Mexico, but De La Cruz moved to Vermont in 2016 to establish his life as a dairy worker. Perez followed in 2023 and became a student at Milton High School, where she graduated a week earlier, according to court documents.
For more than three weeks since the traffic stop, both have been detained in Vermont jails by Immigration and Customs Enforcement awaiting deportation proceedings. In declarations filed this week, De La Cruz and Perez allege they were physically injured by Border Patrol agents, and that the agents threatened further harm if they did not cooperate. 
Both are arguing to be released on bail, but their proceedings have been delayed.
As De La Cruz’s and Perez’s cases continue to unfold, their experience, illustrated largely through court documents, shows some of the tactics U.S. Customs and Border Protection uses on non-citizens amid ballooning deportation quotas mandated for the Department of Homeland Security by the Trump administration.
De La Cruz and Perez are part of a record of ICE detentions that reached more than 56,000 in mid-June, according to data collected by TRAC Reports, a nonpartisan group that gathers and analyzes immigration data. More than half of those people were booked into ICE detention centers in May, according to the data clearinghouse. Less than 30% have a criminal record, and those that do often have minor offenses like traffic violations, according to TRAC. 
On Monday, during Perez’s bail hearing, Vermont District Court Judge Christina Reiss delayed Perez’s potential release, requesting more information from her attorneys and the federal government, who argued her bail should be denied. 
On Tuesday, De La Cruz’s bail hearing was postponed in response to a request by Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School who represents De La Cruz and Perez.
Criminal accusations sometimes surface after apprehensions, like in the high-profile case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador after a routine traffic stop and now faces charges of human smuggling connected to a 2022 traffic stop.

De La Cruz faces a similar accusation. After his apprehension, Border Patrol agents began a criminal investigation into his possible connection to an individual who illegally crossed the U.S.-Canada border into Vermont in April. He has not been charged.
“There’s somewhat of a trend nationally that in these high-profile cases, the charges and allegations come after the fact,” Stokes said. “It’s not uncommon to see subsequent charges like this.”
While most immigrants in ICE detainment are transferred to bigger facilities outside Vermont in states like Louisiana and Texas, which together hold more than a third of ICE detainees, De La Cruz and Perez remain in the state’s detention system largely because their own immigration advocacy work meant they knew their legal rights and an attorney was quickly contacted on their behalf. Their attorney helped them file petitions alleging their arrest was unlawful and each received a temporary restraining order to remain in Vermont instead of being transferred out of state. 
Those transfers, common during the second Trump administration, can limit an immigrant’s access to both legal representation and the moral support of their communities, and can serve as a quicker route to deportation, according to advocates and legal experts.

Though De La Cruz’s encounter with Border Patrol agents appeared to be by chance, the situation soon escalated. After De La Cruz was taken to the Richford Border Patrol Station, a Border Patrol investigator noted similarities between De La Cruz’s name, location, and phone number with an individual who allegedly helped a Mexican citizen enter Vermont from Canada in April. 
The government filed a search warrant for his cellphone, and his black Samsung has been in federal possession since, but no criminal charges have been filed.
“Border Patrol’s recent allegations do not change the essential fact that Nacho and Heidi were detained without cause while delivering food to farmworkers,” Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice, a Vermont-based advocacy organization for immigrant workers, said in a statement on the search warrant.
“Border Patrol claims that Nacho had previously made a plan to give a ride to a woman who was planning on immigrating to the United States without authorization. If true, this incident is wholly unrelated to the actual circumstances of their violent detainment,” Lambek said.
The legal obligation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to protect a porous border with Canada overlaps with the escalating demands on ICE. While both agencies are under the Department of Homeland Security, ICE recently became the country’s largest federally-funded law enforcement  program after the passage of President Donald Trump’s omnibus budget bill last week.
While ICE operations have expanded under the Trump administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the operations of Border Patrol have remained the same. In both De La Cruz’s search warrant and Garcia’s case, ICE is not a party in the investigation or legal case, though the agency holds the detainees while their deportation proceedings play out.
In response to a detailed list of questions from VTDigger, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael Niezgoda wrote in an emailed statement that because the matters “all relate to an ongoing criminal prosecution, court proceeding, or immigration hearing currently being litigated in the District of Vermont District Court or Immigration Court,” it is his agency’s policy not to comment. 
Stokes said neither De La Cruz nor Perez are being criminally prosecuted.
The traffic stop
Border Agent Brandon Parent was parked on Drew Road, a rural lane in Franklin County that dead ends at a dairy farm split in half by the international border with Canada. 
Agents like Parent monitor the border with Canada in uniform from marked vehicles under the mission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an agency in the Department of Homeland Security established after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. The main mission of the agency is to stop terrorists from entering the country, according to Ryan Brissette, a public affairs specialist for the New England region of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Vermont.
Legally, individuals can only enter the U.S. through a port of entry. If they enter by another means, they must report directly to Border Patrol and could be subject to arrest until they do so. Those individuals can then be transferred to ICE jurisdiction if the U.S. government determines they need to go through deportation proceedings. 
“The only time we really engage with ICE is when we have someone being removed,” Brissette said in a phone call unrelated to this case. Enforcement and Removal Operations, an agency under ICE, can apprehend the individual if they do not have legal status in the U.S.

But in order to pull over a vehicle in Vermont with Vermont plates, like the one De La Cruz was driving on June 14, an agent must have reasonable suspicion that the driver or passengers in the vehicle have committed an immigration violation or federal crime. If they don’t have probable cause, both the driver and passenger have the right to remain silent and not answer questions about their immigration status, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, a nonprofit civil rights organization with a chapter in Vermont.
In an affidavit filed by Border Patrol after the encounter, Parent said he observed that De La Cruz’s “arms and hands appeared clenched and rigid on the steering wheel.” He declared he hadn’t previously seen the car on Drew Road, where residents were “generally friendly and supportive” of agents like himself, and he was typically acknowledged “with a smile, head nod, or a wave.” De La Cruz and Perez were wearing plain clothing and didn’t appear to be local farm workers, Parent noted. They didn’t make a full stop when exiting Drew Road.
Parent observed that these behaviors were “often seen in subjects engaged in suspicious behavior upon noticing law enforcement.” When he began tailing the vehicle, he said he thought he saw people in the back through the van’s tinted windows.
Stokes determined these observations could amount to racial profiling. He laid out this argument in a writ of habeas corpus, a petition asking the court to review their unlawful detention, filed two days after their apprehension.

Parent contacted Swanton Sector Dispatch and matched the license plate to Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, a 29-year-old who lived in Milton. Parent stated in the affidavit filed by his colleague, David T. Palczewski, that he believed “alien smugglers were possibly using vehicles with Vermont license plates to blend in with the local population.”
He pulled the van over at 12:07 p.m. He quickly saw that there were no additional people in the back, as he had previously believed.
De La Cruz asked why he was stopped, but Parent did not give a reason and requested his driver’s license, according to the Border Patrol affidavit and declarations filed this week by De La Cruz and Perez.
“The officer then said, in broken Spanish, that the fact that I spoke Spanish and did not understand English was enough for the stop,” De La Cruz wrote in his declaration. He said Parent tried to open the driver’s door but it was locked.
Two additional supervisory Border Patrol agents appeared on scene — Thomas Blaser and William Haffley — who ordered De La Cruz to step out of the car.

De La Cruz then called the Migrant Justice emergency hotline, and handed the phone to Perez, according to his declaration. In the Border Patrol affidavit, Parent reported that the two refused to effectively communicate and called others on their cellphones.
Marita Canedo, a Migrant Justice spokesperson, was on the line with Perez. During a rally protesting the detainment of De La Cruz and Perez in June, she said, “Nacho did everything that he knew to defend his rights.”
The American Civil Liberties Union recommends that if police, ICE, or Border Patrol pull over an individual while in transit that they stay calm, open the window part way, and if they don’t have immigration papers, tell the official they want to remain silent. 
De La Cruz stated in his declaration that he rolled his window down just enough to hear the officer, and then asked why they were detained and if they were free to go four separate times. After the fourth time, Border Patrol agent Blaser used a duty-issued baton to break the driver side window and remove him. De La Cruz stated that “glass shattered and hit the left side of my face, causing an injury to my head and left ear.”
After agents pulled De La Cruz from the car, Perez left voluntarily from the passenger seat, Perez wrote in her declaration. De La Cruz shook his head at Perez, warning her not to speak, according to the Border Patrol affidavit. 
They took the pair to the Richford Border Patrol Station, according to the Border Patrol affidavit. There, De La Cruz and Perez note in their declarations that they asked to make phone calls and were denied. De La Cruz was told to sign documents, according to his declaration, and when he refused, he said one of the officers said in Spanish, “You are going back to fucking Mexico, you don’t have any documents, you don’t have the right to make a phone call.”
When Perez refused to give personal information, an officer “grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her back, causing her visible pain and injuring her nails,” De La Cruz wrote. “He only stopped when another officer told him to.” He was told through an interpreter that he needed to convince his stepdaughter to cooperate and “that if she continued to refuse, they would hurt her until she complied,” De La Cruz declared in court records.
“The interpreter added that they did not want to hurt her again but would do so if it became necessary. He also said that they had children and would not want anyone to harm their own children,” De La Cruz wrote.
The two were separated and placed in different cells. De La Cruz agreed to give fingerprints and DNA when he was told that, if he cooperated, he could be reunited with Perez, he noted in his declaration.

While they were apprehended, David T. Palczewski, the prosecution agent for Richford, received an email noting the apprehension of two subjects during a traffic stop with a vehicle registered to De La Cruz out of Milton. 
He thought he recognized the name. In the affidavit he filed a week later, Palczewski wrote that he advised agents that De La Cruz was a possible match to a phone number noted in a deportation case where a woman communicated with someone named “Nacho” for assistance in crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Agents seized De La Cruz’s cellphone and kept it at the Richford station after he was transferred to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans.
Two days later, Palczewski said he used his government-issued cellphone to call the number associated with that case and De La Cruz’s cellphone rang. A day later, Palczewski wrote that through “open-source reporting” he learned De La Cruz goes by “Nacho.”
“By the agent’s own admission, Border Patrol did not connect the alleged incident to Nacho until after he was stopped and detained without cause,” Lambek said. Lambek noted that the stated reasons for the traffic stop “only strengthen our belief that this was an act of racial profiling, pure and simple, in violation of Heidi and Nacho’s constitutional rights.”
Neither De La Cruz nor Perez have a criminal history, but a criminal investigation into De La Cruz began. 
The phone number
A week after the traffic stop, Palczewski filed a search warrant for De La Cruz’s cellphone. 
The warrant and attached affidavit alleged that De La Cruz was the same person as an individual called “Nacho” who tried helping Yoselin Gonzalez-Flores, a Mexican citizen, cross the border from Canada into northern Vermont between April 9 and 11. Nacho intended to pick up Gonzalez around midnight on April 11 at a Mobil Gas Station in Saratoga Springs, New York, and bring her to a house in Burlington, according to the affidavit. 
But by 3:44 a.m. on April 11, according to the affidavit, Gonzalez texted the number associated with a person named Nacho and said she would not be crossing near Saratoga Springs. Instead, she would travel to Montreal and cross through the woods.
Gonzalez crossed the border on the night of April 18, according to the affidavit. Around 10 p.m., the crossing activated cameras near Berry Road in Franklin County. A few hours later, on April 19, she was apprehended with three others, along with two people in a minivan who intended to pick up the individuals after crossing, according to a criminal complaint that details Gonzalez’s apprehension. None of those people were De La Cruz.
Gonzalez waved her Miranda rights and turned over her cellphone to Border Patrol agents, according to the criminal complaint. Her phone showed WhatsApp messages in Spanish between herself and the person called Nacho, according to the affidavit.
Stokes called the warrant a “fishing expedition” in line with what’s happened in other cases of detainees being retaliated against by the Department of Homeland Security. 
“The fact remains that all this is is a warrant to search his phone for evidence of something that may or may not be there,” Stokes said of the search warrant. “I don’t know where the allegations and charges are coming from, but the fact remains that we stand with Nacho, and we believe Nacho.”

But three days later, Gonzalez was deported, along with another individual who crossed, according to the complaint. VTDigger contacted the lawyers associated with the Gonzalez case, but Gonzalez’s location was unknown at the time of publication. 
Agents may have focused on the area surrounding Berry Road, near where Gonzalez was apprehended on Richford Road, because, according to the criminal complaint, it has “recently experienced a significant uptick in illicit cross-border activity.” 
But northern border crossings overall have plummeted in 2025, according to data collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In May, the agency encountered 5,063 people at the northern border, less than a third of the 18,663 people border officials encountered in May 2024. 
While crossings have dropped, border officials still detain people crossing illegally. U.S. Border Patrol’s Swanton Sector apprehended hundreds of people between Feb. 1 and May 31, 2025, according to a social media post made by Robert Garcia, the sector’s chief patrol agent.
“Despite the significant decrease in cross border apprehensions, Swanton Sector has apprehended over 300 individuals from 45 different countries,” Garcia wrote, noting the majority were from India, Mexico, and Ecuador.
Gonzalez was arrested near Pleasant Valley Farms, according to a map depicting the encounter in the criminal complaint.

Two days later, border agents entered that farm, the largest dairy in Vermont, and arrested eight immigrant farm workers who lived and worked on site after a report from concerned citizens of two individuals leaving the woods near the U.S.-Canada border, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection statement.
“We’re still catching a lot of questions about targeting migrant workers on dairy farmers,” Brissette said in a phone call unrelated to De La Cruz’s case. “If we come across someone who is here illegally they’ll get arrested. But we’re not targeting those individuals.” 
All eight farm workers were from Mexico, according to Migrant Justice, and at least four have since been deported. Two were released on bail and returned to Vermont. At least one, Jesus Mendez Hernandez, remains at the Karnes County Immigration Processing Center in Texas. 
The location of the eighth, Adrian Zunun-Joachin, was not available in a locator system provided by ICE. But Stokes, his attorney, said Zunun had told him in previous conversations that he was considering abandoning the fight to stay in the U.S. and instead return to Mexico. Stokes said he was likely deported. 
The hearings
On Tuesday, roughly a hundred protesters gathered in front of a federal courthouse in Burlington at a rally hosted by Migrant Justice to support De La Cruz. This was the second rally in two days, after protestors gathered to support the bail hearing for Perez on Monday. 
Perez spent roughly three weeks at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility before her bail was deferred. A new court date was not set by Wednesday morning. Perez has been in Vermont since she crossed into the U.S. in February 2023 when she was 16 years old. De La Cruz, who also has a 3-year-old son — a U.S. citizen born in Vermont — entered the U.S. without crossing a legal port of entry in 2016, and again in 2022 after briefly returning to Mexico. 
Wuendy Bernardo, an undocumented farmer and immigrant advocate, attended the rally on Tuesday and reflected on a time when she was detained with her children.“I was detained too, along with my children, and it’s not easy being locked up in jail,” Bernardo said. “It’s not fair because we come here to work, we contribute here, to this state, to this country, and it’s not fair that they’re locked up.”
De La Cruz and Perez remain in Vermont because they and their attorney alleged that Border Patrol agents lacked reasonable suspicion for the traffic stop, violating their constitutional rights. De La Cruz is being punished “for his Mexican-descent and disfavored speech,” Stokes wrote in court documents.

A judge recently extended a temporary restraining order to keep De La Cruz and Perez in Vermont. It now lasts until July 31. 
While De La Cruz’s cellphone remains in the hands of Border Patrol, according to Stokes, the agency hadn’t pressed criminal charges in the weeks since searching the cellphone’s emails, texts, maps, photos, videos, Internet browsing and search history, geolocations, contact lists and financial transactions.
“I don’t know where it’s going to end up,” Stokes said. “But ultimately, it’s directly out of the authoritarian playbook.”

Three people were killed and other chaos ensued late Tuesday due to flooding. (Photo courtesy NWS) Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is calling on the federal government to assist state and local authorities as they respond to floods in Ruidoso that killed three people and caused other chaos late Tuesday night.
The people killed are a man in his 40s to 50s, plus children ages 7 and 4, according to the Village of Ruidoso. A news release states monsoon rains falling in burn scar areas caused a flash flood that caught all three and carried them downstream as the Rio Ruidoso rose to a record-breaking 20 feet. 
The National Weather Service collected incident reports that echo that news release, reporting that at 9:44 p.m. a “father and two children [were] washed away” and that swiftwater rescue teams were in pursuit. At 11:35 p.m., about two miles downstream, the service received another report of “1 adult 2 children trapped and needing rescue.”
Ruidoso and Mescalero officials seek state help as communities face post-fire flooding

The NWS received reports from emergency managers and other verified sources of more than 35 flash-flood related incidents between 9 p.m. and 11:45 p.m. in and around Ruidoso, showing the sheer chaos the floods caused and providing terse descriptions of dramatic rescues and lives already upended. 
The reports include an “RV destroyed” with “people trapped in debris” at 10:05 p.m.; a house floating down the river behind Downshift brewery; “multiple rescues at Gavilan Trailer Park”; and an “elderly female trapped in need of rescue,” among others.
The chaos marks the latest round of flash floods in the area following last summer’s South Fork and Salt fires. Monsoon rains that fall on high-intensity wildfire burn scars tend not to absorb into the watershed and instead run on top of hydrophobic soil. That can cause flash floods and debris flows that slough off mountainsides where vegetation no longer exists.
Lujan Grisham’s office Tuesday evening issued a news release that said she had sought a presidential disaster declaration, which empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies to provide assistance to families and public entities responding to the disaster. 
“Ruidoso endured devastating wildfires and flooding last summer, and now catastrophic flooding is hitting this resilient community again,” she said. “This crisis demands immediate action…New Mexico is mobilizing every resource we have, but Ruidoso needs federal support to recover from this disaster. We’ve watched Texas receive the federal resources they desperately needed, and Ruidoso deserves that same urgent response.”
Later Wednesday, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on President Donald Trump to approve the request, writing in a letter that “70 distinct pieces of critical infrastructure have been damaged,” including roads and bridges, drainage systems and at least eight public buildings. 
“It is imperative that the federal government provides full support needed for New Mexico communities to respond and recover,” the delegation wrote. “Anything less would leave families vulnerable and prolong the suffering of those already facing unimaginable loss.”
Six bridges damaged in Ruidoso disaster had been awaiting repairs from flood 16 years ago

Lujan Grisham’s request for a disaster declaration is the first her office has announced New Mexico since Trump took office, though state emergency management officials have said they were considering one for the Trout Fire burning north of Silver City. 
Trump has publicly mused about dismantling FEMA or heavily slashing its budget. He also initially denied an April disaster declaration request following tornadoes in Nebraska, a state where Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders is governor. 
Trump did approve Texas’ request for a disaster declaration following flooding there that’s killed more than 100 people. 
The most severe flooding happened here in New Mexico just a day after Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told state lawmakers the village needed more help to address flooding in the aftermath of last year’s South Fork and Salt fires.
On Tuesday, tragedy hit, and Crawford issued a statement offering condolences:
“Our hearts are broken for the families who have lost their loved ones in this terrible tragedy,” Crawford said. “The entire Village of Ruidoso extends our deepest sympathy and compassion to these grieving families during this unimaginably difficult time. We are united in our sorrow and our commitment to supporting one another as we face this devastating loss together.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvXgu_JWAAAaRx9-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

Data shows that many of those in immigration detention have no criminal history. (Photo by by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) Thirty-four cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda.
The expansion of the case could be a sign that more cities are seeing the benefit of suing to protect their rights in court from a Trump administration that is often acting without regard for legal precedent. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits nationwide injunctions means that cities and states must be part of a lawsuit to get the benefits of any injunction that would stop such policies while the legal merits are debated in court.
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

The federal judge in the case, William Orrick of the U.S. District Court of Northern California, did issue an injunction April 24, telling Trump administration it couldn’t use executive orders to withhold federal funding from the original 15 cities and counties in the lawsuit. Orrick updated the injunction June 23 to include later policy memos tying “all new federal awards” to immigration compliance. The Trump administration said it would appeal the injunction.
“It appears that the defendants continue to seek an end run around the preliminary injunction,” Orrick wrote in June. Orrick left the door open for the administration to withhold funds directly tied to illegal immigration, but he said the administration still must make a case that there’s a real connection between immigration and other issues — especially with seemingly unrelated programs like highway and housing funds.
If the new cities and counties are accepted into the lawsuit, there would be a total of 50 localities in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.










Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.


– Jonathan Miller, attorney for counties and cities suing over funding threats 


The Supreme Court decision in Trump v. CASA, limiting nationwide injunctions, now “creates more impetus in this litigation and in others for more parties to seek relief to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
Generally, the local sanctuary policies at stake are those that limit cooperation with “detainers” asking local law enforcement authorities to hold arrested people in jail up to two days after they would otherwise go free, on behalf of federal immigration investigations. Some states and localities limit cooperation with the detainers, and some require cooperation.
“[Trump officials] are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting local governments to do their bidding and this case is pushback against that,” Miller said. “Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.”
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

In a March filing, attorneys for the Trump administration defended the planned funding cutoffs as part of the president’s Jan. 20 executive order to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’ which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.”
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, in a response to a reporter’s question that was posted July 8 by the White House, said the administration is determined than ever to go after cities that don’t fully cooperate.
“We’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because they’re a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is,” Homan said. “We know they’re releasing public safety threats.”
According to June numbers obtained by the TRAC data clearinghouse at the University of Syracuse, nearly 44% of people held in immigration detention have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses such as traffic violations. The rest were detained based on pending charges or purely immigration-related offenses such as crossing the border in secret.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Dozens of teachers laid off. Every administrator gone. Major cuts to high school programs.
That’s what it would theoretically take for Deer Creek Public Schools to comply with a recent order that all Oklahoma public schools provide free meals to every student this school year, the district’s superintendent, Jason Perez, said. 
“It’s not within the realm of possibility, not unless we are willing to make such drastic changes to our basic tenets of how we educate students in this district,” Perez said.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters on Monday ordered all public schools in the state to offer universal free meals starting in the 2025-26 academic year, claiming districts could afford it by cutting administrator salaries. 
“Parents already pay for lunches when the federal and local government tax them,” Walters said in a statement. “They shouldn’t be taxed again with a lunch invoice.”

Walters’ order, which caught many in the state’s public education system by surprise a month before the next school year begins, has been met with significant doubts of whether such a mandate is legally, financially or logistically viable.
Perez, along with other district leaders and education experts, noted that no Oklahoma law requires public schools to fund cafeteria meals for every student, particularly those whose household income is high enough that they don’t qualify for federally supported free or reduced-price meals. 
The Oklahoma State School Boards Association pointed out that no state law permits Walters to sanction districts, as he has threatened to do, for not providing free meals to all enrolled. The association’s executive director, Shawn Hime, said the choice to offer free breakfasts and lunches is “strictly a local decision.”
Districts also would need to update their kitchens for scratch cooking, train their staff and have access to local ingredient sources to comply with Walters’ demand that school meals eliminate “ultra-processed” foods, certain artificial dyes, seed oils and produce grown with pesticides, the School Nutrition Association of Oklahoma wrote in a letter to the state superintendent.
“Mandating these changes without supporting infrastructure or funding risks overburdening already strained schools and child nutrition departments and potentially reduces access to meals altogether if programs cannot remain compliant,” the association wrote.
Some states have implemented universal free meals in all of their public schools, but each has done so by increasing funding for this initiative, according to Hunger Free Oklahoma, an organization that advocates for expanding access to affordable, nutritious food.
The most recent available state records show Oklahoma public schools spent $440.6 million on child nutrition in the 2024 fiscal year. The vast majority of funding for school food services, almost $311 million, came from the federal government. About $3 million came from the state. 
Schools generated another $42.4 million in revenue from meal sales, adult meal purchases, summer food service, gifts and donations, and other food service income.
Walters said Oklahoma schools already receive enough state and federal funding that they could stop charging families for meals, but instead they spend too much money on administrators.
Oklahoma districts collectively spent $670 million on general administration and school administration in the 2022-23 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
State law already places a limit on administrative spending in public schools. Districts with more than 1,500 students can spend no more than 5% of their annual expenditures on administrative costs.
Even if Deer Creek eliminated all administrator salaries, the district still would fall $4.5 million short of the cost to provide free meals for each of its 8,100 students, Perez said. That means the rest would have to come out of the district’s general fund, the vast majority of which goes to personnel salaries and benefits.

This would put the district’s most attractive qualities, small class sizes and high-quality teachers, on the chopping block, he said. Federal aid is limited for Deer Creek, a more affluent district where less than a quarter of students qualify for free and reduced-price school meals.
Perez said he believes “wholeheartedly” in the idea of no-cost meals for all students. Doing so, he said, is what’s best for children and would lead to better educational outcomes.
“I don’t think there’s anybody that would be against it, but there’s a right way to do this that is thoughtful and that’s actually going to lead to a sustainable end result that we can carry on for years to come,” Perez said. “And then, there are forced mandates that come out overnight, that have no bearing and have had no opportunity for feedback from educators, from legislators, from community members as to the feasibility of it. And that’s what we’re dealing with right now.”
For now, Perez said his district will prepare as usual for the school year, which starts Aug. 14 in Deer Creek.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education has not sent formal guidance to districts about Walters’ mandate, Edmond Public Schools spokesperson Jeff Bardach said.
The state agency so far has issued a news release, a letter to public school families and a petition collecting signatures from supporters of the policy. 
About a third of Edmond’s 25,700 students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, Bardach said. Another third pay to eat at their cafeteria, collectively spending $3.5 million on breakfasts and lunches. 
  Edmond Public Schools would incur millions of dollars in added costs if it started offering cafeteria meals for free, a spokesperson said. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
A final third seemingly brings packed lunches from home, he said, because they don’t qualify for federal aid nor set up an account to pay for school meals. 
District administrators could only guess how many more students would start eating school-provided meals once the food is free for everyone, Bardach said, but the added expense is sure to be in the millions.
“The only real way to know how much it would cost is to do it for a year and see how much it costs,” Bardach said. “If you do that, you can’t preemptively make the cuts to cover it because you don’t know what you’re cutting for, what number you’re trying to get to.”
The financial impact would be “significant” in Norman Public Schools, as well, chief communications officer Courtney Scott said. 
The district’s $6.5 million child nutrition program relies, in part, on payments from families who don’t qualify for free or reduced-price meals. The district would have to raise $1.7 million a year to make up the difference of that lost revenue.
“Covering this gap would likely require cuts to other parts of the budget, which could impact student programs and services,” Scott said.
The timing of Walters’ announcement indicates he’s “trying to score political points” rather than help children, said Rick Cobb, superintendent of Midwest City-Del City Public Schools.

Every district in the state already built its budget for the 2025-26 school year, as they are required to do by June 30, he said. Now, a month before the next school year, Walters is demanding districts submit budgets with the cost of free meals factored in. 
The order also came a week after a deadline to apply for a federal program that could help cover some of the cost of student meals. 
The program, known as the Community Eligibility Provision, helps districts that choose to offer free meals schoolwide or districtwide. Participating districts must have at least 25% of their students on Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other federal benefits to qualify.
Midwest City-Del City schools is one of 256 districts in Oklahoma that provide free meals to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision. Another 264 districts qualify but don’t participate, often because of financial challenges, according to a June report from Hunger Free Oklahoma.
Cobb said districts with a lower poverty rate “are going to be out millions” if they’re forced to cover universal free meals without more financial support.
“The timing of it is bad,” Cobb said. “The motive behind it seems iffy. Even though it’s not really going to affect us here in Mid-Del, I don’t like the idea of the state superintendent coming out with a mandate in July that can totally upend school districts’ budgets.”

Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.

As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

The Republican previously served in the Kansas Senate. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt launched Wednesday a campaign to win the Republican Party’s nomination for governor.
Schmidt worked for more than four decades as a pharmacist and served in the Kansas Senate before elected state insurance commissioner in 2018. She was reelected in 2022 by a wide margin.
“Throughout my personal and professional career, I have a track record of serving Kansans and actually getting things done,” Schmidt said in a statement. “If elected governor, my top priority is the people of Kansas and making their lives better.”
Schmidt joined other prominent Republicans, including former Gov. Jeff Colyer and Secretary of State Scott Schwab, in the GOP primary scheduled for August 2026.
Colyer, who became governor in 2018 after resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback to take a position in the first administration of President Donald Trump, said Schmidt’s candidacy wouldn’t deter his effort to unite the Kansas GOP behind a pro-Trump agenda.
“Welcome to the race, Vicki Schmidt,” Colyer’ statement said. “Never Trumpers deserve a candidate, too.”
Interest in the 2026 contest for Kansas governor will be driven by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s inability to seek reelection to a third term.
Schmidt’s statement said as insurance commissioner she lowered business costs by more than $75 million. She asserted she was known for “her work ethic, scrutiny of government operations and customer service approach to serving Kansans.”

Maybe. 
That was the feeling among some of the 175 registered voters from across the commonwealth recruited for the recent America in One Room/Pennsylvania deliberative polling experiment at the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown. 
The in-person forum was the 160th deliberative democracy event (some live, others virtual) organized by Stanford University’s Deliberative Democracy Lab since 2003. It was also the first one on the state level in two decades, according to the Lab’s founder, Director James Fishkin. 
“Pennsylvania is a crucial state politically from every standpoint, and will likely continue to be so,” Fishkin said. “I think this is a very good microcosm, to see what the people of Pennsylvania, when they gather and think together about the issues in an evidence- based civil environment, actually think should be done.”
Deliberative polling basically entails surveying people, convening them to discuss the issues at hand with the support of facilitators and educational materials, and then surveying them again. In addition to getting a sense of policy positions, organizers use the results to gauge whether deliberation changed participants’ stances. 
For some attendees, it did. To what extent depended upon the issue and specific proposal, according to the results provided by organizers.
Responses indicated an increased respect for and understanding of people with different viewpoints. 
One of the most drastic changes came in the participants’ outlook on the state of democracy: from 75% reporting dissatisfaction at the outset to 54% at the end of the long weekend June 5-8.  
While dissatisfaction was still the majority opinion, it was an optimistic outcome, overall, to participant Christopher Chau. 
“At the end of day, it’s a listening experiment,” said Chau, a 28-year-old lawyer from Bensalem in Bucks County. “We’re all in a group together. We all have different opinions. Let’s see if we can seek to understand each other without belittling or insulting each other.”

How to deliberate 
Organizers say recruitment of participants “was designed” to produce a representative sample of registered voters in Pennsylvania in terms of age, race, gender, geography, educational attainment and party registration. They didn’t provide a detailed demographic breakdown, despite multiple requests for one. 
Participants seemed to manage to avoid shouting matches as they delved into health, housing, education, immigration, foreign policy, criminal justice, election administration and other topics. 
To some, the cordiality came down – in part – to the tendency to behave and be polite among strangers. The desire to listen, learn and be heard – that many said brought them there in the first place – also played a role. 
Attendees met in groups of about a dozen people to discuss a slate of policies pertaining to a given topic (or a cluster of topics), under the guidance of a moderator, for an hour. Then, they spent 30 minutes coming up with questions to pose to experts and policymakers during panels with the larger entire group for another 90 minutes or so. 
This cycle repeated five times starting Thursday evening through Sunday afternoon. 
“At the very last day of the event, people were just kind of checked out,” Chau said. “They were … tired [and] drained from being bombarded with so much information at once.”
Still, Chau and others said they’d hoped to gain new insights and learn about perspectives different from their own, in addition to sharing their views. And they said the experience did deliver in that regard. 
The event concluded with a survey of at least 97 questions. A few weeks later, organizers provided the media with the aggregated responses, excluding at least one about pre-canvassing ballots (election directors have made futile appeals to the legislature about this issue for years) after Votebeat flagged inaccurate information provided to participants about potential pitfalls of the proposal.
Part of the goal is to involve people who might not normally be heard or thinking deeply about certain issues on a regular basis because, “they’re busy going about their days,” said Fishkin.
Often, those who are highly and frequently engaged tend to hold more extreme views at either end of the political spectrum, he said.
“Should they be the only ones listened to?” he said. “I don’t think so.”

Proposals in progress  
Organizers say they’ll now forward results to policymakers to use to shape their proposals. 
Prior to the event, State House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) agreed to use the data to inform her 98-page election reform bill.
“It’s my big, beautiful bill,” McClinton quipped during her address to participants.
The measure already squeaked through the chamber with a party-line vote in mid May, but would come back for a concurrence vote if it passes the Senate. 
“The Senate gets an opportunity to chop it up or keep it whole,” McClinton told the Capital-Star. “When it comes back to the House, that’s an opportunity to enhance and improve that legislation.” 
The Senate State Government Committee now has the measure. Republican Chairman Cris Dush’s spokesman Ty McCauslin didn’t respond to emails asking when or whether it would move again. 
McClinton’s HB1396 covers a lot of ground, from drop-box security cameras to spelling out how the Pennsylvania Department of State can secure up to $60 million in state funding for voting equipment. 
The agenda during the event’s “Promise of America” block included some of the measure’s proposals. Surveys showed moderate consensus among participants and that support increased slightly after they learned and discussed them. 
McClinton said she was “heartened” by those results and the “valuable insight” they provide about what her constituents think. 
“Now, my team and I can use the report’s findings while we work with stakeholders and our partners in the Senate to advance my legislation, and ensure it ultimately reflects what Pennsylvanians want,” she said in an emailed statement. 
Video monitoring of ballot drop boxes, for example, got approval from 68% of participants at the end of the weekend, up from 62% initially. 
Here’s a breakdown of support: 

Dropped from 74% to 73% among people who identified as Republican or Republican-leaning
Increased among Democrats/those leaning Democrat from half to 59%
Increased among Independents from 68% to more than three-quarters

But, drop box surveillance sparked debate in at least a couple breakout sessions. 
Chau’s group raised privacy concerns, noting the secrecy afforded by a voting booth curtain and skepticism about the prevalence of voter fraud.
“We don’t need a camera in our face for every single thing that we do,” Chau said. “Especially in the age of evolving technology [and] artificial intelligence, what happens to this data? What happens to this footage? Is it really going to be used for the purposes that the government says it’s going to be used for? Or can it be used for something else?” 
Sarah Dewey, an actress from Bristol in Bucks County, said the suggestion was a non-issue for her and others in her breakout group. 
“What are you gonna do? Watch me drop my piece of paper in a box?” Dewey said. “Our entire group was, like, ‘What’s the problem with this?’”
Organizers say they’ll provide a report for McClinton (it wasn’t released to the media) based on a qualitative analysis of recorded audio of breakout sessions to summarize concerns that surveys don’t capture.

Big swings, strong support 
Some of the most striking results dealt with election and civic engagement topics not included in HB1396.
For example, participants overwhelmingly supported penalties for misleading or intimidating voters: more than 90% at the outset and 87% at the end of the event. Still, concerns came up during at least a few breakout sessions. 
“I have seen firsthand how laws can be used and weaponized against others,” said Oliva Leposa, an adjunct professor from Croydon in Bucks County with a background in neuroscience and clinical research. “I don’t conceal carry all the time. But if I have a legal, registered firearm on me, and I go to drop off a ballot, and someone thinks that I’m intimidating them because they can see the outline of my weapon through my coat or whatever… even though I was following the law, but you think that I was intimidating you. I could go to jail for what is essentially a thought crime?”

Participants strongly supported term limits. About three-quarters favor a cap of 18 years on federal judges’ tenures. And 78% support the general concept (duration wasn’t specified) for state lawmakers. 
The most dramatic changes in participants’ reported stances came on ranked-choice voting, a system where voters rank all candidates in order of preference instead of choosing just one. 
The number of people who took a position (versus opting out) increased about 25 percentage points across three separate questions on the topic. That didn’t establish much consensus, though. And it seemed like participants who knew least about the process at the outset tended to be less keen on the idea after learning more. 
That point held up for participants, who indicated confusion, lack of consensus or both in their breakout groups. 
“Most people didn’t really understand it [initially] and then once it was explained, some people were still saying, ‘Well, what’s wrong with what we currently have?’” said Guy Dunn, an entrepreneur based in Philadelphia’s Drexel Hill. “I don’t think it moved anybody to say, ‘OK, that’s what I want.’ It was more, ‘It may work in some areas, but I’m not really sure it’s necessary to make that drastic a change.’”
Other takeaways 
Relative to some other topics, the agenda for election issues seemed tightly focused. 
A segment called “Free, Fair, Safe”, for example, simultaneously presented for discussion:  

youth-run, school-based courts
social media restrictions for minors
educational incentives for people on parole 
grants for people who lose their jobs to automation 
sanctuary cities and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

Several participants said they faced too much content to consider for the time allotted. 
“I felt like we couldn’t have quality debate, because we were always having to move on,” Sarah Dewey said.
Marshall Lerner, a retired business executive now serving as a zoning commissioner in Westtown Township, Chester County, said he’d prefer to take more time to, “get into the weeds.”
“It kind of defeated some of the purpose of why they brought people together,” said Lerner, who’s been involved in Republican politics for nearly 50 years starting in New York and New Jersey before moving to Pennsylvania. “I think they’d do better with a more committed, less ambitious approach.”
Dunn said he thought the structure was sufficient for the task at hand. 
“The reality is, you only have a certain amount of time. And some people can talk forever,” he said. 
The Deliberative Democracy Lab’s Fishkin acknowledged the agenda was ambitious, though a comparably broad program had worked well for a prior event held in New York City. 
“It’s a tradeoff. If we want to cover another issue area, because we think it’s really important to people, or would be important to people if they discussed it, versus overburdening them,” Fishkin said. “There were changes of opinion across all the issue areas, so [participants] were obviously thinking about the issues and engaged by them.”
In addition to a tighter topical agenda, participants interviewed by the Capital-Star said future state-focused events should more comprehensively cite sources for informational materials and create informal socializing to foster connections and afford a break from the intellectual intensity of the work.  
And they would prefer prompter, more direct payment of the $750 stipend. A few participants who spoke to the Capital-Star said they hadn’t been paid for attending a month later. 
Dewey, 45, said it seemed like participation by younger adults (18 to 30 years old) was quite thin, though acknowledged the most active voters skew older. 
The Philadelphia experiment was the first state-focused one under the America in One Room brand, which was established in 2019 with the engagement of the Helena Group alongside the Lab (formerly the Center for Deliberative Democracy) to help convene and fundraise. Some of these events have been topical such as the 2019 summit focused on energy.  Earlier on, the lab ran state-focused deliberative experiments in California and Michigan. 
Organizers have said the Pennsylvania convening cost in the “seven figures”.

Nessel announced Tuesday that she was joining a coalition to support the plaintiffs in Perdomo v. Noem, which seeks a temporary restraining order preventing ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection from stopping people unlawfully when ICE and CBP conduct raids.
The attorney general’s office said in a news release that the administration of President Donald Trump has engaged in aggressive, militaristic action with federal law enforcement, chilling the Los Angeles community’s participation in civil society and impeding public safety.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Allowing these tactics in Los Angeles sets a dangerous and unacceptable precedent – one that could easily spread to states like Michigan, where ICE raids have already shaken communities,” Nessel said in a statement. “When masked, heavily armed federal agents operate with no identification, they threaten public safety and erode public trust. I stand with my colleagues in confronting these unlawful practices now before they become the new normal.”
In an amicus brief filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Nessel and a coalition of various attorneys general supported the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. The plaintiffs allege that ICE and CBP have a policy that encourages unconstitutional stops based on racial profiling, and not based on reasonable suspicion that a crime has taken place.
The coalition consists of Nessel and the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. 
It argues that preliminary injunctive relief was necessary because ICE and CBP’s actions have harmed local economies, public health and other key facets of daily life. The coalition also argued that the agencies’ tactics – including the wearing of masks and concealing the identity of the agency they work – impede local law enforcement and threaten public safety.
Overall, the group asserts that the dragnet style of immigration enforcement from the Trump administration has led to U.S. citizens being caught up in raids and has created a culture of fear.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-121502-1024x676.png,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

Melissa Schmidt, R-Eldridge, speaks on the House floor in February about her foster benefits bill (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).After Aug. 28, Missouri will end the state’s longstanding practice of seizing foster children’s Social Security benefits to cover the cost of foster care.
Gov. Mike Kehoe on Wednesday signed a bill that would also ban child marriage and stop child sex abusers from using non-disclosure agreements to silence their victims. The bill was sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, and handled by Republican state Sen. Jamie Burger of Benton in the upper chamber.
Missouri’s child welfare agency takes millions of dollars each year in foster children’s benefits and uses the money to help pay for foster care. In fiscal year 2024, the Children’s Division spent more than $10.6 million recovered from children’s benefits. Over 1,200 foster kids were receiving benefits in Missouri of late last year, or just over 10% of all kids in care.
As a result, kids who are orphaned or have disabilities are responsible for paying toward the cost of their care in state custody. 
The bill would ban the state from using those benefits to pay itself back for routine foster care expenses. Instead, the division could use the funds for the child’s “unmet needs” beyond what the division is obligated to pay, such as housing as the child prepares to age out of foster care.
The effort to ban the practice won bipartisan support during the 2024 session and was on the verge of passing. But it died when GOP infighting forced the state Senate to adjourn early. 
The foster benefits ban was the starting point for the bill, with other provisions, including the ban on child marriage added when it reached the state Senate. 
Other provisions include:

Increasing a tax credit for donations to certain youth programs.
Stating that the state Children’s Division cannot hold itself harmless in contracts with private service providers when there are issues resulting from the state’s negligence.
Requiring Children’s Division caseworkers to present identification of themselves when conducting investigations of child abuse and neglect, and inform parents of their rights.
Requiring the Children’s Division to take into consideration the religion of the foster child when determining placement, in order to ensure children are in households of a similar religion to their families’ when practicable.

 Child marriage ban

Under current Missouri law, anyone under 16 is prohibited from getting married. But 16 and 17 year olds can get married with parental consent to anyone under 21. 
Under the new law, which goes into effect Aug. 28, marriage for anyone under age 18 will be illegal. 
The bill garnered bipartisan support, but an outspoken group of Republican lawmakers condemned the child marriage ban — saying they knew couples who were married as teens and are still together and warning that more teens would get abortions if they couldn’t marry.
“There are legitimate reasons for people 16, 17 to become married,” state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack, a Savannah Republican, said during an April House debate. “A pregnancy could be a legitimate reason to become married, for one thing.” 
Last year, the bill stalled due to GOP critics.
In 2023 Republican state Sen. Mike Moon’s opposition to the child marriage ban garnered national attention when he said: “Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12? I do. And guess what? They’re still married.”
The bill also voids nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases and expands access to legal counsel for families in child abuse and neglect cases.

Travis Fitzwater sponsored the provision requiring legal representation for children 14 and older in foster cases (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Older children in foster care would have their own attorneys and a commission will study how to improve legal representation throughout the foster care system under a bill signed Wednesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
The provision Republican state Sen. Travis Fitzwater of Holts Summit added to a sweeping foster care bill makes changes to the model of legal representation for certain foster kids and establishes a commission to look into parental defense.
A similar provision is included in another bill, also signed Wednesday. That bill also extends several tax credits, strengthens the law against hazing on college campuses and adds new protections for young people testifying in criminal cases. 
“Today’s action on this legislation is about standing up for the most vulnerable Missourians; those who often times cannot advocate for themselves,” Kehoe said in a news release. “Protecting these individuals is not just a priority, it’s a responsibility we all share, and we appreciate the General Assembly for sending this legislation to my desk. We must provide safety, support, and dignity to those who need it most.”
A monthslong investigation by the Independent earlier this year found Missouri’s system for providing legal representation to families ensnared in the foster care system is highly decentralized, relying on county-level funding and operating with little state oversight. Some parents go without representation, while those who do get assigned an attorney often find them too overworked and underpaid to provide meaningful advocacy.
The bill would also change the model of legal representation for foster children who are 14 and older, so kids “have somebody going to bat, that are on their side in the court system,” Fitzwater said earlier this year. 
Currently, foster children in Missouri are assigned guardians ad litem, who are attorneys tasked with acting in what they view as the child’s best interest.  The bill would assign children 14 and older to client-directed attorneys, meaning they would act based on the goals of the children. 
The bill also establishes a commission to study parents’ and children’s legal representation throughout the state, and directs the commission to recommend practice standards and training requirements. 
The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to representation for those facing criminal charges. But there is no such federal right in civil court, where foster care cases unfold. The consequences — family separation — can feel as severe as incarceration.
The outcome can depend on where you live, even within the state, The Independent’s investigation found.
In some Missouri counties, more than 80% of foster care cases involving a biological parent list no attorney for the parent, while in other counties, that rate is under 10%. That’s according to data produced by the Office of State Courts Administrator — which provides administrative, business and technology support to Missouri courts — in response to a request from The Independent. 
State law grants judges in Missouri more discretion than in most other states when deciding whether to appoint counsel for indigent parents. Once appointed, quality and pay vary widely. 
A survey of Missouri’s 46 judicial circuits by The Independent shows some counties pay parents’ attorneys as little as $25 per hearing, and some attorneys carry hundreds of cases at a time. Attorneys told The Independent in some counties parent representation is considered pro bono work because the pay is so low. 
There is currently no required specialized training in the state to be a parents’ attorney, though there is required training for similar positions, such as guardians ad litem — attorneys tasked with representing foster kids’ best interests. There are no state Supreme Court-adopted standards of practice. Parents’ attorneys in most counties in the state are solo practitioners who agree to take on some of these cases in addition to the rest of their caseload. They don’t always have expertise in this complex area of law. 
Just one county was in the process of spending federal funding that has been available for parent representation since 2019, as of earlier this year.
The change to legal representation of older foster children, which would be subject to appropriation, goes into effect in 2028 unless a county opts into a pilot program. The judge in each case would still have the discretion to continue the guardian ad litem appointment. 
There are at least 10 states that have adopted client-directed legal representation for all foster children, and 11 other states have adopted it for kids of a certain age, competency or need, according to the National Association of Counsel for Children’s campaign Counsel for Kids.
Some lawmakers raised concerns that children would want to go to unsafe homes, such as returning to parents recently released from prison. The bill was changed to offer the judge discretion as to whether to appoint counsel in addition to a guardian ad litem. 
Additionally, the American Bar Association’s model rules of conduct provide guidance for attorneys in those kinds of situations, and studies have shown the client-directed model for kids to produce better outcomes in terms of time spent in foster care, and chances of reunification. 
It would also require the state Department of Social Services to build a program of residential care for youth with severe behavioral challenges currently being held in inappropriate placements, by contracting with qualified service providers. This, too, would likely require funding by the legislature.

Read this story in English.
El impuesto al diésel en Connecticut es diferente a la mayoría de los demás cargos estatales.
Los legisladores ajustan constantemente las principales fuentes de ingresos del estado (los impuestos sobre la renta, las ventas y las corporaciones), revisando créditos, eliminando o añadiendo exenciones, o revisando las tasas en pocos años.
El impuesto a la gasolina minorista, uno de los principales impulsores del programa de transporte de Connecticut, no es el resultado de ningún cálculo especial, sino de una tarifa fija de 25 centavos por galón.
Sin embargo, el impuesto al diésel ha funcionado en piloto automático durante casi dos décadas, siguiendo una fórmula y actualizándose automáticamente cada 1 de julio. Este año, esa fórmula resultó en una reducción del impuesto de 3.5 centavos por galón, que entró en vigor la semana pasada.
Y dado que la gran mayoría de las mercancías que se entregan a Connecticut se transportan en camiones, que dependen principalmente del diésel, los cambios en dicho impuesto pueden afectar los precios de los comestibles, la ropa, los medicamentos y una amplia variedad de otros artículos. Esto es lo que debe saber sobre el impuesto estatal al diésel y el impacto de la reducción de este año.
¿Cómo se calcula el impuesto al diésel?
Ante la solicitud de la industria camionera y otros sectores de mantener los impuestos al diésel cerca de los gravámenes estatales relacionados con la gasolina regular, la Asamblea General de 2007 promulgó una fórmula de tres pasos.
Primero, los funcionarios estatales analizarían el año anterior y determinarían el precio promedio al por mayor del combustible diésel en Connecticut.
Segundo, multiplicarían ese precio promedio por el 8.81%, que es la tarifa al por mayor efectiva que se aplica a la gasolina cuando se entrega en gasolineras y tiendas minoristas locales.
Tercero, añadirían una cantidad fija de 29 centavos por galón.
La fórmula se aplicaría cada verano y la tasa del impuesto al diésel actualizada entraría en vigor el 1 de julio.
Este sistema no es idéntico, pero es similar al de Connecticut para gravar la gasolina regular. Además del impuesto mayorista que se añade al precio cuando se entrega el combustible en la gasolinera, el estado añade un impuesto minorista — una tarifa fija de 25 centavos por galón — cuando los conductores compran la gasolina.
¿Cómo ha cambiado el impuesto al diésel en los últimos años?
A pesar de estas medidas, el impuesto al diésel no siempre funciona como los legisladores estatales o el gobernador desean, aunque este año sí lo hizo.
El Departamento de Servicios de Impuestos anunció recientemente que, a partir del 1 de julio, la fórmula redujo el impuesto en 3.5 centavos por galón, de 52.4 centavos a 48.9 centavos.
“Esta reducción de impuestos llega en un momento crítico, cuando la economía se enfrenta a una gran incertidumbre debido al conflicto en Oriente Medio, que podría afectar los precios del petróleo, y a las intermitentes guerras comerciales de la administración [federal]”, declaró la Senadora Christine Cohen, Demócrata por Guilford, copresidenta del Comité de Transporte de la legislatura. “Esta disminución proporcionará cierto alivio en los costos operativos para las empresas, en particular para la industria del transporte por carretera, y espero que este alivio se comparta con los consumidores”.
Alrededor del 90% de la carga, tanto en tonelaje como en valor en dólares, transportada por Connecticut en 2019 se realizó en camión, según la actualización de 2022 del Plan Estatal de Carga del Departamento de Transporte. El resto se transportó principalmente por ferrocarril.
Sin embargo, tres senadores estatales Republicanos instaron recientemente a los consumidores a recordar su historia.
Desde julio de 2021, cuando la fórmula resultó en un impuesto de 40.1 centavos por galón, el impuesto, en general, ha aumentado 8.8 centavos.
Los Republicanos minoritarios propusieron suspender por completo el impuesto al diésel en el verano de 2022, cuando el aumento de los precios del combustible provocó un aumento de 9 centavos por galón en el impuesto, incluso cuando la inflación afectó significativamente los bolsillos de los consumidores. El Índice de Precios al Consumidor aumentó un 9.1 % en junio de 2022, según la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales de EE. UU., el mayor aumento en 40 años.
Y el impuesto al diésel habría aumentado otros 12 centavos por galón en julio de 2023, pero el gobernador Ned Lamont y la legislatura ordenaron una suspensión única de la fórmula.
¿Se acepta la fórmula o se ha solicitado su modificación?
El Partido Republicano ha abogado por una reducción del impuesto al diésel y por la eliminación del impuesto al kilometraje en carretera para los camiones comerciales grandes, no lácteos.
“Eso apoyaría a las empresas locales, crearía empleos y brindaría un alivio real a todos en Connecticut”, escribieron el líder de la minoría del Senado, Stephen Harding, de Brookfield, y los Senadores Republicanos Jeff Gordon, de Woodstock, y Henri Martin, de Bristol, en una declaración conjunta a finales de junio.
El impuesto al diésel financia aproximadamente el 6% del Fondo Especial de Transporte (STF) del presupuesto estatal, que obtiene la mayor parte de sus recursos del impuesto sobre las ventas de Connecticut y de los gravámenes sobre la gasolina regular. 
Generó $134 millones en el año fiscal 2023-24, el último año completo con datos disponibles de las autoridades fiscales estatales. Connecticut ha generado grandes superávits del Fondo Especial de Transporte en los últimos años, algunos superiores al 10%, aunque los legisladores y Lamont se han comprometido a utilizar gran parte de estos ingresos extraordinarios para acelerar el pago de la deuda vinculada a bonos en proyectos de construcción de carreteras, puentes y ferrocarriles.
La Asociación de Comerciantes de Energía de Connecticut (CEMA), que representa a los distribuidores de combustible de todo el estado, ha presionado en los últimos años para que el estado sustituya el impuesto al diésel basado en fórmulas por un cargo fijo por galón.
“La estabilidad del impuesto es lo más sensato”, declaró Chris Herb, presidente y director ejecutivo de CEMA. “Si los impuestos no fluctúan, se facilita la venta del combustible”.

CHAPEL HILL—Perched above the Bolin Creek Trail, 46,000 tons of coal ash appeared to be intact Monday afternoon, the mound’s slopes anchored by bushes and vines.
But at the foot of the ash pile outside its fence, the force of the floodwaters from Tropical Depression Chantal had evicted large trees from the banks of the nearby creek. Rocks larger than bowling balls had caromed off one another. A dead crawdad lay on the trail, washed out from the creek. The air smelled vaguely of sewage.
Early Sunday morning, Tropical Storm Chantal had blown ashore in South Carolina, and by the time it meandered into central North Carolina, it had weakened to a tropical depression.
But by nightfall the impacts felt akin to a hurricane: 5 to 10 inches of rain fell within 12 hours.

Dams burst. Interstates closed. Roads washed away. The Haw River reached historic levels, rising as much as 22 feet in four hours, engulfing parts of Saxapahaw. Hillsborough officials advised residents to boil their water after parts of the treatment plant flooded. More than 17,000 Duke Energy customers lost power.
Eighty people who live along the Eno River in Durham had to be rescued, and another 63 were displaced in Chapel Hill. First responders had to conduct 13 water rescues near Southern Pines. One elderly woman in Chatham County died when her car became trapped in floodwaters.
Storms like Chantal—and Hurricane Helene, which technically had been downgraded to a tropical storm when it devastated western North Carolina last September—are at least in part attributable to a warming world, according to climate scientists.
Warmer air holds more moisture. The 2020 North Carolina Climate Science Report cited a study whose modeling showed an increase in the number of intense hourly rainfall events. North Carolina-based experts concluded that it’s likely severe thunderstorms in central North Carolina will happen more often.
Durham is already experiencing more extreme storms and precipitation events, according to the county’s 2023 Community Health Assessment, including a 129 percent increase in heavy precipitation events from 2005 to 2014 compared to the 1950s.
Yet a majority of North Carolina’s state lawmakers seem to ignore the scientific evidence. Two weeks before the storm, the state Senate had joined the House in passing Senate Bill 266, titled “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” that, in addition to providing utilities with financial incentives for natural gas and nuclear energy, would allow Duke Energy to cancel its interim carbon reduction goal of 70 percent by 2030. The utility would still have to achieve net zero by 2050.
Rep. Dean Arp, a Republican from Union County, co-sponsored the bill, with outspoken support from utilities, the American Petroleum Institute, the N.C. Chamber and manufacturing interests. Arp called it a “responsible, prudent bill.”
“People ask, ‘Why not just delay those interim goals instead of repealing them?’” Arp said on the House floor.
For bill opponents, planning is the point, a critical step to reaching net zero. “Our planet’s on fire: hurricanes, storms, wildfires, deadly heat, droughts, crazy weather,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Democrat from Guilford County.
By eliminating the interim goal, it will be more difficult to achieve net zero by 2050, she said.
Senate Bill 266, coupled with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed rollbacks of greenhouse gas rules, will give North Carolina utilities carte blanche to pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane into the air. The power plants’ emissions will accelerate the pace of climate change with near certainty.
“Science is unforgiving,” said Rep. Abe Jones, a Wake County Democrat. “This bill isn’t smart or realistic. Nature will have its way.”
Helene’s survivors and climate trauma
Nine months ago, Colleen Daly eyed the floodwaters that surrounded her apartment complex south of Asheville.
The day before, Hurricane Helene had made landfall in Florida. Then, on Sept. 27, 2024, the storm surged up the spine of the Appalachians and flattened swaths of western North Carolina.
Yet even as the floodwaters rose, Daly believed the storm’s ferocity would soon pass.
We’ll be on this island, she thought, but we’re going to be OK.

Daly soon met a woman who had sought refuge in the apartment building. The electricity was out. No one had cell phone service or running water.
“‘I came here thinking there would be power,’” Daly said the woman told her. “‘I came here thinking that I could use my machine, that there might be extra oxygen. I don’t have any oxygen left.’”
Daly said her husband and a neighbor swam a quarter of a mile to the Fletcher fire station, where they got an oxygen tank. They swam back, she said, holding it over their heads as the water continued to pour in.
Daly told her story one evening in mid-June at a People’s Hearing, held in Asheville at the Highland Brewery Event Center, an airy, vaulted room illuminated by sunbeams bending through wide windows and overhead strings of retro Edison bulbs.
Against a backdrop of purple, red and white signs that read “People Over Polluters” and “Stop EPA’s Climate Chaos,” two dozen hurricane survivors, local officials and environmental advocates gathered on stage to testify about the trauma they experienced during Helene and the historic storm’s connection to climate change.

Event organizers recorded the testimony to send it to the EPA. Earlier this year, on what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described as “a historic day at the EPA,” he formally proposed two regulatory repeals for power plants, Inside Climate News reported at the time: the end of greenhouse gas rules and mercury and air toxics regulations.
The economic benefits to the fossil fuel industry would total $20 billion over the next two decades, Zeldin said.
Yet that figure is dwarfed by the estimated costs of Helene’s destruction in western North Carolina alone, according to state officials—$60 billion—and the years of recovery that lie ahead.
“The testifiers are here to demonstrate that they are proof that climate change is a real threat,” said Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, “and we need more protections from climate pollution, not less.”
How to comment on the EPA’s proposal
The EPA held a virtual public hearing on its greenhouse gas proposal Tuesday, that can be viewed on YouTube.
The agency is accepting written public comments through Aug. 7. Read the full text of the rule and instructions on how to comment.

In North Carolina, eliminating the interim carbon reduction goal would save ratepayers $13 billion, bill supporters said. Senate Bill 266 would also permit Duke Energy to pass the financing costs of new natural gas and nuclear plants to its customers, with permission from the N.C. Utilities Commission. This would save $1.5 billion in future interest, bill sponsors said.
An analysis written by three N.C. State University environmental engineering professors contradicts that figure. They estimated removing the interim target would not reduce power bills, but instead could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion in added fuel expenses over the same time.
Companies would increase natural gas generation by nearly 40 percent between 2030 and 2050, the analysis suggested, and those fuel costs are expected to rise.
Demand for gas turbines has increased their cost by twofold, according to S&P Global, and wait times can range from one to seven years.
“I can’t overstate how removing our carbon goal is not a good idea,” said Harrison, the representative from Guilford County. “This bill promotes natural gas and nuclear at the expense of cleaner energy sources. It’s not balancing environmental goals.”
Bill supporters are justifying a massive fossil fuel infrastructure buildout happening in North Carolina to meet the energy demands from massive server farms called data centers needed to power energy-hungry AI applications and crypto mines.
Zeldin, the EPA administrator, has also cited data centers to justify the need for fossil fuels. “Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world,” Zeldin said in a press statement.
Data centers often operate in secrecy, making it difficult to know where they plan to locate and to ascertain the amount of energy they use.
Microsoft required Person County officials to sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of the county’s sale of a 1,350-acre megasite to the tech company. The land is adjacent to where Duke Energy plans to build two new natural gas plants and Enbridge intends to construct a new eight-mile segment of natural gas pipeline.
Neither Microsoft nor the county has announced what will be built on the tract, but a legislative presentation by the American Petroleum Institute earlier this year listed it as a data center.
The costs people bear
An hour before the People’s Hearing, it began to rain. So intense was the deluge that a car’s windshield wipers could not keep pace with the torrents. From Black Mountain through Swannanoa into East Asheville, mud pooled around mounds of debris that over the past six months had been extracted from the riverbed.
Near the North Carolina-Tennessee border, flash flooding triggered a new landslide that closed a segment of Interstate 40, which had only recently re-opened after Helene.
Suddenly the skies cleared. The sunlight took on an amber hue. Thunderheads the color of a deep bruise marched east.
As a baby, Brian Campbell was baptized along Black Creek at the headwaters of the Swannanoa River. Years later, he married his wife there.
“This valley has always been a place that’s felt safest and most like home,” Campbell said at the People’s Hearing.
Campbell is the executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility. Last September he had just returned to North Carolina from several meetings with global experts on climate change and health.
Shortly before midnight, he awoke to heavy rain and wind and, he said, “to the low hum of the Swannanoa River, which I’d never heard before. This normally quiet stream was now churning.”
His family and several neighbors walked down a hill. They stood in silence and watched as whitewater crews rescued unhoused people from a rooftop alongside the MANNA FoodBank, which was engulfed in water, Campbell said.
“We know climate change has real and devastating consequences, and we know the only way to solve this is through strong local, state and federal leadership,” Campbell said. “The EPA must do its part regulating carbon and other harmful emissions. And we must protect federal investments in clean energy, in health care and health research and environmental justice and in community recovery and resilience. These policies and investments save lives, and we refuse to sit quietly while they’re under attack.”
Senate Bill 266 is not yet law. On July 2, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed it.
“This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive but it shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people,” Stein wrote in his veto message. “This bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be part of our clean economy.”
A few Democrats joined Republican lawmakers in supporting the bill. If that margin holds, there will be enough votes for an override.
On Monday, the day after Tropical Depression Chantal reminded far too many North Carolinians of previous hurricanes, workmen with chainsaws sliced up trees that had fallen across highways, business owners mucked out storefronts and tow trucks hauled away soaked cars. Over 15,000 people were still without power as temperatures soared into the 90s.

(File/Getty Images)One person in the Upstate tested positive for measles, marking the first South Carolina case for 2025, the state Department of Public Health said Wednesday.
The case comes amid a national outbreak of the disease, with more cases nationwide in the first half of 2025 than have been reported since 1992, eight years before measles was considered eliminated. Three people have died from measles in the country this year — two in Texas and one in New Mexico — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The South Carolina resident, who was unvaccinated and had not previously had measles, was exposed during an international trip and is isolating at home to prevent spreading the virus, according to the public health agency.
The department has notified people who were potentially exposed, and public health officials “have no reason to believe at this time that this case will spark an outbreak in our state,” said Brannon Traxler, the department’s chief medical officer.
The department declined to provide other information, including the person’s age and county of residence, because of privacy concerns.
Another person in the state, also from the Upstate, was confirmed to have measles in September 2024 following another international trip. The state had six cases reported in 2018, with no other cases since 1997, Traxler said.
The disease is highly infectious and can be fatal, especially in children, Traxler said.
Symptoms often begin with a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually lasts five or six days. In severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, according to the health department.
Vaccination against measles is highly effective, according to the public health department.
Children typically receive two doses of the measles vaccine, the first between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second between 4 and 6 years.
The rate of vaccination for school-age children in South Carolina has decreased slightly in recent years, falling from about 96% during the 2020-2021 school year to just under 94% in 2024-2025, according to the health department.
As for the measles vaccine specifically, 92% of kindergarteners during the 2023-24 school year had received at least one dose, according to the most recent data available. That’s on par with the national average of kindergarteners who received the vaccine that year, according to the CDC.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

Tuesday’s outcome places Marblehead among the 38 communities that have not yet achieved compliance with state law, risking loss of eligibility for competitive state grant programs potentially worth over $10 million.
The post Marblehead voters overturn multifamily housing zoning appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MARBLEHEAD’S VOTERS Tuesday overturned state-mandated multifamily housing overlay districts approved at May’s Town Meeting, with 6,939 of 16,732 registered voters turning out to reject the measure 3,642 to 3,297  (52.5 percent to 47.5 percent), surpassing the 3,347 votes needed for repeal and winning by a margin of 345 votes.

The result nullifies zoning changes Town Meeting approved 951-759 on May 6, placing Marblehead in non-compliance with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Communities Act after a July 14 state deadline. The referendum marked the first successful use of Marblehead’s 1954 Special Act allowing citizen petitions to challenge select Town Meeting decisions.
“The voters have spoken and as a Select Board we will have to figure out how to move forward under the state’s constraints of being non-compliant with 3A,” Select Board chair Dan Fox told the Current shortly after the results were tallied.
Marblehead Housing Coalition chair Peirce Law told the Current, “This is not the outcome we were hoping for today, but our work is not finished. Long-term noncompliance is not an option, and we fear for the repercussions that Marblehead may soon face. The Marblehead Housing Coalition will continue to pursue better housing options for the people that make us this great community.”
Attorneys Yael Magen and John DiPiano successfully petitioned for the special election after Town Meeting’s approval.

Yael Magen and Tim Swigor embrace inside Abbot Hall on July 8 after learning that voters had overturned Marblehead’s multifamily zoning overlay districts.
“My goal was to get it on the ballot, provide information and let the democratic process play out,” DiPiano said. “That has now happened, and Marblehead will have to find its way through the next step in this journey.”
Magen added, “Today, the residents spoke. It is time for the Select Board to listen and act in the benefit of the residents.”
Tim Swigor made opposition to 3A a cornerstone of his unsuccessful Planning Board campaign in June. Tuesday night, he said, “The consensus in Marblehead has always been clear; residents don’t like being told what to do.”
Tuesday’s vote came despite legal challenges to the MBTA Communities Act itself failing in state courts. Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea dismissed a lawsuit by nine municipalities in June arguing the law constituted an “unfunded mandate,” and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the act’s constitutionality in January.
The MBTA Communities Act, signed into law in January 2021 with broad bipartisan support, requires 177 cities and towns served by or adjacent to MBTA transit to create zoning districts where multifamily housing can be built “as of right” without special permits. The law aims to address the state’s acute housing shortage by encouraging denser development in locations already served by public transportation infrastructure. As a community adjacent to municipalities with commuter rail stations, Marblehead falls under this state mandate.
The Healey-Driscoll Administration told the Current on Tuesday that 139 of 177 MBTA communities — 79 percent — have now approved as-of-right multifamily zoning, many for the first time in decades. The law has already generated nearly 4,200 units in the development pipeline across newly created multifamily districts statewide. In March, the administration awarded $8.7 million in MBTA Community Catalyst Funds to unlock up to 2,332 new units across participating communities.

Supporters of Article 23 wave to drivers on July 8, urging voters to approve the MBTA Communities Act zoning measure.
Article 23 would have created overlay districts spanning approximately 58 acres across three specific areas: Pleasant Street near the town center, an eight-acre section along Broughton Road that includes Marblehead Housing Authority properties, and a 29-acre area on Tioga Way with capacity for up to 483 units including existing developments and underutilized office buildings. The zones would have permitted housing at 15 units per acre and accommodated up to 897 units, though officials noted approximately 360 multifamily housing units already exist within the proposed districts.
Tuesday’s outcome places Marblehead among the 38 communities that have not yet achieved compliance with state law, risking loss of eligibility for competitive state grant programs potentially worth over $10 million through fiscal year 2026 for projects including the Village Street Bridge replacement and coastal resiliency work. While the Healey-Driscoll Administration has provided over $7.8 million in technical assistance and grants to 157 MBTA communities, non-compliance may trigger legal action from the Attorney General’s Office or court-appointed intervention imposing zoning changes without local input.

Residents and community members gather inside Abbot Hall on July 8 to check live updates as Marblehead’s special election results come in.
Magen indicated she would petition the Select Board to file an exemption and negotiate with the state for reduced housing unit requirements, citing Marblehead’s unique landscape constraints and high existing density compared to similar communities.
Town Administrator Thatcher Kezer described early voting turnout as “steady.” The special election cost approximately $12,000, funded from the town’s reserve account.
The repeal follows a similar pattern to Milton, where residents overturned their Town Meeting’s multifamily zoning approval in February 2024 by 54 percent to 46 percent. Milton immediately fell out of compliance with state law, losing eligibility for multiple grant programs before Attorney General Andrea Campbell filed a lawsuit that ultimately reached the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas brought in more than $10 billion in tax revenue in the most recent fiscal year, which is about the same as the previous year’s totals but better than state analysts predicted.
Tax revenues in fiscal year 2025 were about $249 million, or 2.5%, above what state analysts predicted when they revised their forecast in April. In weighing all of the state general fund’s revenues, expenditures and transfers from the past year, total receipts to the state general fund were about $10.02 billion, exceeding estimates by about $132 million, or 1.3%, but dwarfing the previous year’s total by about 1.2%.
Around $124 million was transferred out of the general fund into the state’s rainy day fund, a move that is required under law but was an unexpected transfer to state analysts.
The receipts were a glimpse at the end of the first full year of tax cuts passed during a special session last year, which promised $1.2 billion in tax relief over three years. The 2025 Legislature similarly passed tax relief measures that promised to lower individual and corporate income taxes, but only if the state exceeds revenue estimates and maintains its rainy day fund. The Legislature also passed legislation that will modestly reduce property taxes by eliminating statewide tax levies. Those recent cuts have yet to go into effect.
Gov. Laura Kelly attempted to veto the income tax cut legislation in April, but both chambers overrode the veto almost along party lines.
Kelly warned at the time of a serious “financial predicament ahead,” referring to “bizarre and irresponsible budget gimmicks” from the Republican-led Legislature. When combining the Legislature’s 2025 spending plan with income tax cuts and 2024 relief efforts, the state is expected to be $461 million in the red by fiscal year 2028.
“Ultimately, this will lead to a historically large budget deficit, rivaling the worst of the Brownback years,” she said in an April 18 statement following the release of updated revenue estimates.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican running for state insurance commissioner in 2026, pushed back against Kelly’s warnings.
“Governor Kelly’s repeated vetoes of tax cuts and her sky-is-falling rhetoric look especially foolish now,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Hawkins credited the Republican supermajorities in both chambers with saving Kansas taxpayer dollars and energizing the economy.
“Moving forward, we will continue with the budgeting reforms we implemented this year to reduce wasteful spending and ensure a strong financial future for our state,” he said.
At the time Republicans passed tax cuts and the budget, Democrats criticized them for failing to deliver on meaningful property tax relief, a major campaign topic for 2024 candidates of both parties.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1232633-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

Bernie Sanders, ranking member on the panel, opposed Monarez’s advancement along with the other Democrats on the committee.Sanders argued that during Monarez’s time as acting director of the CDC, she didn’t do enough to counter Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., especially on the safety of vaccines. “Today, the United States is reporting the highest number of measles cases in 33 years,” Sanders said. “In my view, we need a CDC director who will defend science, protect public health and repudiate Secretary Kennedy's dangerous conspiracy theories about safe and effective vaccines that have saved, over the years, millions of lives.”Second CDC choice from TrumpMonarez testified before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in June, a standard part of the confirmation process.Trump originally selected former Florida U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon to run the Atlanta-based CDC shortly after he secured election to the Oval Office in November. But the White House pulled Weldon’s nomination in March, after it appeared he couldn’t secure the votes needed for confirmation.Later that month, Trump announced his plans to nominate Monarez in a social media post.“Dr. Monarez brings decades of experience championing Innovation, Transparency, and strong Public Health Systems,” Trump wrote. “She has a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, and PostDoctoral training in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine.“As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement. Dr. Monarez will work closely with our GREAT Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr. Together, they will prioritize Accountability, High Standards, and Disease Prevention to finally address the Chronic Disease Epidemic and, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN!”",,,,2025-07-09 13:25:28.247783

(Photo courtesy of Gov. Kim Reynolds' office)A federal bill introduced Wednesday by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst would strengthen the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s role in a program that restores vegetation and wetland structure, in an effort to mitigate flooding and improve water quality. 
Known as the “Restoring America’s Floodplains Act,” the bill would simplify language pertaining to the Emergency Watershed Protection program and “make clear” the USDA can provide technical and financial assistance to landowners when land is damaged or threatened by flooding. 
The Emergency Watershed Protection program allows landowners to enter into an easement agreement with USDA to help restore portions of land damaged by flooding, or other circumstances. The program was authorized by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, and amended in a 1996 law. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The program gives USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, the ability to enter easement agreements with landowners so it has the “full authority” to restore a damaged floodplain area with actions to correct drainage, establish vegetative covers or reinstate the hydraulic capacity of wetland structure. 
According to a 2022 USDA report on the Emergency Watershed Protection program,  NRCS has purchased permanent floodplain easements on 184,254 acres, across 36 states, including Ernst’s home state of Iowa. 
The bill simplifies some of the language pertaining to the program and gives the Secretary of Agriculture the “sole discretion” to enter  compatible-use agreements with landowners and other organizations on easements acquired under the program.
Flooding frequently impacts cropland and communities in Iowa. Ernst, as a former member of the Iowa Army National Guard, recalled serving during the historic 2008 flood that impacted eastern portions of the state. 
“I’ve seen firsthand the devastating impacts flooding can have on our communities in Iowa, and my heart goes out to all those who have been impacted by destructive natural disasters,” Ernst said in a statement. “I’m proud to be working on a bipartisan solution to proactively reduce these impacts, that will use existing tools at no additional cost to taxpayers while also improving water quality and protecting our valuable land.”
The legislation is also sponsored by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. and is supported by several Iowa conservation programs in Iowa. 
Amber Markham, the director of external affairs for The Nature Conservancy in Iowa, said nature is the best solution to control flooding. 
“Nature-based solutions like floodplain restorations provide countless benefits to Iowans and we support legislation that advances these goals,” Markham said in a statement. 
Chris Fox, the policy chair for Iowa Ducks Unlimited, said floodplain easements are a “perfect example” of natural, incentive-based tools that “benefit people, our communities, and wildlife.” 
The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation also supported the bill, with the organization’s public policy director and council, Anna Gray, saying it will provide producers with “critical relief” while facing flooding disasters and have “cascading benefits” for Iowa.

Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, is running for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by Republican Andy Barr. (LRC Public Information) State Rep. Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, is running for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by Republican Andy Barr.
On her campaign website, Gordon touts her support of President Donald Trump on a variety of issues, including immigration, guns and energy. 
Gordon is the fourth candidate to enter the closely-watched race in Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. The seat became open when Barr decided to run for U.S. Senate to succeed Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell who is not seeking reelection.
Other candidates for the U.S. House seat are Democrats David Kloiber and former state Rep. Cherlynn Stevenson, both of Lexington, and Republican state Rep. Ryan Dotson, of Winchester.
Dr. Ralph Alvarado, the 2019 running mate of former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, announced in a social media post this week that he is considering a run after Republican state Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, of Lexington, said she will not be seeking the seat. Alvarado served in the Kentucky Senate, representing Clark and parts of Fayette and Montgomery counties.
Gordon has served in the Kentucky House since 2019. 
“Central Kentucky isn’t looking for a puppet or the next in line – they want someone who understands real-world problems and fixes them, not kicks the can down the road while being more concerned about the consequences of the next election,” Gordon’s campaign site says.

(Photo by Oleg Albinsky/Getty images)The fate of short-term rentals on the small, wealthy island of Nantucket is, for now, treading water.
For an island that booms from around 14,000 to over 80,000 residents between the off-season and the so-called “high season,” vacation rentals are an existential issue. Though the rentals are essential to the regional economy, their length and location are also deeply polarizing, setting up clashes between local voters, zoning officials, and the courts that offer a warning to communities grappling with similar debates around the region.
Nantucket, like its Cape and Islands neighbors, sits at the intersection of a few characteristics. It’s an historic region with strict rules around what can be built and where. It’s a summer retreat that attracts beachgoers from around the country. And it’s what’s known in Massachusetts as a “seasonal community,” with about 60% of its units in seasonal, recreational, or part-time use.
This sets up a constant clash between those who benefit and profit from the surging rental and vacation home industry and those who argue that year-round residents are being asked to shoulder a boom they didn’t sign up for.
The town is appealing a June ruling from the Massachusetts Land Court that the Nantucket Zoning Board was incorrect when it determined that a property in downtown Nantucket was allowed as a short-term vacation rental under the town’s zoning code. It is the latest turn in a years-long dispute over the rental property, where one neighbor sued another for operating short-term rentals, during which Town Meeting voters have thrown up their hands at several warrant articles over the past years that would clarify the island’s zoning law on short-term rentals.
This spring, Town Meeting voters on the island rejected four different articles related to vacation rentals. Though a majority of voters signed on to one of the articles – a citizen’s petition article that would allow short-term rentals in all residential zoning districts, it did not reach the two-thirds threshold needed to become local zoning law.
Other articles that would restrict the use of properties as short term rentals, require the owners to occupy the parcels for a certain portion of the year, collect data on and restrict the number of short-term rentals, also missed the threshold.
“Tonight brings us to another showdown between two very different visions of a small island facing a very challenging future,” said island resident Charity Benz at the Town Meeting, in which only registered Nantucket voters may vote. Those who supported the citizen’s petition “are obsessed with monetizing Nantucket,” Benz said. “However, those who have seen the impact of the transaction economy on Nantucket over the years have a very different perspective. Too much more of everything is simply unsustainable for the island itself and for the taxpayers who are being asked to subsidize its further exploitation.”
The transaction economy Benz referenced is a cycle in which lots are purchased, homes enlarged or built, and those houses then sold off or kept for part-time or rental use. Bigger and bigger homes require more and more of a draw on resources, while public employees find it harder to stay on the island where they work.
As voters shrugged off attempts to codify short-term rental policy over the years, the matter has swirled through the state land court.
In the series of lawsuits brought by a resident challenging a neighboring property’s right to operate as a short-term rental and the town’s decision to allow it, judge Michael Vhay has consistently decreed that short-term rentals of “primary dwellings” are not explicitly allowed under Nantucket’s zoning bylaw unless they are “accessory” uses.
In this specific case, he ruled, the use is not allowed even though town government has long behaved as though short-term rentals are acceptable, and he directed the town to enforce the bylaw as he interpreted it.
The town has filed a motion to stay part of Vhay’s June 6 judgment pending appeal, arguing that this would be extremely disruptive and unusual, because the town has never wielded zoning power against a short-tern rental before and officials believe the use is allowed under local law.
As Town Meeting warrant efforts stutter and the court case plods along, the island is set to find a few new housing arrows in its quiver this fall.
State-designated seasonal communities like Nantucket will have access, under last year’s sweeping housing bond bill, to a set of tools including year-round housing occupancy restrictions, artist and public employee housing, and allowing tiny homes to be built by-right and used as year-round housing.
A dedicated Seasonal Communities Advisory Council, made up of representatives and stakeholders from vacation-home-rich communities around the state, announced in May recommendations for the state housing office to refine the toolkit. The next virtual engagement session on the regulations is scheduled for Wednesday, July 9.
Among the recommendations are how best to consider the amount of part-time and vacation units, as well as the income disparities between area income and area home sale price. Other recommendations are aimed at easing a core part of the seasonal communities requirements: allowing construction on smaller lots than typically allowed by current zoning.
These new seasonal communities requirements won’t be washing up on Cape and Islands shores this season – final regulations are expected to be finalized around September – but the task force is recommending a “use it or lose it” approach to the new tools. If communities don’t implement new requirements like adopting bylaws to allow for undersized lot construction within two years, they say, the state should withdraw its toolkit.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Nearly three weeks after Broadacres Market abruptly shut down, it’s unclear how long the closure will last, leaving hundreds of vendors without a source of income and desperate for answers.
Word of mouth brought several vendors to the Centroid Christiana El Shaddai, a church in North Las Vegas, where a private community discussion led by Congressman Steven Horsford Tuesday was scheduled for a select few.
The Tuesday event was promptly moved to another location after increased public interest attracted media and more vendors than anticipated to the church. The move left several vendors who expected to hear from lawmakers without a clear explanation about the change in venue.
“The meeting was always intended to be an intimate conversation to allow participants to speak freely about their concerns,” said a spokesperson from Horsford’s office.
“The event drew significant public interest – more than anticipated. Out of concerns for safety, and to ensure an honest conversation, Rep. Horsford’s office moved the meeting to a setting that allowed for the intimate conversation to proceed as planned,” the spokesperson continued.
Horsford’s office said they are now organizing “a public-facing community-wide event” to address the closure and work towards a solution after Tuesday’s event drew strong interest. 
But the sudden venue change and the ongoing closure have left many vendors without answers or support.
Vendors like Maria Flores, who sells religious items at the open-air market, said she feels abandoned by Broadacres management and lawmakers after a lack of clear communication.
”I feel a little frustrated because I don’t see anyone with answers coming out,” said Flores in her native Spanish. “Today was canceled, and we don’t know why it was canceled.”
Flores said when she heard about Tuesday’s community discussion she was hopeful the event would provide more information on the closure of Broadacres, including when vendors could expect to return. Without a clear return date, she’ll be forced to look for other work in order to cover her expenses.
”There’s a lot of us vendors, and we’re all distressed,” she said. 
Flores, who has been selling goods at Broadacres for about 20 years, said management and local lawmakers could do more to support vendors impacted by the market’s closure. 
Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada, attracting more than 15,000 people every weekend. It houses a variety of vendors, particularly those catering to the Latino population. 
The collective number of people working as and for vendors also effectively makes Broadacres one of the largest employers in the City of North Las Vegas, according to data from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training & Rehabilitation.
The open-air market has been closed since June 21, when the market told vendors by managers to close their shops until further notice due to concerns over potential immigration raids. The closure left hundreds of vendors and employees with a significant loss of income, and no set date for a return.
The market said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution and concern” for its vendors, customers, and staff.
“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business or for us to be a beacon of shopping and entertainment while our federal government is raiding businesses and detaining its people,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BAM-1-1024x686.png,,,2025-07-09 11:07:18.090855

The Supreme Court said Tuesday those cuts could proceed, for now. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay










For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
Another federal judge orders AmeriCorps to reinstate workers, restore funds

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

One less-known, missing part of many of these communities is legal representation, Peters said, which leaves people without recourse to handle problems of that nature or even the knowledge of when a lawyer is needed.
Peters, joined by two ISU students and future lawyers, conducted a study into lawyer shortages across the U.S. to identify where there is most need and go over practiced and possible solutions to ensure even those living in remote areas have access to the legal help they need.
“Not having enough lawyers puts rural people at a disadvantage because the legal system only really works if you have a lawyer that can either assert your rights or (provide) a mechanism to seek redress,” Peters said.
Emma Bartling graduated from ISU in the spring with a degree in agricultural and rural policy studies, and has enrolled in the University of South Dakota for law school with hopes of returning her home turf in Hardin County to practice. Emily Meyer still has one year of school left before graduation, but Bartling said both of them hope to return to rural areas to practice when they’re ready.

With this in mind, Bartling said she and Meyer got involved in the study to further their understanding of what they were getting into and why others weren’t following their path.
“To us, it was just an opportunity to better our learning and to kind of open a door that we would be going into, but just a little bit sooner,” Bartling said.
Peters was researching population decline in small towns when he came across the lack of private-practice attorneys, even in county seats where many residents go for their health care needs and other services they can’t find in their area.
Rather than just looking at the total population of counties and comparing it to the number of lawyers practicing there, Peters said they used 2022 Census data to find out how many private-practice attorneys are located in each county and held it up to estimated demand for their services. These numbers helped determine if a legal desert exists in a given county and how severe it is.
Looking at more than 2,300 counties across the U.S., the study found that 11% of rural counties are critical legal deserts, with the largest gap between lawyer supply and demand for their services.
One example Peters gave was of Lee County — Iowa’s only county listed as a critical legal desert — where he said around 30 lawyers are practicing. Based on the county’s town populations, employers and other factors, the researchers found the county should have closer to 55 lawyers. Lee County is a “micropolitan county,” Peters said, as it has at least one town of between 10,000 and 50,000 people.
The majority of Iowa counties in the study were classified as having average levels of lawyers or higher, according to the study, with 10 counties identified as having emerging legal deserts. Most of these cases are in southern Iowa, Peters said, where farmland is less expensive and areas are more impoverished.

Bartling said that many counties with legal deserts are clustered together, so those looking for a lawyer might need to travel even farther. This could be especially scary and difficult to deal with for those experiencing domestic violence and the like.
“If those micropolitans, even, don’t have enough lawyers, then that just puts rural counties adjacent to that micropolitan (at an) even bigger disadvantage,” Peters said.
It surprised Peters to learn this, he said, and another shock came when the team learned pay for lawyers in rural areas was fairly similar no matter whether they were practicing in a legal desert or not, and the real pay gap is between urban and rural practices. This shows that using financial incentives to move lawyers into rural markets wouldn’t be very effective, he said.
Bartling and Meyer also looked into existing policy to try and solve this problem and identified their own solution.
 Finding solutions to fill the gap

Legal work is not the first thing people think of when they think of industry workforce shortages, Peters said, and in reality it is quite different from what is being experienced in the fields of health care and manufacturing, among others. There are surpluses of lawyers in some urban areas, and there is no federal push to address the issue.
South Dakota has seen success from a rural attorney recruitment program, Bartling said, which lets law students practice in rural counties before they have completed their schooling. The program has seen success, she said, but it won’t fit in every situation, just like other initiatives the team reviewed, like mobile legal clinics and external fellowship programs.
One program they identified as viable is a licensed legal paraprofessional program, Bartling said, where the state would allow those with legal training but not a full degree to practice independently in certain areas, like family law.
It would allow people from rural communities who have some legal training but another profession to fill a need without having to leave for years to get the highest licensure, and still be able to complete their other work when legal help isn’t needed, Peters said.
“I think it’s definitely up to states discretion how they want to implement it, but we saw that that would probably have the most impact, direct impact to the rural community members,” Bartling said.

The wealthy enclave of Nantucket is, like its neighbors on the Cape, trying to chart a path forward as a community torn between the rental economy and a housing crunch. 
The post A stormy season for short-term rentals on Nantucket appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE FATE short-term rentals on the small, wealthy island of Nantucket is, for now, treading water. 
For an island that booms from around 14,000 to over 80,000 residents between the off-season and the so-called “high season,” vacation rentals are an existential issue. Though the rentals are essential to the regional economy, their length and location are also deeply polarizing, setting up clashes between local voters, zoning officials, and the courts that offer a warning to communities grappling with similar debates around the region. 
Nantucket, like its Cape and Islands neighbors, sits at the intersection of a few characteristics. It’s an historic region with strict rules around what can be built and where. It’s a summer retreat that attracts beachgoers from around the country. And it’s what’s known in Massachusetts as a “seasonal community,” with about 60 percent of its units in seasonal, recreational, or part-time use.  
This sets up a constant clash between those who benefit and profit from the surging rental and vacation home industry and those who argue that year-round residents are being asked to shoulder a boom they didn’t sign up for. 
The town is appealing a June ruling from the Massachusetts Land Court that the Nantucket Zoning Board was incorrect when it determined that a property in downtown Nantucket was allowed as a short-term vacation rental under the town’s zoning code. It is the latest turn in a years-long dispute over the rental property, where one neighbor sued another for operating short-term rentals, during which Town Meeting voters have thrown up their hands at several warrant articles over the past years that would clarify the island’s zoning law on short-term rentals.
This spring, Town Meeting voters on the island rejected four different articles related to vacation rentals. Though a majority of voters signed on to one of the articles – a citizen’s petition article that would allow short-term rentals in all residential zoning districts, it did not reach the two-thirds threshold needed to become local zoning law. 
Other articles that would restrict the use of properties as short term rentals, require the owners to occupy the parcels for a certain portion of the year, collect data on and restrict the number of short-term rentals, also missed the threshold. 
“Tonight brings us to another showdown between two very different visions of a small island facing a very challenging future,” said island resident Charity Benz at the Town Meeting, in which only registered Nantucket voters may vote. Those who supported the citizen’s petition “are obsessed with monetizing Nantucket,” Benz said. “However, those who have seen the impact of the transaction economy on Nantucket over the years have a very different perspective. Too much more of everything is simply unsustainable for the island itself and for the taxpayers who are being asked to subsidize its further exploitation.” 
The transaction economy Benz referenced is a cycle in which lots are purchased, homes enlarged or built, and those houses then sold off or kept for part-time or rental use. Bigger and bigger homes require more and more of a draw on resources, while public employees find it harder to stay on the island where they work. 
As voters shrugged off attempts to codify short-term rental policy over the years, the matter has swirled through the state land court.  
In the series of lawsuits brought by a resident challenging a neighboring property’s right to operate as a short-term rental and the town’s decision to allow it, judge Michael Vhay has consistently decreed that short-term rentals of “primary dwellings” are not explicitly allowed under Nantucket’s zoning bylaw unless they are “accessory” uses.  
In this specific case, he ruled, the use is not allowed even though town government has long behaved as though short-term rentals are acceptable, and he directed the town to enforce the bylaw as he interpreted it. 
The town has filed a motion to stay part of Vhay’s June 6 judgment pending appeal, arguing that this would be extremely disruptive and unusual, because the town has never wielded zoning power against a short-tern rental before and officials believe the use is allowed under local law. 
As Town Meeting warrant efforts stutter and the court case plods along, the island is set to find a few new housing arrows in its quiver this fall.  
State-designated seasonal communities like Nantucket will have access, under last year’s sweeping housing bond bill, to a set of tools including year-round housing occupancy restrictions, artist and public employee housing, and allowing tiny homes to be built by-right and used as year-round housing.  
A dedicated Seasonal Communities Advisory Council, made up of representatives and stakeholders from vacation-home-rich communities around the state, announced in May recommendations for the state housing office to refine the toolkit. The next virtual engagement session on the regulations is scheduled for Wednesday, July 9. 
Among the recommendations are how best to consider the amount of part-time and vacation units, as well as the income disparities between area income and area home sale price. Other recommendations are aimed at easing a core part of the seasonal communities requirements: allowing construction on smaller lots than typically allowed by current zoning. 
These new seasonal communities requirements won’t be washing up on Cape and Islands shores this season – final regulations are expected to be finalized around September – but the task force is recommending a “use it or lose it” approach to the new tools. If communities don’t implement new requirements like adopting bylaws to allow for undersized lot construction within two years, they say, the state should withdraw its toolkit.

The third largest school district in Delaware has a new board president.
Monica Moriak was selected to replace Don Patton after a 4-3 vote secured her victory at the Christina School District board meeting Tuesday night.
This follows almost two years of controversy in the board, which included the removal of former Delaware Superintendent of the Year Don Shelton – who then filed a lawsuit against board members and the district, votes of no confidence for then-President Patton, meetings that lasted five+ hours into the hours of the following morning, accusations that Board Member Naveed Baqir lives outside the country and a subsequent removal request, and too many “point of orders” to count.\

The board also unanimously voted for Y. F. Lou be Moriak’s vice president.
The voting majority in the past couple years had been Moriak, Doug Manley, and Amy Trauth.
Pattton and Baqir voted for new board member Shannon Troncoso, who was in her first meeting since being elected in May.
Baqir is stepping down from the board July 15.
Moriak made it clear she’s trying to restore order to the board, vowing to do her best to follow Robert’s Rules – a longstanding practice of speaking orders and procedures – board policies, and putting student outcomes first.

MU Health Care confirmed Tuesday that it is reviewing a new offer from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield that could restore insurance coverage to an estimated 90,000 Missourians.


The news comes a week after a state Senate hearing failed to result in any sort of agreement between the two actors. The initial deadline for negotiations was April 1, and three months later, efforts to finalize a deal are ongoing.


The newest confirmed offer, made by Anthem on Monday afternoon, follows two failed proposals made at the hearing last week. Neither side released details of the latest offer.
In an email, Anthem said, “During the recent public hearing, Anthem presented two distinct proposals to MU Health Care in an effort to resolve our contractual differences. In a private session following the hearing and again as recently as yesterday, we extended an additional offer aimed at moving toward a resolution.”

MU Health Care spokesperson Rochita Ghosh reiterated the desire for negotiations in a separate email: “Our goal remains to reach an agreement and return in-network access for Anthem members to MU Health Care clinicians and facilities.”


Confirmation of the new offer came as Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, posted a call for action on Facebook, requesting a contract renewal by Thursday. While O’Laughlin, who leads the state Senate, acknowledged in the post that she has little say in the matter, she called Anthem’s proposed offer “reasonable.”


Without providing details, O’Laughlin said, “Anthem doubled their rate increase offer. They also will allow policy exceptions to remain in place (those exceptions allow MU to receive extra insurance coverage on services.) The Anthem proposal increase includes paying doctors more.”

As previously reported, patients with certain complex medical conditions such as pregnancy, cancer treatments or those who have recently undergone surgeries, may still temporarily receive in-network rates and are encouraged to call 573-771-CARE.


Patients who are ineligible to receive the in-network rates may have to pay more money out of pocket to see their current MU Health Care doctors and care team. Alternatively, these patients may need to find new in-network providers through other health systems.

At last week’s hearing, MU Health Care CEO Ric Ransom said the hospital system is seeing operating costs rising approximately 7% year after year.


He said that if the hospital system can acquire an increase in reimbursement from a contract made with Anthem, the money would mainly go toward maintaining clinical operations, including urgent care facilities, new clinics and pharmacies.


In response, Rich Novack, president of commercial markets at Elevance Health, Anthem’s parent company, said MU Health Care twice turned down Anthem offers to create a broader continuity-of-care plan.


Novack also accused MU Health Care of “patient abandonment,” which he said is when a provider refuses to see a patient that they used to see simply because of a change in coverage.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
 

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”



For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland,  wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
 

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Most members of the Kansas State Board of Education voted to increase their pay to equal state legislators, which was commonplace until legislators doubled their pay this year, leaving board members behind.
In a 9-1 vote on Tuesday, the board approved a request for around $126,000 beginning July 1, 2026, to fund the salaries of the 10 board members and make them commensurate with legislator pay.
The last time the board received a raise was nearly two decades ago.
A handful of board members viewed the raises as the right thing to do for future generations. Others were emboldened by the principle of the matter, emphasizing the equivalence of their public service to that of state legislators.
Beryl New, a former Topeka public school administrator and educator, said it was important to look beyond the current board members, many of whom said they didn’t need the pay.
“There are other people who may come on and take my seat who need to know that whatever they’re putting out is honored, appreciated and respected, just as a legislator is,” she said.
The Legislature created a commission that approved raises for lawmakers in 2024. Those raises went into effect in January. The current average annual legislator salary is $43,000, and lawmakers budgeted for an additional 4.4% increase next year. Before legislators raised their pay independently of the board, their salary rates were intertwined. They passed a law in April that permits the state board to set their compensation. It was attached to legislation requiring school districts to show videos in classes on human growth, development and sexuality that depict fetal development.  
Board members currently make $88.66 per day in addition to a subsistence allowance of $166 daily. The $126,000 members approved would bring them up to par with legislative pay, including the future 4.4% raise.
The Legislature’s rationale for pay increases was rooted in its standing as a citizen legislature, said Frank Harwood, deputy education commissioner. Lawmakers argued in 2024 that higher pay would attract more people to the job.
“The question is, does that same logic apply to the state board?” he asked the board.
It appeared it did.
Board members represent the equivalent of four state Senate districts, or around 270,000 people each, Harwood said.
Jim Porter, a longtime educator and administrator from Fredonia, said the board will soon need younger people who can occupy seats long term and offer different perspectives.
“I’m ambivalent when it comes to me, but I’m not ambivalent for the future,” he said.
Betty Arnold, a former state auditor from Wichita, agreed. Education often gets passed over, she said.
“It’s looking to the future. It’s increasing the field of people that could care about education but can’t afford to sit in these seats,” Arnold said.
The vote came at a time when the Kansas State Department of Education is reckoning with a smaller budget and higher costs. The budget crafted by the Legislature didn’t leave the department any wiggle room, so board members approved a slate of requests for budget enhancements. One was so the department could continue to pay rent in the state building it leases for employees.
The U.S. Department of Education is also holding $42.9 million of Kansas funds in limbo.
Debby Potter, a conservative board member from Great Plains, was the only member who voted against the raises. Earlier in the day’s meeting, she also voted to cut funds for teacher professional development.
“If I’m willing to cut professional development, I am willing to cut this,” she said.
Cathy Hopkins, board chair, said: “I am not.”
Hopkins said she lobbied the Legislature this year for board raises to no avail. Her decision was based on principle, she said.
Melanie Haas, an executive from Overland Park, mentioned an old comment from Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who in 2022 called the board “monolithic” as the Legislature was approving a redrawn state education district map that favored more conservative candidates, according to reporting from the Kansas City Star.
To Porter, it boils down to a matter of respect.
He said Masterson’s 2022 comment was a direct insult to the board because it “didn’t do what the Senate president wanted them to do.”
The pay inequity is akin to disrespect toward the board and public education, Porter said.
“We need to be respected,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7080357-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-09 10:13:15.990994

Mike Dunleavy issued last month included millions of dollars proposed by the Legislature to bolster child care and early intervention services for children with disabilities or developmental delays.
Dunleavy vetoed a proposed $1.86 million in additional funding for child care grant programs and place-based and home-based child care centers, citing declining state revenues. The budget retains $5.87 million for those programs for next year. 
For early education and infant learning, the Legislature proposed a significant boost — $5.7 million more — for the state’s 17 programs that provide intervention services for families with children from infancy to 3 years old experiencing disabilities or developmental delays. Dunleavy rejected the increase, and allocated $10 million for the statewide programs. 
“Governor Dunleavy’s goal is for Alaska to be the best place in the country to raise a family,” said Grant Robinson, a deputy press secretary for the governor in an email on Monday responding to a request for comment. “The budgeting process requires the Governor to consider all line items in view of the State’s fiscal situation. The budget the Governor signed still provides more than $5.8 million of funding for childcare benefits. Given the State’s revenue outlook, the Governor made the difficult yet fiscally responsible decision to veto increasing and expanding infant learning programs.”
The governor vetoed more than $127 million from the Legislature’s proposed budget, including $50 million for public schools. In a prerecorded video released with the veto announcement in June, Dunleavy cited lower state revenues due to falling oil prices.
“Basically, we don’t have enough money to pay for all of our obligations. So as a result of that, you’re going to see some reductions in this year’s budget. It’s not an easy thing to do. It’s certainly not a fun thing to do, but it’s necessary,” he said.
Anchorage Republican Sen. Cathy Giessel, who also serves as the Senate majority leader, agreed that the state is facing fiscal challenges, but said child care and early education programs should be prioritized, as the Legislature had proposed.

“We had a balanced budget. It is true, it was very difficult to arrive at that balanced budget,” she said in a phone interview. “We searched all the couch cushions for one-time funding to fund this balanced budget, but we achieved it. The governor’s vetoes of these two critical services are just going to mean future costs, because these services were not provided for kids in their earliest development stages. So I was very disappointed.”
An estimated 1,800 Alaskan families are currently served each year by the state’s infant learning programs, funded by the state and federal Medicaid, at no cost to families. Children and families work with developmental specialists, and can receive speech, physical and occupational therapies. In addition, parents receive training and education on child development.
For example, in the Northwest Arctic region, an early learning and family program is administered by the Northwest Arctic Borough School District. It is based in Kotzebue and serves all the Northwest Arctic villages, as well as Point Hope in the North Slope Borough.
“We’re spread very thin,” said Tracey Schaeffer, one of the program’s three staff members. “And we definitely could use another staff person to help with traveling and seeing families and spending time in the villages.”
There is only one air carrier, Bering Air, serving the region, down from four companies operating a few years ago, she said, so with weather events and disruptions, it’s increasingly challenging. 
“We have to change reservations a lot because of the weather,” she said, estimating the total cost for travel and flights at up to $25,000 per year, plus significant time. “As it gets warmer, we have a lot more days that are not very safe to fly here.” 
Schaeffer said they work as much as possible by phone, but intervention services are very personal. “And all the while, you’re trying to kind of build a relationship with this family, because it’s a really intimate, sensitive situation when you’re working with a family who has a child that experienced, you know, something that wasn’t expected, a disability, or something, a medical issue, that has put their development at risk,” she said. 
The proposed state funding increase would have been welcome, she said. “That would have been a huge relief, because there’s a lot of pressure. I mean, (with) early intervention, three years is a short period of time, you know, and we lose so much time because of weather, flight cancellations or something,” she said. “So there’s a lot of pressure there. We’ve done this job for a long time, and we know the time goes fast, and we want to provide as much intervention as we can. And it’s just hard to do that.”
Schaeffer also runs a small child care center in Kotzebue, serving eight children, the first licensed provider to open in the community in over a decade. She said more local and state support is needed to address the lack of child care and rippling impacts for the community. “We lose people all the time because of a lack of child care. You know, we have educators or providers that come and they start a family, and then they realize, like, ‘Wow, I can’t find a child care provider,’ and we lose them because of that.”
Shaeffer and her daughter opened the child care center in 2023, a challenging process documented in a short film by Laura Norton-Cruz, a social worker, public health advocate and film producer. She and filmmaker Joshua Albeza Branstetter created a documentary film series focused on the challenges of child care and early education programs called the “Early Childhood in Alaska” series.

“Child care is just not a profitable business model. It’s an investment in child brain development and family well-being, and the economy,” Norton-Cruz said, emphasizing the need for increasing state and federal funding support. “Staffing is the majority of the costs. But also, if you run a home-based child care center, you have to pay your mortgage or you have to pay rent, you have to pay utilities: Those things cost money. And we need support from the government to be able to offer this essential service, to have a workforce, and to have children who are kindergarten ready.” 
In April, Anchorage’s largest child care provider, Bright Beginnings Early Learning Center, closed, displacing 125 children. Norton-Cruz said while some progress has been made, like raising awareness around Alaska’s child care crisis, families and providers are still struggling. 
“Others have cut back on hours or cut back on the number of rooms, or the number of kids they can take, in order to have this essential service for parents to be able to go to work, which we need them to do,” she said. “Because we have major workforce shortages, and parents need income to pay for, you know, rent and everything else, we have to do a better job of funding and supporting the sector.”
In 2023, Dunleavy launched a child care task force with the stated goal to develop a plan to improve availability and affordability of quality child care throughout Alaska. Norton-Cruz said the work of the task force was positive, and would like to see the governor put more state funding toward its recommendations.
“When we don’t have policy that supports child care and early childhood, we basically just rely on the unpaid labor of women,” Norton-Cruz said. “Whether that’s moms, or whether that’s grandmothers, or aunties, you can’t just say, ‘Oh, but grandmas and aunties can step in.’ That’s not policy. That relies on something that may not always be there for everyone, and isn’t fair. … People need to be able to make that choice, rather than have that choice made for them.”
Giessel also said there is a need for state funding for the governor’s own task force recommendations. She pointed to new state revenue measures that Dunleavy has opposed —like oil taxes — that leaders in the Alaska House multipartisan and Senate bipartisan majority caucuses want to pursue to bring in more state dollars. 
“First of all, we have a huge gap in our tax structure on our oil resources,” Giessel said, referring to the difference between taxes paid by traditional corporations and by those corporations that report their income through their owners, known as “S corporations.”
“The S corporations pay no corporate tax to the state,” Giessel said. “There is legislation that would institute a requirement for S corporations to pay a corporate tax to the state, conservatively estimated, that would be $100 million per year.”
A bill to tax these corporations is in the Senate Rules Committee.
“That would pay for a huge amount of these child care and early education funding requirements,” Giessel said.
“For him to say that these cuts are because of declining revenue and ignoring his responsibility in this, is just amazing to me,” Giessel added. 
The Legislature will meet for a special session on Aug. 2, when they will consider whether to override the budget vetoes.

By 2029, eyeshadows, nail polishes and other cosmetics that shimmer and shine from plastic glitter could be banned in California.
In the latest push to curb the prevalence of microplastics in the environment, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a first-in-the-nation bill that would ban the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.
The proposal by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner would expand a 2015 state law that already bans microplastic beads in products that are intended to be immediately rinsed off, such as face washes and toothpastes. 
But the latest bill would apply to products that are left on — including lotions and makeup — as well as household products such as cleaners, detergents and paint. Companies add microbeads to these items to give them abrasive or exfoliating properties.
Research has found that microplastics — extremely small particles of plastic that do not break down easily in the environment — detected in the human body could be linked to cardiovascular disease and stroke, cancer, and neurological problems. 
Potentially harmful levels of so-called “forever chemicals” associated with plastics are found in California’s coastal waters and drinking water. State lawmakers recently banned sturdier single-use plastic bags, and attempted to ban the use of forever chemicals in synthetic turf.
This wouldn’t spell the end of California stores stocking glittering makeup, though. Some major cosmetic brands sell products that contain mica, a mineral that can lend makeup its shimmer. Though concerns have been raised about mica sourcing, some research has found that mica could serve as a naturally-occuring alternative to plastic glitter.

Boerner, a Solana Beach Democrat: “I’m all for glitter and glamor. But let it be safe and let it not harm our health. ”

The bill is now before the Senate’s appropriations committee. If passed, California manufacturers and retailers that make, distribute or sell these products would be fined up to $2,500 per day for each violation.

Newsom backtracks on return-to-office policy

As part of new labor agreements with some of California’s state workers unions, Gov. Gavin Newsom agreed to delay his return-to-office policy. But the move has raised certain doubts about the governor’s original intentions among some labor leaders and proponents of in-person work alike, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
In March the governor ordered state workers back to the office at least four days a week, starting July 1, saying that “in-person work makes us all stronger.” 
A few weeks before that policy was to take effect, however, the union representing state engineers struck a labor deal to pause that mandate for one year. Two other unions, including SEIU Local 1000, reached a deal to delay the order.
Anica Walls, SEIU Local 1000’s president, said the pause is “a direct result of our members fighting back.” But also that members considered Newsom’s about-face as having “more to do with politics and pressure than performance.”

CalFire chatbot not up to snuff?

A CalFire chatbot to help Californians access important fire prevention information and “near-real-time emergency information,” is stumbling at answering basic questions, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
When it debuted in May, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot was intended to provide, among other things, resources on wildfire incidents and home hardening, according to Newsom’s office.
But two months after its launch, Malena found that the chatbot sometimes spits out different answers to questions that mean the same thing. It also doesn’t generate the most up-to-date wildfire information and is unable to provide information about evacuation orders.
CalFire says it’s working on improving the tool, but some experts say that not only should the kinks have been ironed out before the rollout, but that the public should have had more input too.
The chatbot is part of Newsom’s 2023 executive order to develop more AI tools to improve government efficiency. Other AI-powered tools in development for the state include ones related to highway congestion and tax preparation.

The California Highway Patrol — one of the state’s largest police forces — plans to equip all its officers with body cameras by next year. The move comes three years after CalMatters reported that only 3% of highway patrol officers had body-worn cameras. Learn more from CalMatters’ Byrhonda Lyons. 






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom’s visit to South Carolina this week — an important state in the early stages of the presidential primaries — lends more evidence that he is eyeing a bid for the nation’s highest office.
California should keep investigating OpenAI, since the company has still yet to clarify how it will maintain its nonprofit oversight amid its various business deals, write Orson Aguilar and Catherine Bracy, CEOs of LatinoProsperity and TechEquity, respectively.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-09 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Does a Confederate monument represent Brandon? Locals weigh in at town hall,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Lili Euzet,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/09/does-a-confederate-monument-represent-brandon-locals-weigh-in-at-town-hall/,Brandon residents voiced their opinions on whether to relocate a Confederate stutue from the city's center.,"BRANDON — Rankin County residents packed Brandon City Hall to discuss whether a Confederate statue belongs in the town center where a bulk of local traffic flows. But most took stances on whether it represents heritage or hate.
“It’s hatred,” Janie Mclaurin-Wheaton said at the meeting Monday. “You want to leave ‘that’ history, but you want to take mine out of the school? What about my history? I was born here, too.”
Mclaurin-Wheaton, who is Black, was a member of the first graduating class to integrate Brandon High School and was referring to a new law that seeks to restrict teachers from discussing “divisive”concepts like slavery and the causes of the Civil War. Her grandfather was the first Black man in Rankin County to own land and a car. She was one of the first Black women hired in the Rankin County Tax Assessor’s office, where she worked for 27 years.

She joined some 80 neighbors — Black and white–  with deep roots in the city and county to speak before the Brandon Board of Aldermen. Dozens crowded into chairs before the first speaker approached the podium at 6 p.m. City hall employees were forced to unfold extra chairs in the hallway when space ran out.
This discussion follows a June 16 meeting, during which Brandon city leaders approved a first step to assess the cost and logistics of relocating the 37-foot-tall statue of an unknown soldier built in 1907. Mayor Butch Lee cast the tie-breaking vote.
In an interview with WAPT, Lee said the statue is “in harm’s way.” He cited three cars that have recently struck it as well as a recent incident in which it was shot at.
Few locals cited the traffic concern as a top priority. Lee and the board drew condemnation from audience members who questioned why the decision wasn’t left to the voters. 
A favored candidate for the relocation is the Confederate part of the Brandon cemetery – a location some feel could hold and preserve the historical monument without glorifying a difficult part of American history.

“There could not be a more serene, more dignified place to address this history than Brandon’s cemetery,” said Lance Stevens, an attorney and 30-year Brandon resident.
Bettye Ward Fletcher, a Black Rankin County native, called for the city to move the statue she sees as a harmful symbol.
“It continues to be painful,” she said. “Your hometown continues to honor the men that fought to maintain you and your people in slavery.”
“I want something different for my grandkids,” said Will Sims, a Black U.S. Air Force veteran who expressed disappointment with seeing the monument still standing when he returned from years in the service.
However, for some residents, the monument and its history are nothing to be ashamed of.
Former longtime Rankin County Assistant District Attorney Dan Duggan pulled out a portrait of his great-great grandfather, a Confederate soldier, for the board to see. The fifth-generation Southerner said removing the monument would be a betrayal to the memory of his ancestors and other soldiers.
“This is a memorial to soldiers who left their homes to defend their country, the Confederate States of America, against an invading force,” said Mark Allen, a longtime resident of Rankin County and descendant of a Confederate soldier.
Brandon’s Confederate monument was erected across from the courthouse where Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman ordered his Union troops to stack their arms as a sign of military occupation of the town, according to the National Register of Historic Places.
In February 1864, Sherman largely burned Brandon as part of what modern historians call a practice run for his famous March to the Sea, in which he employed “total war” that burned and pillaged everything in his army’s path. 
“It’s a place that people could go to that’s maybe the only representation that they had of their relative who had never come home,” said Allen. 
However, some argued that the statue is a symbol of white power rather than a memorial to fallen ancestors. It was erected 42 years after the end of the Civil War, at a time when white Mississippians worked to ensure the marginalization of Black residents. In 1890, the Mississippi constitution enshrined the disenfranchisement of Black residents into law. By 1900, virtually no Black residents could vote despite constituting 59% of the population. 
John Toney, a local attorney, brought up that Brandon spent $3,000 – what would amount to $105,000  today – on the statue.
“They used these monuments to start a political and cultural dialogue,” Toney said. “On the north side of the statue is carved into the marble: state’s rights and home rule will rise again. That’s not a dog whistle, that’s a training whistle.”
“I doubt any Blacks voted in 1907 to spend taxpayer money on the statue,” said Toney.
Despite its complicated past, some claimed the historical monument should be preserved.
“It’s our history. Whether it’s bad or good, let’s not try to second guess it,” said Sharon Neely Egan, a white resident who opposes the removal of the statue. “I don’t think we need to erase Brandon’s history.”
Still, many feel that leaving a monument built as a homage to the Confederacy in one of Brandon’s busiest streets is siding with a skewed version of history, and disregarding the pain it evokes to Black residents.
“Our past is important, but there’s a difference between remembering and honoring,” said Brandon Middle School principal Trey Rein. “We have an opportunity here to make a statement that we are focused on our town’s future more than its past.”
The rain let up just after 7 p.m. as speakers and spectators exited city hall for their cars and homes. Mclaurin-Wheaton departed with some of her classmates from Brandon High School. They are still good friends today.
“I just see some people stuck in the past and don’t know how to move forward,” Mclaurin-Wheaton said. “That’s because mama told you, daddy told you, sister told you, but when you become of age, you got to learn to do the right thing for yourself.”
The next public discussion over this topic will be July 21 at Brandon City Hall.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08160604/IMG_2102-1.jpg,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193
,California,2025-07-09 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Cal Fire rolled out an AI chatbot. Don’t ask it about evacuation orders,Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/07/cal-fire-chatbot/,The bot fails at some basic questions about fires. Cal Fire says it is working on fixes.,"In summary
The bot fails at some basic questions about fires. Cal Fire says it is working on fixes.


California government agencies are going all-in on generative artificial intelligence tools under  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2023 executive order to improve government efficiency with AI. One of the first to roll out is a chatbot from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the primary agency tasked with coordinating the state’s wildfire response.
The chatbot is meant to give Californians better access to “critical fire prevention resources and near-real-time emergency information,” according to a May release from Newsom’s office. But CalMatters found that it fails to accurately describe the containment of a given wildfire, doesn’t reliably provide information such as a list for evacuation supplies and can’t tell users about evacuation orders.
Newsom has announced AI applications for traffic, housing and customer service to be implemented in the coming months and years. But Cal Fire’s chatbot issues raise questions about whether agencies are following best practices.
“Evaluation is not an afterthought,” said Daniel Ho, law professor at Stanford University whose research focuses on government use of AI. “It should be part of the standard expectation when we pilot and roll out a system like this.”
The chatbot uses the Cal Fire website and the agency’s ReadyForWildfire.org to generate answers. It can tell users about topics such as active wildfires, the agency, fire preparedness tips and Cal Fire’s programs. It was built by Citibot, a South Carolina-based company that sells AI-powered chatbots for local government agencies across the country. Cal Fire plans to host the tool until at least 2027, according to procurement records.
“It really was started with the intent and the goal of having a better-informed public about Cal Fire,” said Issac Sanchez, deputy chief of communications for the agency.
When CalMatters asked Cal Fire’s bot questions about what fires were currently active and basic information about the agency, it returned accurate answers. But for other information, CalMatters found that the chatbot can give different answers when the wording of the query changes slightly, even if the meaning of the question remains the same. 
For example, an important way Californians can prepare for fire season is assembling a bag of emergency supplies should they need to evacuate. Only “What should I have in my evacuation kit?” returned a specific list of items from Cal Fire’s chatbot. Variations of the question that included “go bag,” “wildfire ready kit” and “fire preparedness kit” instead returned either a prompt to visit Cal Fire’s “Ready for Wildfire” site, which has that information, or a message saying “I’m not sure about the specific items you should have” and the wildfire site link. Two of those terms are present on the site the chatbot referenced.
And while the chatbot didn’t generate incorrect answers in any of the queries CalMatters made, it doesn’t always pull the most up-to-date information. 
When asked if the Ranch Fire, a 4,293-acre fire in San Bernardino County, was contained, the chatbot said that the “latest” update as of June 10 showed the fire was 50% contained. At the time CalMatters queried the chatbot, the information was six days out of date – the fire was 85% contained by then. 
Similarly, when asked about current job openings at the agency, the chatbot said there weren’t any. A search on the state’s job site showed two positions at Cal Fire accepting applications at the time. 
Mila Gascó-Hernandez is research director for the University at Albany’s Center for Technology in government and has studied how public agencies use AI-powered chatbots. Two key factors she uses to evaluate such chatbots are the accuracy of information they provide and how consistently they answer the same questions even if the question is asked in different ways.
“If a fire is coming and you need to know how to react to it, you do need both accuracy and consistency in the answer,” she said. “You’re not going to think about ‘what’s the nice way to ask the chatbot?’”
Currently, the chatbot is unable to provide information about evacuation orders associated with fires. When asked who issues evacuation orders, it sometimes correctly said law enforcement, while other times said it didn’t know. Cal Fire’s Sanchez said it’s reasonable to expect the chatbot to be able to answer questions about evacuations. 
If there are no evacuation orders for a particular fire, he said, “the answer should be ‘there doesn’t appear to be any evacuations associated with this incident.’” 
Sanchez said he and his team of about four people tested the chatbot before it went out by submitting questions they expected the public to ask. Cal Fire is currently making improvements to the bot’s answers by combing through the queries people make and ensuring that the chatbot correctly surfaces the needed answer. 
When CalMatters asked the bot “What can you help me with?” in early May, it responded, “Sorry I don’t have the answer to that question right now” and asked if CalMatters had questions about information on the Cal Fire site. By mid-June, that answer was updated to being able to “provide answers to questions related to information located on this page such as details about current fires, CAL FIRE job classifications, examination requirements and CAL FIRE’s various programs.” 
“The big message we want to get across,” Sanchez said, “is be patient.”
But experts said the process of kicking the tires on a chatbot should happen long before procurement begins. 
The preferred process, Stanford’s Ho said, is to establish criteria for how the chatbot should perform before a vendor is selected so there are clear benchmarks to evaluate the tool. Ideally, those benchmarks are created by an independent third party. There should also be an evaluation of the benefits and risks before the chatbot is released.
And in a best-case scenario, the public would be involved before launch, Albany’s Gascó-Hernandez said. Agencies interested in using chatbots should identify the questions the public is likely to ask the AI tool ahead of time, ensure those are representative of the expected population the agency serves and refine the chatbot by having members of the public pilot the system to ensure it provides the kind of information they seek.
“These user engagement and user experiences are very important so the citizen ends up using the chabot,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/012225-Castaic-Fire-CalFire-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

Just days after abandoning its planned conversion to a for-profit entity and proclaiming it would remain a nonprofit, OpenAI puzzled us with another announcement: a nearly $6.5 billion deal to buy io, a start-up created by former Apple executive and iPhone designer Jony Ive. 
This isn’t the only business deal OpenAI has in the works. The company also announced plans to build a massive new data center in the United Arab Emirates and has reportedly purchased AI startup Windsurf.
If anyone was under the impression that OpenAI’s decision to remain a nonprofit is a win for the public, its profit-driven business moves should put that to rest. Deals like these, which require OpenAI to sell stakes in the company, erode the nonprofit’s control of the business. 
Meanwhile, OpenAI has still not answered fundamental questions about how their conversion to a public benefit corporation will maintain the nonprofit’s independent oversight. Which of OpenAI’s entities owns the technologies it develops? How will OpenAI avoid conflicts of interest and self-dealing among executives and investors? Who will reap the funds that the for-profit sows? Most of all, what happens when shareholder interests conflict with the public interest that the nonprofit is legally bound to serve?
Without answers to these critical questions, the investigations into OpenAI’s structure by the California and Delaware attorneys general must continue.  
OpenAI was originally founded as a nonprofit to ensure artificial intelligence would benefit all of humanity. Today, it is operating under a structure that allows profit and commercial gain to take priority over its mission to serve the public good. 
Since 2019, OpenAI has methodically shifted power away from its nonprofit parent organization into a tangled web of business deals and investor relationships. Meanwhile, the nonprofit increasingly plays the role of a weak and passive bystander rather than a steward of the public interest — its assets are largely unaccounted for and its ability to steer AI toward meaningful public benefits is deeply compromised.
OpenAI’s latest pivot is a clever rebranding of its problematic business-as-usual approach. It’s a way to deflect lawsuits, avoid further scrutiny and put the interests of investors ahead of the everyday people OpenAI is legally required to serve.
The public deserves answers and transparency. While disputes over governance structures and the legalities of nonprofit ownership may seem tedious and disconnected from the lives of everyday people, OpenAI’s future has huge implications for the well-being of society. 
On the one hand, artificial intelligence is leading to breakthroughs that are helping us adapt to climate change, detect deadly diseases and simply give us more time back in our busy lives. On the opposite end, the technology is also accelerating greenhouse gas emissions, while leading to wrongful incarceration, unemployment and worldwide misinformation. 
In OpenAI’s own founding words: “It’s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it’s equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly.” If OpenAI’s charitable assets were separated from its commercial interests and put into the hands of a fully independent nonprofit that can carry out its original mission, there is a much better chance of ensuring the positive future vision for AI than the negative.
That’s why the attorneys general of California and Delaware need to take decisive action in their ongoing investigations into OpenAI’s restructuring. There must be robust investigation and oversight of OpenAI’s governance structure, including a review of past compliance with California charitable law. All nonprofit assets unrelated to governance should be fairly valued and required to transfer to a new, fully independent charitable entity dedicated to maximizing public benefit. Lastly, the nonprofit board’s needs true independence and ongoing oversight power to hold OpenAI accountable.
OpenAI started as a nonprofit, which means it must serve the public good, not private interests. Yet for years, OpenAI has been using those charitable assets for commercial purposes, violating its mission. There must be a clear separation. That’s what OpenAI promised when it started, and it’s what the public deserves.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/060225-Sam-Altman-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C727&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

Despite felony convictions in fatal crashes, several local drivers have regained licenses under a system that operates with no public tracking, few safeguards and rising calls for reform.


This story is the result of a monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat in partnership with CalMatters.
Before dawn broke on a quiet Monday in October 2019, Kellie Nora Michelle was asleep in her van on Hoen Avenue in Santa Rosa — her dog curled beside her, the van their only shared refuge.
She never saw the car coming.
Traveling 90 mph in a 35 mph zone, Angel Ivan Martinez flew around a bend in the two-lane street, drunk behind the wheel of a Dodge Charger. He slammed into Michelle’s parked van with such force that it launched the vehicle into a power pole, then a tree, then another car. The wreckage sprawled across the block like shrapnel.
“I remember it being a horrific scene,” recalled Santa Rosa police Sgt. Patricia Seffens, who arrived that morning as a patrol officer. “The debris field was so expansive.”
Michelle and her dog died instantly. She was 50 — a mother, a Sonoma County native and a Rancho Cotate High School graduate. Friends and family described her as smart and free-spirited, someone who struggled with mental health issues, addiction and bouts of homelessness. At the time, she was renting a room nearby but chose to sleep in her van so she could stay with her dog, who didn’t get along with another pet inside.
Martinez’s license was revoked. He pleaded no contest in August 2020 to felony vehicular manslaughter and DUI.
And then — four years later — the state gave his license back.
Despite killing someone, and later being arrested for driving unlicensed and giving police a false name, Martinez was issued a new California driver’s license in 2023. It’s valid through 2027.
He is not an outlier.

A system designed to restart
A monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat, in partnership with CalMatters, found that California routinely restores driver’s licenses to people convicted of killing someone behind the wheel — often while drunk, speeding or fleeing the scene.
In Sonoma County alone, at least 47 people have been charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019, according to data compiled by The Press Democrat and CalMatters. At least three, including Martinez, were convicted of felonies, lost their licenses and are already back on the road. Others could follow soon.

Similar cases have emerged in neighboring Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties.
It’s all legal. It’s happening quietly. And the state doesn’t track it.
California allows most drivers convicted in fatal collisions — particularly in cases involving alcohol, drugs or extreme recklessness — to reapply for a license after a revocation period that typically lasts three years. In some cases, they continue driving even before their criminal cases are resolved.
Drivers facing revocation can challenge the Department of Motor Vehicles’ decision, but they must act within days of being notified. Otherwise, they must wait out the revocation period, then reapply — passing tests, paying fees and, in some cases, completing rehabilitation courses.

By the numbers
A CalMatters analysis this spring found nearly 40% of Californians charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 still held valid licenses, including drivers with vehicular manslaughter convictions.
The Press Democrat took the next step — identifying drivers in the North Bay who regained driving privileges even after felony convictions.
Among them, according to DMV records:

A Granite Bay man who killed an 8-month-old child in a multi-car crash on Lakeville Highway near Petaluma in 2018, at the age of 18.
A Santa Rosa man convicted in 2020 for a fatal hit-and-run on Highway 12.
A Mendocino County man convicted in a fiery crash that killed his passenger in August 2020 on Highway 101 in Ukiah.

There was no consistent pattern in convictions or license reinstatements by race, income or gender, according to an analysis of the available data.
Because the state does not track how often driver’s licenses are reinstated after fatal crashes, The Press Democrat reviewed dozens of vehicular manslaughter cases from late 2018 through early 2025 in Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties. Sonoma County had by far the highest number of cases — around 50 — while the others each had about 20.
For this story, cases were narrowed to older felony collisions that resulted in convictions, had accessible court and DMV records, and were old enough that revocation periods could have ended. A full accounting was not possible.
Out of 106 cases compiled by The Press Democrat and CalMatters, DMV records show that at least eight drivers involved in fatal crashes before 2020 have had their licenses reissued, including four in Sonoma County and two each in Napa and Mendocino counties. Some regained their licenses as early as April 2023.
What the DMV doesn’t disclose is how often it denies reinstatement or imposes permanent revocation — a step more common in vehicular murder cases. The agency did not respond to requests for that data.
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, previously told CalMatters that drivers must be given a path to regain their licenses and that the agency has no process for revoking them permanently.
‘No way to justify it’
Matthew Swoyer remembers the 2018 Lakeville Highway crash vividly.
He was driving home to Fairfield when a Volkswagen Jetta crossed into oncoming traffic outside Petaluma and struck a Ford Explorer carrying a mother, her baby and several other children. The Jetta then spun out and hit Swoyer’s car.
“I remember getting out and a bunch of people stopping. Pure chaos,” said Swoyer, now 32 and living in Dixon.
He had to crawl out through the passenger door. The baby girl was killed. Six others, including Swoyer, were hurt. Other motorists pulled over to help.
The Jetta’s driver, Ryan Deloye, faced multiple charges — vehicular manslaughter, reckless driving, cellphone use, and alcohol and cannabis violations. He pleaded no contest in 2020. His license was restored in April 2023. A month later, a red-light camera caught him failing to stop in Sacramento County. DMV records did not show any other violations.
Swoyer had followed Deloye’s court case but didn’t know he’d gotten his license back.
“One hundred percent he should never be allowed to drive again,” Swoyer said. “What he was doing was absolutely outrageous. There’s no way to justify that he was just being a kid.”

Lawmakers respond
State lawmakers are now weighing changes.
Assembly Transportation Committee Chair Lori Wilson told The Press Democrat she plans to introduce legislation requiring license revocations to be consecutive — not concurrent — with jail or prison sentences. That would mean a convicted driver serves time before the clock starts on losing driving privileges.
“Part of that learning your lesson, so to speak, and being held accountable and experiencing consequences is that you should be able to drive,” Wilson said. “Every day that you want to go somewhere, you have the burden of using public transit or relying on someone willing to give you a ride.”
Wilson said she expects to introduce the bill next year. CalMatters’ reporting, she added, helped expose gaps in a policy that hasn’t been updated in years.
“It’s ineffective because it’s not being followed,” she said.
Wilson noted that manslaughter, unlike murder, is considered less malicious under the law. She said she believes some people should be allowed to earn back their licenses after meaningful rehabilitation.
“Should they pay forever for that mistake?” she said. “If they’re properly rehabilitated, they now understand the weight of that brief decision.”
The DMV does not track how often it reinstates licenses after fatal crashes. In a written statement to The Press Democrat, the department said its action are “controlled by statute,” citing state laws that require revocation for certain convictions but allow reinstatement later.
The agency also has discretion to suspend or revoke licenses after fatal collisions, but it does not report how often it uses that power.
In practice, the DMV and courts operate on separate tracks. A judge might impose jail time or probation, but the DMV’s countdown to reinstatement hinges on when it’s notified of a conviction. CalMatters recently found courts across California have often failed to report convictions to the DMV in a timely manner.
The result: a system that routinely returns licenses to drivers whose decisions once proved deadly.

The next wave
Dozens of vehicular manslaughter cases remain pending in North Bay courts. DMV records for recent convictions aren’t always updated. And defense attorneys often argue the charges don’t reflect their clients’ typical driving behavior.
In Petaluma, 79-year-old Beverly Klevin was killed Feb. 1, 2024, when another car struck her on Lakeville Highway. Her family later reached a $650,000 settlement with the city, alleging the road was unsafe.
The other driver, Samir Bhumbla, has pleaded not guilty to gross vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. His attorney says Bhumbla has maintained safe driving habits and still holds a valid license.
In another pending case, 75-year-old Linda Cathleen Johnson, of Sebastopol, is accused of killing Novato resident Lemuel Rodas Diaz, 53, in a suspected DUI crash in December 2023 near Roblar and Stony Point roads. Johnson suffered serious injuries. Her attorney says she voluntarily surrendered her license and hasn’t driven since.
And in Napa, 31-year-old resident Yesica Barajas is charged with gross vehicular manslaughter in the March 16 crash that killed her children, 10-year-old Damian and 9-year-old Aaliyah. Her attorney sought her release pending trial, but a judge denied it.
More drivers in these cases could someday reapply for licenses under current state rules.
A flashpoint for reform?
Advocates remain divided.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving told The Press Democrat that drivers who kill while impaired should face far steeper penalties, including lifetime revocation.
“If a person adjudicated for a fatal impaired driving crash is found guilty, that offender should face a significant, if not lifetime, license revocation after they are released from incarceration,” the group said.
Others argue license restoration offers a path back to society, especially when a fatal crash results a moment of negligence rather than a pattern of reckless behavior.
Still, even after convictions, some drivers continue breaking the rules of the road — in ways both brazen, like driving without a license, and mundane, like rolling through a stop.
In Mendocino County, for example, Kyle Pinckney pleaded no contest in April 2023 to charges from a 2021 Fort Bragg crash that killed his passenger. Months later, he was cited for driving without a valid license. DMV records show he was issued a new license in April 2024, valid through 2029.
Back on Hoen Avenue in Santa Rosa, traffic still hums past the curve just before Cypress Way — the same stretch where Kellie Michelle’s life ended before the sun came up.
The speed limit sign still reads 35 mph.
And Angel Ivan Martinez is driving again.

How The Press Democrat reported this story
This story is the result of a monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat in partnership with CalMatters. Reporter Colin Atagi reviewed more than 100 fatal crash cases across Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties dating back to late 2018.
Atagi reviewed court records, DMV data and Press Democrat archives to identify drivers who faced criminal charges — and in many cases, regained their licenses.
The dataset was narrowed to cases with accessible documentation, completed convictions and enough time passed to assess whether license reinstatement had occurred.
The Press Democrat also sought comment from crash survivors, victims’ families, defense attorneys, prosecutors, state officials and advocates. Some declined to comment or did not respond.

In 2015, now-retired Assemblymember Reginald Jones-Sawyer pitched a $10 million plan to give all CHP officers body cameras. Lawmakers landed on a one-year, $1 million pilot program. Officers recorded nearly 93,000 videos within that year, but the program was never expanded.
In 2022, CalMatters’ story noted that the pilot project had only led to 237 body cameras agency-wide, putting the CHP far behind local law enforcement agencies. At the time, the agency said it was focused on upgrading its dash cam system. Five months later, CHP sought funding for body cameras for all its officers, and state lawmakers approved the budget request.
So far about 2,400 body-worn cameras have been handed out to officers in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and the Sacramento area,  according to CHP spokesperson Jaime Coffee. In total, all 7,600 officers are expected to receive their cameras by March 2026, she said.
“This is the perfect example of it moving too slow,” Jones-Sawyer said. “I always knew this needed to happen. I was just 10 years ahead of my time.”
Highway patrol officers make around 2 million stops a year, according to data from the state Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board. Officers have also been used for work outside of state highways. They’ve been deployed during the federal government’s immigration raids in LA, used to fight crime in Oakland and police drag races, among other things.
There’s little research on whether body-worn cameras reduce police violence. However, a 2022 study found some evidence that, after three years, agencies with body cameras saw a decrease in police killings compared with agencies that did not. 
Since 2023, state lawmakers have given CHP nearly $20 million for the new cameras and have planned $5 million in ongoing funding to support the new system.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/091324_CHP-Graduation_FM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193
,California,2025-07-09 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why Newsom backtracked on ordering state workers back to the office,Maya C. Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/state-workers-return-to-office/,Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed his mandate that most state employees return to the office four days a week in a deal with unions. Labor leaders say his claim of “operational necessity” now rings hollow.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed his mandate that most state employees return to the office four days a week in a deal with unions. Labor leaders say his claim of “operational necessity” now rings hollow.


Tens of thousands of California state employees were bracing to return to the office on July 1 after Gov. Gavin Newsom declared there was an “operational necessity” for all California state employees to work in person a minimum of four days per week. 
That changed just before the deadline when CalHR, which represents the governor in collective bargaining, negotiated a set of deals with public employee unions that delayed the mandate for a year. Relieved workers welcomed the news. 
Yet labor leaders – and even some in-office evangelists – said the governor’s willingness to suddenly drop his demand proved the order was a clever political move and undermined his insistence that in-person work is superior, necessary for productivity and builds public trust.  
“Many of our members feel the sudden shift toward rigid (return to office) policies had more to do with politics and pressure than performance,” wrote Anica Walls, president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000, in an email. The union, the largest in California state government, represents almost 96,000 state employees. “This pause is a direct result of our members fighting back.”
Walls declined multiple requests for an interview and insisted that CalMatters send questions in writing.
Many state workers had been on edge since March when Newsom penned the executive order that would have required an estimated 108,000 employees who still worked a hybrid schedule to return to the office nearly full time. The new order doubled the number of required in-office days from two to four, building on Newsom’s first crackdown on work-from-home in April 2023.
Several state employee unions filed grievances, and two groups sued Newsom and CalHR, the state’s human resources agency, alleging that the administration’s order wrongfully sidestepped the collective bargaining process by unilaterally changing working conditions.
Aggrieved state employees also fundraised more than $30,000 to erect billboards around Sacramento that accused Newsom of creating traffic jams. Many workers argued the state had downsized some locations so there would not even be enough room for them to work in person.
Lawmakers, whom the public employee unions view as allies, questioned whether the state was ready to suddenly bring so many workers back to the office. They didn’t get clear answers. 
‘You don’t have numbers for us’
During budget hearings in April and May, members of the Assembly subcommittee that oversees government administration grilled officials from CalHR and the Department of Government Services about how much it would cost to have tens of thousands of workers come in four days a week instead of two. 
The lawmakers didn’t hide their exasperation when administration officials admitted they did not  even have a rough estimate. 
“I’m still really astonished that you don’t have numbers for us,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Democrat who represents Hayward, during a May 22 committee hearing. 
“This is pretty bewildering,” echoed Democratic Assemblymember Matt Haney of San Francisco.
But Newsom maintained that the benefits of in-person work, such as increased collaboration, communication and mentorship for newer employees, were undermined by the two-day in-office policy since teams weren’t required to come in on the same days. Four days in office would mitigate that issue.  
The tension escalated in May after Newsom announced the state faced a $12 billion budget problem and suggested delaying state worker pay raises for a year, as well as pausing contributions to their retiree health care funds, to cut costs.
Ultimately, CalHR reached new labor agreements with three unions, including the state’s largest, to delay the in-office order until July 2026. Those new deals also included some of the cost savings the governor wanted.
SEIU Local 1000 recently agreed to offset a 3% pay raise this year with five extra hours of “unpaid” leave time each month. The agreement, which affects about a third of the union’s 96,000 represented workers, could ultimately cost the state more since an employee’s accrued hours gain value as their pay rises over time. Many state workers wait to cash out unused leave when they retire, typically at their highest pay rate.

Proponents of in-office work were also dismayed by Newsom’s about-face. Michael Genest, who served as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s finance director, said telework shouldn’t be used as a privilege to sweeten contract negotiations.
“Why is this a bargaining chip?” Genest said. “What it shows is a complete lack of respect for the idea that the taxpayer is paying for something that’s of value.”
Only a fraction have returned to the office
Of the estimated 108,000 employees who continue to work hybrid schedules, only a fraction of them have been required to return to office because their unions did not make agreements to delay the order. Many are state scientists, whose union spent four years fighting for a contract and eventually staged California’s first state worker strike before closing a deal in August 2024. 
The scientists’ union, the California Association of Professional Scientists, has so far refused the state’s requests to reopen its contract and negotiate the salary concessions the other unions traded for the extra year of remote work privileges. 
“The governor’s RTO mandate is not grounded in any logic, data, or operational need. It’s political,” said Jacqueline Tkac, the scientists’ union president, in a written statement. “We are open to collaboration with the state on this issue, but refuse to compromise our contract to participate in Gov. Newsom’s political games.”
When asked to explain his sudden willingness to delay the return-to-office order, the governor’s office did not respond. In an emailed statement, CalHR spokesperson Camille Travis praised the “collaborative approach” with unions that led to the agreement.
“Departments were preparing to implement the return to office order, and this one-year delay gives us the opportunity to refine those plans and work with our teams to ensure a smooth transition,” Travis wrote. 
Genest said Newsom’s sudden reversal on the in-office order, just a week before it was set to take effect, created unnecessary whiplash for departments that were scrambling to prepare enough office space to accommodate returning employees. 
“If he’s telling the departments, ‘Gear up,’ and then he’s later going to say, ‘Oh, never mind, we’re going to be able to pay them less so you don’t have to gear up,’” Genest said, “that’s a very cynical thing.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/060823_SEIU_State_Workers_March_JH_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193
,California,2025-07-09 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Trump administration may revoke designation for new Chuckwalla National Monument,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/07/chuckwalla-national-monument-inland-empire/,"The Trump administration may look to reverse the monument designation for the  Chuckwalla Monument after the Department of Justice cleared the way changes to 625,000 acres in Riverside County.","In summary
The Trump administration may look to reverse the monument designation for the  Chuckwalla Monument after the Department of Justice cleared the way changes to 625,000 acres in Riverside County.


One of former President Joe Biden’s last official acts was declaring the Chuckwalla National Monument on almost 625,000 acres of “canyon-carved mountain ranges” in Riverside County.
This spring President Donald Trump asked the Department of the Interior to consider removing those protections. In May the Department of Justice concluded that Trump “can and should” reverse the monument designations.
But this week, the White House Press Office told CalMatters that nothing is set in stone: “We would not get ahead of the President on any policy changes that may or may not be planned,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email.
Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of Vet Voice Foundation, which lobbied for the Chuckwalla National Monument designation, said the administration might be thinking twice about reversing that status after blowback from a recent proposal in the House Budget Bill to sell off public lands.
“Veterans, hunters, anglers, a lot of people who are not traditionally invested in politics who came out to say hands off our public lands,” she said. 
Speculation that the Trump administration could revoke monument status for more than half a million acres of protected land in California has environmentalists fretting, but some outdoor recreation and mining advocates hope to undo what they call a “lame duck land grab.”
The Chuckwalla National Monument hugs the southern edge of Joshua Tree National Park and extends eastward across the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. 
Tribal trails thread through the monument and the region is considered culturally and spiritually important to numerous tribes, Biden’s proclamation stated. It’s also home to endangered desert tortoise and desert pupfish, and rare species of aster, sage and cholla, that “grow nowhere else on Earth,” according to Sierra magazine.
“This is not just a bare landscape out in the desert,” tribal engagement strategist Donald Medart, a member of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, told CalMatters. “This is a living, breathing, thriving place, where people have lived since time immemorial. We intend to protect it by any means possible.”
Biden dedicated the monument in the final days of his term, but it got off to an inauspicious start. The White House had planned to celebrate with a ceremony at Chuckwalla on Jan. 7, then cancelled it amid powerful winds that fanned catastrophic fires in Los Angeles that day. Biden issued a proclamation establishing the monument a week later.
On his inauguration day Jan. 20, Trump declared an “energy emergency” to fast-track power projects, and ordered the Interior Department to look at the new monuments. Officials pored over geological maps to identify their oil and mining potential, the Washington Post reported.
In May, a Michigan gold miner, an Idaho-based off-road vehicle organization and a conservative Texas think tank sued the federal government to overturn the Chuckwalla monument designation, alleging that it restricts access to public lands for recreation and amateur mining. However, Biden’s proclamation preserves existing rights to use of the land.
Chance Weldon, director of litigation of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that’s true, but future mine claims and trails could be off limits. He said the foundation believes that vast national monuments declared by presidential proclamation are a misuse of the Antiquities Act, which authorizes their creation.
“When you have thousands of acres being taken off line, that’s something that should be decided by Congress, not by the president at the stroke of a pen,” Weldon said.
Goldbeck questioned the plaintiffs’ basis for challenging the monument: “This is an out of state entity being represented by another out of state entity, trying to undo something that Californians love and fought for.”
Environmental and tribal groups have argued that once a president dedicates a monument it can’t be undone. But in June the Department of Justice told Trump he could eliminate monuments if he thinks the space or structures they contain “either never were or no longer are deserving of the (Antiquities) Act’s protections.”
Some local officials have also balked at what they consider restrictions of Chuckwalla National Monument. The city of Blythe weighed in against the designation, arguing that it would hurt tourism, solar development and the local economy.
It’s unclear whether those objections are part of the administration’s calculations. Trump has put the brakes on alternative energy development, and on Monday directed the treasury to end tax credits for wind and solar programs.
In a recent Senate hearing, Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested that the monument is just too big.
“The question is not whether the monuments serve the purpose, I think the real question is the size,” Burgum said, responding to questions from California Sen. Alex Padilla.
Burgum said he has heard concerns from residents of other states that local communities weren’t consulted on recent monuments, but he noted that wasn’t the case in California. Padilla thanked him for acknowledging California’s public review efforts and said the Trump administration should follow the same process for any changes to Chuckwalla National Monument.
“If it’s going to be revisited or undone, we expect that same level of engagement on the back end before any action is taken or before any decisions are made,” Padilla said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010625-Chuckwalla-Mountains-National-Monument-Getty-DM-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

The vote was 4-2.
The resolution sponsored by Mayor Danise Henriquez authorizes Key West City Manager Brian Barroso to enter into the agreement to allow the Police Department to receive training and participate in federal immigration operations. The resolution also says that the city “should not adopt or maintain any sanctuary policies” as defined by Florida law. It took effect immediately.
Approval of the resolution came less than a week after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier warned that the commission had violated Florida law when it voided an earlier agreement between ICE and the police department on June 30. It came after nearly three hours of public comment, with the vast majority of the public calling on the commission to stand by its vote to void an earlier agreement between the police chief and ICE.
The commission approved a second resolution expressing support for Haitians with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS protects immigrants from certain countries from deportation and allows them to work legally in the United States. However, Haitians in the United States will lose that protection as of Sept. 2, according to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. A spokesperson for DHS has said that the situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is “now safe for Haitian citizens to return home.” That measure passed, 5-1.
A third resolution calling on the city attorney to join in the legal action by the city of South Miami testing the legality of the requirement to enter into a 287(g) agreement was voted down, 4-2.
The vote rescinds earlier vote to void agreement
The immigration vote came eight days after Key West commissioners voted, 6-1, to void its police department’s previous 287(g) agreement with ICE that had been put into place by the city’s chief of police, Sean Brandenburg on March 4, with City Manager Brian Barroso’s knowledge but not with the approval of city commissioners.
In his July 2 letter, Uthmeier warned commissioners to “immediately” reverse last week’s vote.
“Failure to take corrective action will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution,” he wrote.
Members of the public spoke out against the proposed agreement, with many saying that it was worth taking a stand that could result in the loss of their jobs on the commission.
“I believe your stance against this evil spreading across our nation is exactly what you were called to do,” said resident Kirby Myers.
“Because 30 years from now, most of us will not be here. But our children will. And our grandchildren will. And when they look back at this night, it could be a defining moment in our history. They will either look back at our local leaders here tonight who had an opportunity to spread a light across this nation and create a model for others to follow, and fight. And stand. And look the bullies in the eye with unity and unwavering conviction. Or they’ll look back and recall a moment that faded, as we cowered in fear, and allowed those who rule by intimidation and violence to, once again, walk all over those without a voice.
“I know you are scared — scared to lose your positions. Scared of the retributions. Scared of the rhetoric and the hate being spread on social media and the vile attacks against our communities. But if you don’t take this stance tonight, who will?”
Commissioner Monica Haskell was not in town during the meeting, but participated via Zoom. Before public comment began, she blasted the mayor’s decision to hold the meeting without all members present.
“The city’s expert legal counsel has confirmed that we are in a strong position by doing nothing. We haven’t entered or supported an agreement. There’s no legal liability, so why panic? The mayor scheduled this meeting prior to discussing the legal options with the attorneys. Why not wait for the courts to decide whether the 287(g) agreement is mandatory or voluntary?
“Florida law does not require cities to sign 287(g). It only applies to sheriffs. Our police chief signed that agreement without public input or commission approval. That’s a problem. And we were right to recognize it as void. If the mayor’s resolution is approved, which I do not support to enter into the 287(g) agreement, then at least let’s fight in court alongside South Miami.
“But make no mistake, that entering into the 287(g) is the worst option for our community. Key West depends on tourism. We depend on trust. Turning our police into ICE agents erodes both. This isn’t about politics, it’s about public safety and economic survival.”
Commissioner Haskell proposed to postpone the decision until the city of South Miami’s legal challenge is adjudicated, but that amendment was rejected by the majority of the commission.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Nevadans can expect to see energy bills rise, gasoline costs creep upward, an increase in health risks, job losses, a plunge in the state’s gross domestic product, and the potential for a resurgence in nuclear energy as a result of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, industry experts are predicting. 
The OBBBA eliminates or phases out a number of clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and is expected to reduce investment in renewables.
“One of the bitter ironies of this bill is it’s been billed as something to lower costs for working Americans,” says Harrison Godfrey of Advanced Energy United, a trade group for clean energy interests. “It will absolutely raise costs on consumers, at the same time stripping away their ability to actually manage their own costs through distributed energy resources, energy efficiency and electric vehicles.”
As a result of Trump’s policy, Nevada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to “shrink by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.5 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $8 billion in Nevada,” according to a state-by-state analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. 
Nationally, Energy Innovation reports, the Act is expected to “cut GDP by $1.1 trillion, add $170 billion to household energy bills, and cut hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The OBBBA “claws back unobligated funding, expands new oil and gas leasing, changes or eliminates energy and manufacturing tax credits, and repeals some Clean Air Act programs.”
Electricity costs 
In Nevada, the OBBBA is expected to hike household energy spending by an average of more than $270 a year in 2030 and more than $500 a year in 2035, according to Energy Innovation’s report. “Statewide, households will foot nearly $4 billion in increased energy bills through 2035.” 
A separate analysis, Princeton’s REPEAT Project, estimates  energy costs for the average U.S. household will increase by about $165 dollars per household a year in 2030 and more than $280 dollars per household a year in 2035—an increase of about 7.5% in 2030 and more than 13% in 2035.
Tech, tariffs, and Trump cloud NV Energy effort to reduce carbon footprint 

The cost of a kilowatt hour for Nevada’s residential and commercial electric customers is expected to increase by 6.1% by next year, and by 6.6% by 2029, according to an analysis by the National Economic Research Associates (NERA), commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers of America. 
Nationally, electricity costs for commercial and residential users combined are projected to rise by 8.4%, with Wyoming residents and businesses expected to see the biggest increase of 29.2% by 2029, the NERA analysis estimates. 
Although the measure calls for ramped up domestic fuel production, increased energy demand “would raise prices more than increased domestic supply could lower them.” 
Under the OBBBA, recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program who receive energy assistance will be required to count the subsidy as income, unless the household includes an elderly or disabled person. 
Renewable projects and jobs
The bill Trump demanded that Congressional Republicans pass “drastically changes and terminates existing clean energy tax credits passed by Congress in 2022, which to date have generated $11.34 billion in new private-led investment across 45 domestic energy and manufacturing facilities in Nevada,” according to Energy Innovation. The measure threatens an additional $16.96 billion in private investment in 94 facilities planned throughout the state.
The OBBBA is expected to cut 6,200 jobs from Nevada’s workforce by 2030, and more than 8,300 jobs by 2035, “as new investment in domestic energy and manufacturing falters,” says Energy Innovation.
“This bill will kill projects and depress the addition of new energy supply at a time of rising demand, “ says Godfrey of Advanced Energy United.
Under the OBBBA, wind and solar projects placed in service after 2027 will not be eligible for the clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) and clean electricity production tax credit (PTC), unless they begin construction within a year of the OBBBA’s enactment on July 4. 
Climate activists warn that Trump’s energy policies have cost thousands of clean energy jobs

Of 63 new and proposed solar array projects listed on the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada’s website, 22 are scheduled to go into service after Trump’s Dec. 31, 2027 deadline, while another 41 projects have no in-service date scheduled. 
Projects in the early stages with no scheduled date to begin service are at risk of losing financial backing, says Godfrey, because of uncertainty about whether they’ll meet Trump’s deadline.
“And if they can’t say that they will with absolute certainty, the financial backing for those projects goes ‘poof,” Godfrey says, adding financiers “aren’t going to wait around to find out whether you can make it. They’re going to take their money elsewhere. That’s why the ‘place in service’ (provision) in this law will kill projects.” 
Endeavors that have begun construction and made a tangible investment “should have a four year runway to be placed into service and still be eligible for the tax credit,” Godfrey says. But he cautions the landscape under Trump is still shifting. 
In a signal that Trump is dissatisfied with Senate provisions that softened the OBBBA’s blow to solar and wind projects, the president on Monday issued an executive order which calls for the U.S. to “build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other ‘green’ energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.”
The provision could be at odds with Trump’s goal of keeping companies in the U.S., Godfrey says, as manufacturers encounter a shrinking market made more difficult to access under Trump’s policies, while a global market awaits. 
Trump, he says, “is undercutting his own policy on American global leadership and energy dominance and sparking debate among manufacturers. ‘Why stay here when I can go and serve the rest of the market abroad? I don’t know if the next factory I build will be in the U.S.’”
Other clean energy technologies, such as hydropower and geothermal, must begin construction by 2033 to qualify for the full tax credit, which begins to phase out in 2034.
“Making new clean electricity less economic will decrease new investment by utilities and independent power producers, threatening the ability to bring new capacity online in time to meet demand forecasts and significantly raising the costs to do so,” says Energy Innovation, which noted clean energy accounted for more than 90 percent of new capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2024. By contrast, gas turbine deliveries are backlogged until at least 2029. 
The OBBBA is projected to decrease cumulative new electricity capacity in Nevada by 0.7 gigawatts by 2030 and by 3.8 gigawatts by 2035. Nevada’s electric generating capacity was 16.72 gigawatts as of March, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Rooftop Solar: Not dead yet? 
Trump’s agenda “takes a sledgehammer to rooftop solar, and distributed energy broadly,” Godfrey says. The credit that has helped finance almost a third of the cost of rooftop solar systems expires at the end of the year under the OBBBA. 
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Nevadans claimed more than $137 million in credits for investments in residential electricity generation on their 2024 tax returns.
But rooftop solar isn’t dead, Godfrey says. Instead, it will find new ways to survive, such as leasing agreements “that can endure a little longer, despite some of the efforts of policymakers to gut those, too.” 
Electric vehicles and fuel prices 
The first apparent casualty of the OBBBA could be the electric vehicle market, as federal tax credits of $7,500 for buyers of new EVs and $4,000 for those who purchase used electric vehicles, expire on Sept. 30 of this year. Their termination could slow EV sales, especially among middle-income households, experts say. 
Trump’s bill also reduces the incentive for automakers to purchase electric vehicle credits from companies that produce a surplus of EVs, rendering the credits worthless, according to some.  
The OBBBA enacts a new tax credit that allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in loan interest from 2025 to 2028 on all vehicles assembled in the U.S., but the cost of powering combustion engines is expected to rise as the cost of gasoline is projected to increase by $.32 cents per gallon by 2035. 
“We find the average Nevada household will spend $170 more on annual vehicle fuel alone in 2030 and $350 annually in 2035,” says Energy Innovation’s analysis. 
While the Trump agenda bill preserves incentives for manufacturing EV batteries, “it destroys demand for them,” says Godfrey. 
In 2014, Nevada lawmakers approved a smorgasboard of incentives totalling some $1.3 billion for Tesla’s Gigafactory in Northern Nevada, which makes battery cells, and turns out semi-trucks. In 2023, the state forked over another $330 million in incentives for the plant’s expansion. 
Dirty air 
The bill’s provisions, combined with Trump’s executive actions, could lead to more than 7 billion tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, an about-face from clean energy momentum spurred by Biden-era policies. 
Air pollution, particularly from power plants and vehicles, is expected to worsen in  
Nevada. Annual emissions are expected to increase by more than 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of adding 430,000 cars to the road, according to Energy Innovation. That’s not including the impacts of other Trump policies, such as the repeal of Environmental Protection Agency rules regarding carbon emissions from power plants. 
Nuclear resurgence 
According to Stateline, in the last two years, around two dozen states have taken legislative action to promote nuclear power, including integrating it into long-term energy plans. 
“Certainly nuclear wound up with better treatment than wind and solar under this tax package. I would remain hopeful that we see continued innovation there, and ultimately deployment in the medium to long term,” said Godfrey of Advanced Energy United. 
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Two companies hold federal permits to build a modular reactor in the U.S.
Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation in April redefining nuclear energy as a “clean energy resource.” Future nuclear plants will be eligible to receive state grants previously reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
What’s next? 
As provisions of the OBBBA thwart investment and proliferation of clean energy products, state leaders “need to be committed to make sure these technologies are able to expand,” says Emilie Olson of Advanced Energy United. 
Toward that end, she says, leaders can embrace policies that enable residents to take advantage of virtual power plants and energy management systems that allow them to generate power from EV batteries, smart meters, and other technologies, and sell it back to the grid.  
“Those are things that state policymakers can stand up for and make happen, regardless of the whims of what’s happening on the Hill,” she said.
Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, the only member of the Nevada delegation to vote in favor of Trump’s bill, did not respond to requests for comment on the measure’s expected impacts in Nevada. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has embraced clean energy projects, including many made possible during the Biden era, also did not respond.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222867900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Even though home prices in Utah have grown less than 1% since 2022, Utah in 2024 ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the nation. 
Statewide, the median sales price of a single-family home hit $547,700 in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
That’s according to a new report published Tuesday, marking another yearly iteration of the “State of the State’s Housing Market” published by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
The report, written by Jim Wood, senior research fellow and one of the state’s leading housing market experts, paints the latest picture of Utah’s housing market for 2024. 
“High but stable housing prices” underscored Utah’s housing market that year, he wrote. “Stable prices, however, offered little relief to potential homebuyers as high interest rates and housing prices excluded many households from homeownership.” 
His big takeaway from last year? Utah’s housing marketplace — for both homebuyers and renters — is seeing a “correction” from the COVID-19 era, when low interest rates and new remote work opportunities sparked a homebuying spree, especially in the West. 
“We’re living in the shadow of that,” Wood told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Tuesday, adding that when prices skyrocket more than 40% in two years like they did from 2020 to 2022, some level of correction is “inevitable.”

But the housing market isn’t imploding like it after the 2008 bubble popped. What’s happening now isn’t as dramatic of a correction. Price increases have slowed — but they’re still every so slightly up. Home building and apartment construction has declined after a record home building boom in 2021. It’s all leveling off as interest rates remain high, squeezing affordability for homebuyers, renters and developers. 
“We haven’t seen housing prices go down substantially like some thought would occur,” Wood said. Yes, prices dipped slightly in 2023, he said, by less than 3%, but they came back up slightly in 2024. 
That 1% increase since 2022 reflects a “very stable” market, Wood said. 
“But we’re still (seeing), unfortunately, very high housing prices,” he said. Today’s high interest rates, hovering around 6.6%, combined with high prices, “introduces into this market a more extreme level of (lack of) affordability. … It’s still a huge issue.” 
In Utah’s five largest counties — Salt Lake, Weber, Davis, Utah and Washington — housing prices “are seriously to severely unaffordable,” when comparing median sales prices to median household income, Wood wrote in the report. 
Utah’s housing affordability level has only slightly improved from 2022, but not much. In 2022, the state’s “median multiple ratio” — which measures the severity of housing affordability by dividing the median sales price of a home by median household income — was a record 5.7, or “severely unaffordable,” according to the report. Last year, that dipped slightly to 5.1 after housing price growth leveled off, but a ratio of 5.1 is still considered “severely unaffordable.”

Consider that Utah’s median multiple ratio was 3.5 just over 10 years ago, in 2014. That ratio was considered “moderately unaffordable.” 
And while rental rates showed little to no change in 2024 (and even dipped in some areas), the average rental rate of all unit types in Salt Lake County increased from $1,582 a month in 2023 to $1,593 in 2024. That’s a less than 1% decrease — but came after rent prices jumped 20.7% in 2021. 
As for Utah’s housing shortage? It’s expected to persist since construction has contracted. About 22,000 residential units were permitted in 2024, the lowest number since 2016, according to the report. 
“A drop in apartment development accounted for 90% of this decline,” Wood wrote, noting that apartment unit permits fell from 7,622 in 2023 to 4,801 in 2024 — which he described as “the lowest level since the Great Recession.”  
However, that’s after the “apartment development boom peaked in 2021, at 14,143 units, leading to an overbuilt market with higher vacancy rates and, in some cases, lower rents,” he wrote. 
Today, Salt Lake County has a rental inventory of 160,000 units. Only 1,283 apartment units were permitted in 2024 in that county, making up less than 1% of its inventory. That’s not on pace with 3% growth, so inventory continues to pace behind demand. 
“We probably need at least 4,000 or 5,000 (units) if we have consistent growth in our net immigration and kids going from living with their parents and form households,” Wood said. 
Housing affordability could be impacting Utah’s growth
With supply continuing to pace behind projected demand, Wood predicted Utah will continue to face high prices and a limited inventory. 
“To get an equilibrium, good balance is really tough,” he said. “We’re in a period right now where we had a ton of supply, so the builders cut it off, we got no supply, demand continues to grow, and then by the time the supply is induced, you know it’s a year or two too late so we have a tight market.” 
However, Wood noted Utah is feeling the impacts of its housing affordability issues. 
“Utah’s growth is slowing down. Employment growth and demographic growth are both just drifting lower and lower,” he said. Last month, Utah’s job growth increased an estimated 2.5% year over year, down from more than 3% job growth in 2019, according to state estimates.

Combined with other factors including slowing population growth, Wood said that and demand for lower-priced homes like apartments, townhomes and condominiums show that the state’s housing affordability issues could be having a real impact on its growth. 
“Now the question is, why? Why is employment growth slowing down in Utah? A couple of us here at the institute, we’ve discussed that, and we think it has a lot to do with housing prices,” he said. 
Anecdotally, Wood said he personally knows of people who have quit their jobs and moved out of the state in search of lower-priced homes. 
“We’ve got more people leaving than we’ve had years past because they couldn’t get into the housing market, or they wanted a bigger home and it was too expensive here,” he said. “So we’re probably losing people that we didn’t years ago, and we’re not getting as many coming because of high housing prices.” 
Where do we go from here?
Wood said that economic uncertainty and slower rates of population and economic growth will likely put a damper on housing demand in 2025. He also expects residential construction, existing home sales, housing prices and mortgage rates will continue to linger around the same levels as last year.

Wood forecasted the median sales price of a single-family home to grow only slightly, by 2%, to $558,000, and the median price of a condo, townhome and twin home will go up 3% to $422,000. 
He also expects affordability to remain a stark issue, with interest rates projected to stay between 6% and 7%. 
Though President Donald Trump has been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates drastically, it remains to be seen what will actually happen later this year and in coming years. But if interest rates do come down, say below 6%, “then you’d have a different landscape,” Wood said. 
Home prices would likely increase, along with home building and real estate sales, he said. But low rates could also lead to inflation issues, like what happened after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But based on the current landscape, Wood expects Utah to remain in a real estate holding pattern over the next year or so. Expect to continue to see high prices and high rates.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by  President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”



For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

A mass shooting in Birmingham last September helped lead to a statewide ban on glock switches, which turn semi-automatic firearms into effectively automatic ones. Crime is looming as an issue in the coming mayoral elections in Birmingham. (John Coletti/The Image Bank)This story was produced in collaboration with Birmingham Watch, a nonprofit news site.  Support them here. 
The hustle and bustle of the Five Points South neighborhood belies its recent history, including a mass shooting in which four people were killed in September.
But businesses in Birmingham have felt the ripple effects of gun violence. Following the mass shooting at Hush Hookah/Cigar Lounge, several businesses, including Hush and Sleek Sports Bar, have closed their doors and new businesses have moved in to the Five Points South area.
Lindsay Garrett, a Birmingham native and marketing director for Opulence Drag Lounge & Taqueria in Five Points South, which moved into Hush’s old location, said they aim to distance themselves from the tragic event that took place last year.
“People who are here are creating something (that has) nothing to do with what occurred here previously,” she said. “Violence happens all over the city, all over the state, no matter what community you’re in, whether it be Black, white, LGBTQ or otherwise, there is violence happening in all aspects of the city. So we’re trying not to focus on that,” she said.
The shooting helped lead to the passage of the first state law restricting firearms in about 15 years. In March, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 116, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road. The law imposes a state ban on “Glock switches,” or devices that turn semi-automatic handguns like pistols into fully automatic weapons, which were used in September’s shooting.
Gun violence is a problem throughout the nation. Last year, the John Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions reported firearms remain the leading cause of death in children and teens with Black youth being some of the most affected by gun violence.
“In 2022, in the 1 to 17 age group, Black children and teens had a gun death rate 18 times higher than that of white children in the same age group. The gun homicide rate among Black children and teens rose 5.6 percent from 2021 to 2022,” The report said.
Glock switches have been used throughout Alabama, which has the fourth-highest rate of death from firearms in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But Birmingham has suffered significantly from gun violence, and crime is a major issue in elections this year. The Birmingham Police Department reported 151 homicides in 2024, a rate of about 76.9 homicides per 100,000 people in the city.

By comparison, Huntsville, a city with about 35,000 more residents, reported 18 homicides in 2024, a rate of 7.8 per 100,000. Mobile reported 37 homicides, a rate of 18.3 per 100,000, and Montgomery reported 61, or 31.2 per 100,000.
This year through the end of June, Birmingham has reported 37 homicides, which is a reduction from this time last year of more than 51%.
Mayor Randall Woodfin, who is seeking reelection this year, has been advocating against reducing gun violence in Birmingham.
“I care about decreasing gun violence in our city. I care about decreasing crime, I care about saving lives,” he said in a 30-minute video in November.
A commission appointed by the mayor also issued a 66-page report in January detailing plans to reduce gun violence and homicides. The plan included immediate actions to take including:

Focused deterrence, a strategy targeting high-risk individuals and groups through a combination of enforcement, accountability and social support.
Community violence intervention, which would expand street outreach and hospital-based violence intervention programs to disrupt cycles of violence and retaliation.
Shooting reviews to provide ongoing analysis of violent incidents to identify patterns, prevent retaliation, and guide future interventions.
Focus on hotspots, designed to address concentrated areas of violence in the community through strategies ranging from additional policing to blight reduction and neighborhood revitalization.

Woodfin has said the city has made substantial progress on several of those fronts.
Crime remains one of the focal issues in the mayor’s race. U.S. Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, kicked off the political season on New Year’s Day with her announcement for the office and pledge to focus on community safety.
Mayoral candidate Brian K. Rice said in a statement in response to questions that he favors crime prevention as the first step to keep Iron City residents out of incarceration.
“My primary focus is on crime prevention, enabling us to enhance both the mind and the built environment,” the statement said. “Every day we fail to improve the built environment and improve the minds of our most challenged, where hurt and trauma rule, then we are preparing for more convictions. We must alter the destructive path before the next law is broken. I am committed to routing resources as the budget allows to protect the public safety of all under my watch. I am concerned about the human before they breach any gun law.”
Kamau Afrika, another mayoral candidate, said the new law has come later than it should have and said now almost anyone can get a gun. Afrika said that to limit gun violence, he would expand Birmingham’s city jail into the Southside area, and he would place those incarcerated into mentorship programs. An advocate for crime reduction, he said he would place youths in mentorship programs, implement a patrol force with a focus on community policing and construct athletic complexes for youth to engage.
Lashunda Scales has taken a tough on crime stance and pledged to enable police, including getting the police force up to full staffing.
Frank Woodson has said his focus would be on community building to ensure safe neighborhoods. And Jerimy Littlepage has said he wants to fight crime by helping lift up youth before they turn to crime.
Garrett said the city and the residents have different opinions on how to handle gun violence.
“I don’t see the measures that are being taken being as effective as the city would like them to be. And I do believe that there is a bit of a mismatch between what the city thinks should be done and what the community needs. And if the city itself would really speak and go into the communities and talk to the people, they would probably find more efficient and effective solutions.”
Action after a shooting
There’s no rush to ban guns in Alabama. The Glock switch ban was spurred on in part by the Five Points and other mass shootings in the Birmingham area where people died under automatic fire.
Glock switches can be easily obtained and installed on firearms, said Matthew Valasik, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Alabama.
“People can or end up manufacturing these things and selling them online relatively easily. So it’s not super complicated to procure one of these items,” he said.
Glock switches are already outlawed at the federal level. But Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, who has sought a state ban on Glock switches for years, said this ban will help save lives by making it easier for local law enforcement to confiscate the devices.
“A ban will allow law enforcement to confiscate a device before it could be used, and that is a matter of saving people’s lives and preventing a horrible shooting, and particularly a mass shooting, so to have it go into effect immediately, can save lives and prevent some of the deadliest and most horrific shootings that have occurred and can occur,” Ensler said.
Ensler, who had been pushing for a similar law, said his experience as a teacher who has lost students to gun violence and an encounter with a mother made him determined to have something comparable passed.
“Legislatively, what really got me even more involved in it was, a mother in my district came up to me after a neighborhood meeting and shared the story of her son dying from a gun that had a Glock switch,” he said. “And she said that she knows that no law can bring her son back, but that if a law can help save lives moving forward, she asked that I would fight for that.”
Representatives for Slide Cafe, which is directly above Opulence, said in a statement that they support the new law and all efforts to make Alabama safer.
“At this time we are happy to express our support in efforts to make all of Alabama a safer place through the Glock switch ban,” the statement said.
Just because there is now a ban on Glock switches doesn’t mean crime in Alabama will stop.
“If you’re going to be involved in a crime, I don’t know how much it’s going to actually impact you. It might prevent people that are thinking about ordering it, obviously that may deter you if there’s some type of investigation into a person that’s selling these things and tracking who they’re selling them to, or where they’re going to, and then you’re arresting people for possessing it,” Valasik said.
Garrett also said Opulence hopes the Birmingham community will get what it needs out of the new law.
“We hope that the community gets what it needs out of the Glock switch ban. We hope that there is less violence than, specifically less gun violence, obviously. And if this is going to initiate less gun violence, I hope that’s what happens. And that the effect of that lessening of gun violence isn’t further oppression of minority communities,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Birmingham-Alabama-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

(Courtesy of South Dakota State Historical Society)The following excerpt is from the new book “Wilder Weather,” which is available from the South Dakota Historical Society Press.
As railroads extended into Dakota Territory from the late 1870s to mid-1880s and the Homestead Act provided land, the settler population surged in a period dubbed the “Great Dakota Boom.” The population increased across Dakota Territory from just over 98,000 in 1880 to 348,600 in 1890. Economic fortunes were tied closely to the success of agriculture and ranching, from the growing stages using the Homestead Act plots of land to the shipment of goods via the railroad network. Little did the settlers know how good they had it, how flush with rain they were. Homesteaders had unknowingly arrived on the Plains during a relatively wet (or “pluvial”) period. Rain had not followed the plow; the plow had followed the rain. Homesteaders plowed up the prairie and planted crops with the mistaken impression that enough rain would continue to fall to support the acreage they tilled.
Then the pendulum swung, passing right through the “normal” middle-of-the-road rainfall and far into the dry side. To the homesteaders, the lack of rain must have felt as jarring as shifting from fifth gear to first in an old pickup truck. They were new to the Dakota climate still, not yet aware of how wide the swings could be between wet periods and dry. The skies and soils dried out just as the newly married Wilders began their farming years in the mid- to late 1880s, adding layers of difficulty from the very beginning of their years together. Laura had promised Almanzo just three years to give farming a try, and the drought sunk in its teeth by the end of their third year of marriage in 1888.


About the book
  The cover of Barbara Boustead’s book, “Wilder Weather,” published by the South Dakota Historical Society Press.
This excerpt is reprinted with permission from the new book “Wilder Weather: What Laura Ingalls Wilder Teaches Us About the Weather, Climate, and Protecting What We Cherish,” by meteorologist, climatologist and Wilder scholar Barbara Boustead, Ph.D. The book is available from the South Dakota Historical Society Press.


As in the 1870s during Wilder’s Plum Creek days, a La Niña pattern established itself in the distant equatorial Pacific Ocean in the late 1880s through the late 1890s, dominating global weather patterns for nearly a decade. Recall that in the United States, La Niña patterns favor dry conditions in the southern Great Plains, often spreading northward into the central Great Plains when La Niña continues for multiple years. La Niña conditions occurred in 1886-1887, 1889-1890, and 1892-1895. The La Niñas of the 1890s were stronger and more consecutive than those of the 1870s, which can strengthen the downstream impacts. While not the only contributing factor, the persistent La Niña-like pattern was a significant driver of the dry weather patterns affecting wide swaths of the central United States.
In Huron, South Dakota, the driest summer on record (stretching back to 1881) remains the summer of 1894. The summer of 1893 ranks as eleventh driest and 1889 as seventeenth driest. In Huron, the dryness of the late 1880s through the mid-1890s was just about as profound as the 1930s “Dust Bowl” years. The temperatures for all three of those years (1889, 1893, and 1894) were above average, too, compared to an 1881-1910 average. In fact, the summertime average temperature in 1894 was the warmest on record until 1921, on level with the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, and still ranks well above normal even including the warmer recent decades in the full record. Put a different way, the heat of the late 1880s to mid-1890s was roughly a once-in-a-generation event at the time, though it has become more of an every-other-year occasion in our modern climate.
The dry summers of the late 1880s into the 1890s were too much to take for many would-be farmers, and the settlers who were still so new to the land abandoned it in droves. The bust years peaked in the early to mid-1890s as relentless drought conditions caused crop failures year after year. Combined with factors such as lack of federal and state support for government relief for the farmers and a broader economic depression in the United States, drought was key to ending the boom of population expansion in the Dakotas. Emigration from the Dakotas in the early 1890s caused a net loss in population from 348,600 in 1890 to 331,000 by 1895.
The Wilders and their young daughter, Rose, were one of the families driven from their homestead by drought. Leaving De Smet in 1890, they moved in with Almanzo Wilder’s parents in Spring Valley, Minnesota, for a year to find respite, and then to Westville, Florida, in search of opportunity. Disappointed there, the family returned to De Smet in 1892. They lived in town as Laura worked as a seamstress and Almanzo worked varying jobs, saving money so the family could resettle for good. The Wilders made no attempt to farm when they returned to De Smet, paralleling the Ingalls family experience of Wilder’s childhood, in which they lived in town and did not farm when they returned to Walnut Grove after their unsuccessful year in Burr Oak, Iowa.
Charmed by a pamphlet advertising life in the Ozarks, the Wilder family made the decision to move to Missouri in 1894, at the climax of the drought. In an introduction to her mother’s published travel journal, On the Way Home, Rose Wilder Lane later penned the conditions she had observed when they departed De Smet for good: “For seven years there had been too little rain. The prairies were dust. Day after day, summer after summer, the scorching winds blew the dust and the sun was brassy in a yellow sky. Crop after crop failed. Again and again the barren land had to be mortgaged, for taxes and food and next year’s seed. The agony of hope ended when there was no harvest and no more credit, no money to pay interest and taxes; the banker took the land. Then the bank failed.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As if to prove the difficulty of preparing for the unforeseen, the organizer of a recent prepper convention wasn’t ready for a heat wave that socked his gathering. 
Troy McKinley, the organizer of the 3rd Annual Minnesota Prepper Expo, wore a t-shirt that read, “Noah was a conspiracy theorist … then it rained” — in reference to the famous boat builder. 
He acknowledged the heat probably kept people away from the Morrison County Fairgrounds on a recent blistering 90 degree Saturday that had driven most Minnesotans indoors. 
McKinley hoped for 1,000 attendees at the prepper fair, but there were less than 100 in attendance on the convention’s second day. 
Still, a handful had pitched tents for the three-day event, and all signs point to a continued robust obsession with preparing for the American end: People shell out money to share in stories about the apocalypse. The causes are as diverse as their creators: cordiceps (“The Last of Us”); artificial intelligence (“The Terminator”); nuclear holocaust; solar storms; or, a global pandemic.
The end’s hold on humanity — and, it seems, Americans in particular — comprises art and entertainment, as well as the theological and political, with some Christians reading events in modern Israel as precursors to the “rapture,” while others once strained to see the anti-Christ in Barack Obama. 
McKinley might have given the impression of a religious man, but as the self-described agnostic reflected on his upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, he said, “I had questions that they couldn’t answer.”
These days, McKinley, who once watched panicked oil workers loot a grocery store during a North Dakota snowstorm, has found community among preppers — like-minded people who make preparations for disaster scenarios.  
Preppers, sometimes called “doomsday preppers,” tend to conjure images of underground bunkers and zombie apocalypses. The expo leaned into this idea, its logo featuring silhouettes of zombies and bullet holes.

But most people gathered at the event — many hesitant to label themselves as preppers — were most concerned with technological or electric grid interruption or collapse, civil unrest or another pandemic, with memories of COVID-19’s run on toilet paper and cleaning supplies. 
Jake Sparrow, who was selling his up-cycled clothing at the event, said he loved “The Walking Dead” but didn’t find it realistic.  
Sparrow said his primary concern is EMPs, or electromagnetic pulses, that can result from natural events like solar storms or manmade nuclear detonation. EMPs cause voltage surges that can damage electronic equipment. Though widespread technological collapse due to nuclear detonation is unlikely, solar storms, though rare, do pose a concern for communications infrastructure. It was a common subject of conversation at the convention, with frequent references to the so-called Carrington Event, when a solar storm in 1859 caused telegraph systems to go haywire. 
Sparrow suspects the government might produce an EMP while blaming it on a solar flare. 
Rather than stockpiling resources, Sparrow said his focus is on refining skills like gardening, carpentry and bushcraft. He almost never carries a cell phone but does have a collection of weapons. 
“I guess I’m not concerned, but I’m almost expecting it,” Sparrow said of an electric grid collapse. 
Sparrow’s wife, Amanda joked, “When’s it gonna happen? Let’s just get on with this already.”

Many of the people at the convention, however, were less concerned with the end than with their atrophied survival skills, seeking sustainability in an increasingly technology-dependent world. Most of the presentations given by speakers — ranging from seed-saving to preserving food with salt — would’ve been equally relevant to homesteaders as those preparing for a life-altering catastrophe. 
In a seminar about child-rearing in the wilderness, Elli King-Gallager said that the way she is raising her children – in the wilderness, with very limited technology – feels radical at first. “But it’s not radical at all,” she said. “All we’re really doing is living the way people were living 200 years ago. It’s not that big of a deal. It’s not that amazing.”

A dozen people sat in a semicircle of folded chairs to hear Mike Bollinger, the executive director of Seed Savers Exchange, speak about preserving seeds. 
Bollinger leads the largest nongovernmental seed bank in the U.S. The federal government’s much larger equivalent, known as the National Plant Germplasm System, was in flux earlier this year when the Department of Government Efficiency fired some of its employees (they were later reinstated). 
Though Bollinger was unfamiliar with the prepper oeuvre, he drove from Iowa to give a talk at the event after the expo reached out to him. 
He said demand for seeds went up 70% during COVID-19, the world-rattling event that caused many to think perhaps preppers were right to be concerned about the fragility of society’s systems. 
“I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm around gardening and food production, but there’s a huge gap, I think, when it comes to just functional seed-saving skill,” Bollinger said.  
A growing industry with long-term roots 
Prepping isn’t a new phenomenon. The modern incarnation originated in the 1950s, in part due to Cold War-era anxieties over nuclear warfare. The early manifestation of preppers — known as “retreaters” — stressed individualism and fleeing off-grid for survival purposes. 
Global catastrophes like COVID-19 and climate change-related natural disasters are fueling a growing number of modern preppers, including left-leaning survivalists. “Bug out” bags — backpacks filled with emergency survival supplies — are sold by online survival retailers for hundreds of dollars.

By some estimates, there are more than 20 million preppers in the U.S., defined as people who would be able to survive for at least 31 days at home without utilities or outside support. This is compared to a total of 7 million in 2018. 
Estimating the number of preppers can be difficult, especially because there’s no universal definition of what it means to be a prepper. Not everyone who makes small-scale disaster preparations — like storing blankets in the car in case of a snowstorm — would consider themselves preppers. 
The term tends to raise eyebrows. 
Margaret Engstrom, a first-time attendee of the convention, spoke about the stigma associated with the label. Engstrom said she had been interested in prepping for decades but wouldn’t describe herself as “hardcore.”
“I don’t think of myself as a nut job. I think of myself as alternative and prepared,” Engstrom said. 
As the number of preppers has grown, so has the survival tools market. A 2023 report from Zion Market Research projected that the industry would grow to $2.46 billion by 2030. Prepper conventions and expos like McKinley’s have been popping up around the country. PrepperShowsUSA, a website dedicated to advertising these events, lists several events per month across the country. 
McKinley is in the process of organizing his first prepper expo in Colorado, to take place in October.

What will save us? Community.  
In one of the fairground’s large, open air buildings, a colorful “Poultry and Rabbits” sign hung over the entrance. Vendors stood among tables lined with damascus steel knives, 3D printed gun holsters, apocalypse books and herbal remedies. 
Francis Majeski sat making cordage, a string made of natural fibers as a large fan next to him hummed. On his table, with bone needles and lyre lucets used for braiding, was a copy of “Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West,” which is about the western explorer who was the first white man to cross the Sierra Nevada, and is said to have drawn the map of the American West on a beaver skin.

Majeski didn’t identify strongly with the term “prepper.”  
“[I’m] not so much a survivalist as I practice the second-greatest commandment, love your neighbor as yourself,” Majeski said. 
In contrast to the typical image of the hyper-individualist, solitary prepper — consider the Nick Offerman character in “The Last of Us” — Majeski said community, not individualism, would be the ultimate key to survival in a disaster scenario. That’s why he makes an effort to reach out to others. 
“I get to know my neighbor across the street, even though his son ran their car into my garage,” Majeski joked. 
Majeski described himself as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump but disagrees with many of his policies. He also rejected some of the ideas that seem to permeate prepper culture. 
Though Majeski plans to be more independent should anything happen — he now makes his own boot laces — he said there are limits. 
“We like to, in our arrogance, believe that we are going to be ready for everything. You’re not,” Majeski said.  
Still, mainstream prepper culture often emphasizes rugged individualism, touting guns and masculine portrayals harkening back to the ideals of westward expansion. In her book “American Apocalyptic,” Georgia College & State University professor and “liberal prepper” Juli Gittinger writes about the role that the American frontier myth still plays among many preppers. 
“Echoes of the frontier motif have been used repeatedly throughout the American political landscape, from Kennedy’s ‘New Frontier’ to Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ — an imagined reality where rugged individualism and self-reliance can overcome any obstacle (notably, non-white people who interfere with the divine providence of American destiny)…The frontier myth cultivates a particular brand of masculinity that intersects with the discourse on firearm ownership, survivalist/prepper cultures, ‘traditional’ (read: heteronormative) models of the family, and white superiority,” Gittinger writes in “American Apocalyptic.”

While these sentiments were not entirely absent from those at the convention, they also weren’t dominating the conversation. 
McKinley said that his goal with the expo is to foster community between preppers: “I hope that they’re connecting with each other, meeting other like-minded people, and learning to work together on things instead of going after each other,” he said. 
He reached out to many of the speakers and vendors personally. Amanda and Jake Sparrow got an invite after running into McKinley at a farmers market in Little Falls. 
The schedule of speakers included a note about inclusivity at the event: “Hate speech, bullying, or degrading comments referring to topics such as political affiliation, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will NOT be tolerated.”
McKinley’s experience with disaster response is almost pedestrian: He was in North Dakota when high winds during a winter storm knocked down the power lines. The oil wildcatters who had recently moved to the area to open an oil field were not ready for it. 
“These young guys, they’ve never seen anything like that before, and they panicked. They broke the windows out of the two main grocery stores. They cleared the shelves off of bottled water and canned goods and stuff like that,” McKinley said.  
Since then, McKinley has been ensuring he has extra groceries and generators. His primary concerns when it comes to disasters are solar flares, electromagnetic eruptions from the sun, and pole reversals, which is when Earth’s magnetic north and south poles flip, which happens an average of every 300,000 years. 
McKinley was clear to say that he’s “not a gun collector,” though he does own guns.  
“My weapons all have a purpose, you know, and so I don’t have a lot of them,” McKinley said.

Vance Boelter, suspected assassin, described as a prepper   
Prepping caught national headlines at the end of June, when a court filing described suspected assassin Vance Boelter and his wife as preppers. Boelter is accused of killing Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. 
Boelter owned dozens of guns and had made a “bailout plan” for his family that included going to Jenny Boelter’s mother’s house in Wisconsin. The morning of the assassination, Boelter texted his family, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.” 
The affidavit didn’t include many details about Boelter’s prepping, and Boelter didn’t feature in conversations at the convention. 
Boelter’s roommate, David Carlson, told the Star Tribune that the prepper label fit Boelter but he was uncertain how involved in prepping Boelter actually was. 
“He always thought there would be civil war or the government would fall,” Carlson said. “I knew he had some firearms or food, maybe. I only thought he had like five or 10 guns. I was shocked to find out he had so many.”

As the second day of the expo wound down, attendance thinned and vendors began packing up. A few speakers and attendees gathered around a campfire as the sun set over rows of trailers. The expo would go on for one more day. 
The following Wednesday, the Morrison County Fair was starting. 
Some of the game operators were already up and running in the hopes of drumming up business from the expo. 
A few stragglers tried their luck at a toy gun game, the targets swapped out with pictures of zombies, and it was easy to conclude that they were probably not ready for the end.

Satchel Paige became the first Black pitcher in American League history. 
His debut had been long anticipated, because he was already making headlines as a Negro Leagues pitcher, and sportswriters loved to quote him. Major League Baseball wrote of him, “Paige was baseball’s Mark Twain, but with a much better fastball.” Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio and Dizzy Dean all called him the best pitcher they had ever seen. 
Paige was born in 1906 in Mobile, Alabama. At age 13, he was caught trying to shoplift, and he spent the next five years at reform school. While there, his coach Edward Byrd taught him to pitch. He went on to pitch for the Negro Leagues as well as leagues in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Mexico. By 1948, most people thought Paige was too old to pitch in Major League Baseball. He was already 42. 
“Age is a case of mind over matter,” he told reporters. “If you don’t mind, it don’t matter.” 
Then the Cleveland Indians signed him. He started out as a relief pitcher and made his first start on Aug. 13, 1948, where he threw a five-hit shutout in front of more than 50,000 fans, putting Cleveland back in first place. He helped Cleveland win the pennant and the World Series, ending the year with a 6-1 record with a 2.48 ERA and two shutouts. The Sporting News named him Rookie of the Year. 
Paige continued to pitch well into his 50s, retiring in 1953 — only to return in 1965 to pitch three innings for the Kansas City A’s. He faced 10 batters, “relaxing” in a rocking chair between innings. After allowing a first-inning double, he retired the Red Sox in the second and third innings. He was 59 at the time, making him the oldest player in Major League history. 
In 1971, he became the first Negro League veteran to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, The Sporting News ranked him No. 19 among the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

,California,2025-07-09 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s South Carolina visit should remove any doubts about his political goals,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/newsom-south-carolina-presidential-run/,South Carolina could host the first presidential primary again in 2028. Democratic politicians who see themselves as potential candidates are finding reasons to visit. Gavin Newsom went there this week.,"If anyone still harbors doubts that Gavin Newsom is contemplating a run for the White House in 2028, this week’s sojourn into South Carolina for some schmoozing with local politicians and photo ops with common folk should dispel them.
Although South Carolina is strongly Republican state, in 2024 the Democratic Party, at the behest of then-President Joe Biden, designated it as the first state to have a presidential primary. It could play that role again in 2028.
Thus, Democratic politicians who see themselves as potential candidates are — to no one’s surprise — finding reasons to visit the state. Newsom’s rationale is that he wants to know how cuts in federal health care programs are affecting South Carolinians.
Ever since winning a second and final term as governor three years ago, Newsom has obviously been building a national profile, all the while insisting that he had no presidential ambitions.
However, after spending half of his 57 years climbing the political ladder one rung at a time, it seemed unlikely that he would simply retire from politics after his governorship ended and return to running his wine and hospitality business.
Last month, Newsom acknowledged the possibility of a 2028 run in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, saying “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.” This week’s visit to South Carolina proves that he’s headed down that path.
Could Newsom pull it off?
When Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump last year, it opened the door for all Democratic hopefuls. The party is undergoing a post-election upheaval after losing not only the presidency but control of both houses of Congress.
There’s a sense that the nation’s voters are not buying what the party has been selling, but there’s no consensus on how it should change to win back disaffected voter blocs, nor is there a commanding figure to lead its transformation.
Newsom has been a vocal critic of the party’s failure to connect with blue-collar voters, particularly young men, but has yet to articulate an alternative approach. He’s also been slowly edging away from his previous image as a California progressive — much to the dismay of environmentalists, gay and transgender rights advocates and other left-leaning groups.
The lack of an obvious leader in what could be a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls creates an opening for Newsom to offer himself as someone who could put together a coalition of voter blocs capable of defeating the 2028 Republican candidate — most likely, at this early stage, Vice President JD Vance.
Early polling does place Newsom among the upper tier of potential Democratic candidates, although with barely double-digit support. Nevertheless, Newsom’s path to the White House — or at least to the Democratic nomination — is also filled with potholes, beginning with the inescapable fact that he’s from California.
The state’s image these days is a far cry from the land of sunshine and opportunity that it once enjoyed. Its chronic housing shortage, its squalid encampments of homeless people in the state’s major cities and its self-designation as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants are potent campaign fodder for Newsom’s rivals — and his Republican opponent, should he win the nomination.
To many, Newsom also comes across as slick and glib rather than sincere, someone who bends reality to portray California and himself as leaders to be emulated. If Newsom is to become acceptable to South Carolinians and other voters across the nation, he will have to persuade them that his eight years as governor of California has earned him a promotion to the top rung on the ladder. 
That won’t be easy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070825-Newsom-South-Carolina-MK-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

All but two areas improved over last year.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The number of Alabama elementary and middle school students scoring below proficient dropped in most subjects on the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) test, according to data released Tuesday by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE).
The test results for the 2024-25 school year are split between four levels where level three and four are considered proficient. State Superintendent Eric Mackey said the number of students scoring below those levels dropped for every subject area except eighth-grade math. 
“Across the board in English language arts … we saw a reduction in level one and level two. Those are students below proficiency in pretty much every grade across the board,” Mackey told reporters after the State Board of Education meeting. “What it means is all those students are moving to proficiency levels. I was very excited to see that in level one, our lowest performance level, in every grade we saw fewer students than 2024.”
Public school students from second to eighth grade took the test last year. The scores released Tuesday reflect overall statewide performance. District and school-level data will be available in August. 
The English language arts test includes reading, in which second and third graders improved, but also reading comprehension and grammar, Mackey said.
The only stagnant data in proficiency was in seventh grade math and fourth grade science. In 2024, 38% of seventh graders scored in level one, which improved to 32% this year. However, Mackey said that not enough students were moving from level two to level three. The same percentage of seventh graders scored in level two in 2024 as there were in level one, but only 44% of students were in level two this year. Levels three and four were the same over the two years. For the fourth grade science scores, there were increases and decreases in each level, which evened out to 43% of fourth graders being proficient in science.
“We saw essentially the same thing in math with one little glitch in seventh grade that we’re still kind of worried about,” he said. “We’re still looking at that. It appears to be an alignment in curriculum issue because we see a rebound a little bit in eighth grade and high school.”
About 24% of seventh graders were proficient in math this year, largely unchanged from the 2023-24 school year. Eighth graders were 25% proficient in math, a 3% improvement over 2023-24, according to the data. 
Where 60% of second graders are proficient in ELA, 46% are proficient in math. Across all three subject areas, proficiency starts to drop in the sixth grade. 
Seventh and eighth grade students’ scores in math are lower than the other grades, which Mackey said is due in part to these students opting out of the required curriculum to take a higher level math. 
“Seventh and eighth grade math has always been an anomaly,” he said. “I’m worried about this, but it’s not my greatest worry because middle school math is complex for the whole country right now. There’s a serious drop for a lot of reasons, and part of it is screen time.”
But Mackey said he believes students are in a good spot. 
“This means we are pushing students to higher achievement across the state in every grade,” Mackey said.

ELL students proficient in English

According to data from the department, Alabama schools had over 50,000 students whose first language is not English. Of those, 2,670 (5.29%) tested in 2025 as proficient in the English language, an increase of about 0.7% over the 2023-24 school year. Mackey predicted that there would be 55,000 ELL students by next years’ data release.
“We have to remember that not all are coming to us at first grade, they’re coming to us all from all grades,” Alabama State Board of Education President Pro Tempore Kelly Mooney said.
If a student scores well enough on the test, they no longer require support service, but Mackey said the support is still available to them
“It takes most students way more than one or two years to read and write English proficiently to exit,” he said. “A lot of them are coming to us and they have had no or almost no formal schooling where they came from.”
High school testing
Mackey also said the state average on the ACT, the standardized test for college admissions, was 17.3 in 2024-25, down slightly from the 17.4 in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years. The highest possible score on the ACT is a 36.
Currently the state administers the ACT test with the writing section to 11th graders, but it is an optional test. Mackey said making it optional, and having more options for a student to demonstrate college and career readiness, discourages students from performing well on the ACT test. 
“If a student is not going to college and their ACT scores aren’t going to count on their A through F report card, they may not go in there and try very hard,” Mackey said. “ And this, this number may continue to decline no matter what we do, because it’s not an accurate description of our college bound students.” 
Mackey suggested that the board revisit how high schoolers are tested, because the current model does not accurately reflect high schoolers, especially those intending to go to college.
“For accountability, we might move to a different kind of test,” Mackey said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9624-e1752006841809-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

Criminal justice reform groups have asked the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to put more weight into a parole applicant's rehabilitative efforts than the severity of their crime in considering parole guidelines. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Several criminal justice reform organizations want new parole guidelines under consideration by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to use a scoring system that puts more weight into an applicant’s rehabilitation efforts than the original crime.
The proposed guidelines, made available to the public in the latter part of May after years of delays, would guide the board’s decision in determining an applicant’s fitness for parole.
“The modifications that we suggest are more in line with a parole board that is trying to accomplish the mission of reintegrating people who are ready to get back into society and rebuild their lives,” said Dev Wakeley, a policy advocate with Alabama Arise who provided input regarding the comments. “We all know that the parole board has had major issues over the last several years particularly, and we want to make sure the updated guidelines become a way to make positive changes instead of paper over the real problems that we have seen.”
The guidelines — which are not binding on the board’s parole decisions — operate on a point system in which more points mean less likelihood of a parole applicant getting parole. Those who receive at least 9 points based on the proposed updated guidelines are recommended to be denied parole.
Some sections of the parole guidelines remained the same, while others were changed in a manner that further limits the potential for applicants to be granted parole.
The proposed guidelines recommend issuing points based on the severity of the offense, with one point for less-severe ones and four points for those that are “very high.” The current point system has three categories, with offenses that are low severity given zero points while those that are considered the most severe are assigned two points.
The proposed guidelines do not issue any points for people without any discipline issues within the past year, but impose a five-point penalty if the applicant had two or more disciplinaries that included violence in the past 12 months.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama Arise, and the ACLU of Alabama collaborated on a single review while staff from Alabama Appleseed submitted their comments separately. Both groups proposed reducing points for specific sections, including the severity of the original offense.
SPLC and ACLU of Alabama recommended that offenses with low severity not be given any weight while the most severe crimes are designated two points.
“The parole hearing application process is not a forum to relitigate the underlying offense — the sentence the applicant is currently serving,” the groups wrote in their submission. “The process is meant to assess and determine the individual’s ‘status’ of rehabilitation. That said, ‘low’ offense severity has been shown to be a statistically significant positive indicator of fitness for release and accordingly should not result in a negative consequence for petitioners.”
Alabama Appleseed recommended that the parole board return to the previous scoring system that considers the severity of the offense.
“Our experience in Alabama backs up what the research shows: conviction of a more serious offense does not equate with increased risk of reoffense on parole and risk to public safety,” Alabama Appleseed said in its statement.
Behavior behind bars
SPLC, Alabama Arise and the ACLU of Alabama also want to give point reductions to parole applicants without infractions in the prior year and max out points for those offenses at four, while providing mitigation for incidents that applicant did not instigate.
“Given the undisputedly violent conditions inside Alabama’s correctional facilities, it would be unreasonable and cruel to house individuals in these settings and then punish them for defending themselves by assessing points for the mere act of survival,” they said in their proposed changes.
Alabama Appleseed proposed subtracting a point for applicants without any disciplinary infractions for at least the past three years and giving additional credit for longer periods without violations.  It also suggested imposing three points for those with at least one disciplinary infraction that involved violence for the past 12 months and four points for applicants with multiple violent offenses. In both cases, the applicants should have instigated the violent incident.
“The ability to follow strict institutional rules and avoid conflict with other individuals in overcrowded, unairconditioned, dilapidated, understaffed prisons and avoid disciplinaries year after year is a strong indicator that someone has developed the skills and character to do extremely well outside of prison,” Appleseed staff wrote.
Additionally, Alabama Appleseed wants to expand the number of programs that give people who have been incarcerated credit if they participate, and impose not more than one point for those who have not secured housing or a job as part of their reentry plan, while allowing a one-point credit for those who have included housing or job arrangement.
The proposed parole guideline allows the parole board to issue two points for applicants who have not made any effort to put forward a reentry plan.
“It seems blatantly unfair to penalize incarcerated individuals for their inability to secure housing while in prison when a statewide commission has cited gaps in the state’s own provision of services as a reason for the struggles accessing housing,” Alabama Appleseed said in the comments.
Community input
Advocates also weighed in on the influence of community input.
The group that included Alabama Arise, SPLC and the ACLU of Alabama want the parole guidelines to remove a point if no one in the community opposes applicants getting parole, but points would be imposed if the public opposed parole.
Alabama Appleseed wants a point system that is based on input from those who are more familiar with the applicant. Applicants would get a one-point reduction if representatives from the Alabama Department of Corrections or a parole officer supported individuals getting granted parole, for example. Points would be imposed if there was opposition from law enforcement or advocacy groups, with more assessed if the victim or victims opposed parole.
The public comment period will last for the next few weeks at which point a legislator can request that the Legislative Council review the proposed guidelines and can either accept, amend or reject them.
The parole board published the updated guidelines several weeks after the Alabama Legislature approved an amendment offered by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, that made funding for the parole board contingent on the members updating the guidelines.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

Joe Lombardo this year. (Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that are sealing or expunging eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”
The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Elsewhere

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
Lombardo’s vetoes once again thwart tenant-friendly housing reforms

This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed several tenant protection bills, including one that would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another that sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EvictionCourt_RC_103123_001-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)On the morning that Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated, I was speaking to a civic group on the dangers of political polarization. 
I opened by reflecting on our increasingly violent political climate as indicated by these shootings and last year’s attempted assassination of Donald Trump.
At a lunch table afterward, someone challenged me. “That Trump thing,” she said, “was staged. It was set up to make him look brave.” 
Startled, I asked about the blood. “Faked by the Secret Service when they tackled him.” 
The man killed?  “A mistake.” 
This was from a woman who 30 minutes before had argued that religious fanatics are causing today’s polarization.
Later that day, voices on the other side of the political spectrum insinuated that Gov. Tim Walz was somehow responsible for Hortman’s death because he had appointed the alleged killer to a volunteer advisory board. Or crazy Marxists were behind it. 
I was feeling whiplash.
Two tragedies. Two shocking theories. One disturbing pattern: If a terrible event can help the other side, they must have orchestrated it.
This partisan reflex is connected to what social scientists refer to as zero-sum bias — the tendency to assume that a gain for an out-group creates a loss for the in-group. It also stems from motivated reasoning about politics: We don’t just take in public facts neutrally — we filter them through our political identities. If an event seems to bolster our opponents, we instinctively look for a way to discredit it or blame them for it. Think 9/11 (Bush set it up to justify war) or the Sandy Hook kindergarten massacre (a hoax by gun control fanatics).
Of course, tragic events often do have political consequences. A shooting can lead to pressure for gun control. An assassination attempt can rally support. 
Consequences, however, are not the same as causes. Correlation does not prove conspiracy.
But in our era of conflict entrepreneurs, viral social media, and deep mistrust of institutions, the leap from “this helps them” to “they set it up” is becoming more common — and more reflexive. There are no disturbed lone wolves or random events anymore. It’s the other side’s plan. Internet clicks and partisan admiration flow to those who proclaim these hidden “truths.”
We have to name and resist this. As individuals and communities, we can hold two truths at once: That tragedy can have political consequences, and that those consequences do not always mean orchestration.

While it’s summer and classrooms are quiet, school board work across Vermont is anything but. With the passage of H.454 and major education transformation on the horizon, school boards from Arlington to Canaan are deep in discussion, preparing for what comes next. Decisions made now will shape the future of public education in rural Vermont and communities are stepping up to make sure their voices are heard.
The Rural School Community Alliance is a grassroots group representing over 100 of these communities across Vermont. We stand for the values, expectations and hopes rural Vermonters have for their children’s educations, their communities’ well-being and the future of rural life in our state. We advocate for strong, community-based public schools and for rural Vermonters to have a democratic voice in decisions about their future.
Vermont is a rural state with the highest percentage of rural students in the nation (54%). Over 70% of Vermont’s schools are considered rural.

RSCA was formed in January to bring Vermont-specific data, national research and firsthand rural experience into the Statehouse debate over H.454. We worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure the voices of rural communities were heard. We advocated transparently for small but meaningful changes to the legislation. These changes were adopted in the Senate and for the most part preserved in the final version of the bill. 
While H.454 isn’t perfect, we believe it includes enough safeguards to allow for our continued engagement in the legislative process. We now turn our attention to the next phase: the appointment of a redistricting task force. This group will shape Vermont’s future education system, and its work carries both opportunity and risk. 
We are moving forward with good will, knowing that Supervisory Unions are to be included as part of the charge of the redistricting task force.
Supervisory unions are made up of multiple school districts working collaboratively to reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve educational opportunities. Each SU shares a superintendent, central office and board with representation from each district in the Union.
SUs are vital to the success of rural public education in Vermont. They offer a practical balance: schools keep local decision-making while gaining the financial and operational benefits of shared services. Among governance models, SUs are the most transparent, cost-effective and educationally sound option Vermont has.
We believe Vermont can thoughtfully create larger SUs to meet the goals of H.454, especially with adjustments for the unique needs of low-population regions and areas with geographic barriers.
RSCA sees potential for cost savings and improved quality, but only if SUs remain the core governance model for rural Vermont. Already, school districts and SU boards involved with RSCA are debating and considering information for the task force that reflects the needs of their regions and will support the task at hand. 
Over the last six months, aspects of our work have become clear. In rural Vermont:
Equity matters. Rural families are saying clearly that equity does not mean “newer and fewer.” It means strong and local. Young children should be educated close to home in excellent elementary schools of all sizes. Accessible schools are essential to rural families.
Research shows that even high-quality educational offerings are of little benefit if children must spend hours on a bus to reach them. Strong, local public schools grounded in their communities are a cornerstone of educational equity for rural children.
Place matters. Young families want to live in close-knit communities with strong local schools: places with childcare, preschool and elementary education at their heart. For rural Vermont communities to thrive, they need young families to stay, return or choose to move there.
Educational opportunities centered in place will bring them. Closed schools, depopulation, diminished economic opportunities and declining home values will turn them away. 
Democracy matters. People are losing faith in democracy. That’s why any new system must strengthen, not weaken, their connection to democratic decision-making.
Rural Vermont is skilled in democratic decision-making; it is rooted in our history and practiced regularly as we grapple to solve problems locally. It is a strength, not a flaw, and we must protect it. In rural Vermont we protect democracy by practicing it.
As Vermonters work to build a sustainable, high-quality and cost-effective education system for the future, it must reflect and respect these rural values. That means equity, and it means community-centered and strong local voices in governance.
Thriving rural community schools, working together in supervisory unions, are at the heart of this vision.

When the new U.S. Citizenship Office in Colchester opened in 2022, it was dedicated to Capt. John Lonergan as a Medal of Honor recipient and a naturalized citizen.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  William L. McKone: Immigrants, loyalty and Gettysburg.","This commentary is by William L. McKone of South Burlington. He is president of the Fenian Historical Society, and author of “Vermont’s Irish Rebel: Captain John Lonergan.” He is a former Cold War intelligence analyst who resigned from the National Security Agency in 1983 in protest against President Reagan’s security policies.


In St. Joseph’s Cemetery on Archibald Street in Burlington, the graves in a family plot in the Irish section, set off from the French and Syrian-Lebanese groupings, have only humble markers, except for an impressive monument to Capt. John Lonergan. Born in County Tipperary, he raised a company of Irishmen, Vermont’s only ethnic unit, that served in the Union forces for nine months in the Civil War.
Their only battle was at Gettysburg, where Lonergan’s gallantry was recognized with a Medal of Honor. He led his company as the spearhead of the two Vermont regiments ordered to attack the Confederate flank on July 3, 1863, at the crucial moment that helped turn back the final rebel assault on Cemetery Ridge.
Many of Lonergan’s men were Irish-born immigrants who, like his own family, fled as refugees when the disastrous failure of the potato crop called the Great Hunger drove them from Ireland. Out of a population of 8 million, a million died of hunger and disease while another million escaped into exile. Large numbers of Irish came to America, often by way of British North America (later called Canada) since travel there was less costly from British ports.
Reacting to this influx of immigrants — often illiterate and speaking little English, Catholic, and many ill and impoverished — Burlington in 1849 prohibited all steamships from dropping any Irish off in the port without medical inspection. Concern for disease was the only check on immigration at this time and the Lonergan family settled in the town that year. Lonergan’s father was a skilled craftsman, a cooper who opened his own shop making barrels; each of his sons learned this trade, much in demand at the port.
John Lonergan joined the Vermont militia in Brandon as a private in 1860, but the next year he organized his own militia company of Irishmen, the Emmet Guards, in Burlington. When war broke out in April of 1861, he was ready to muster for the initial 90-day federalization by Lincoln. 
Not chosen at the time, his Irish company was selected for duty in the 3-year call-up in May when the 2nd  Vermont Regiment assembled in Burlington. However, Gov. Fairbanks found fault with his company and disbanded it, partly because of his prejudice against the Irish. Lonergan persisted, raising another company the next year under a new governor, and served to preserve the Union that had sheltered so many immigrants in their time of need.
Even if born in the country, some of the soldiers might not have been considered citizens because the 14th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing birthright citizenship was not ratified until 1868 and many of those foreign born had not undergone naturalization. At this time, the British did not recognize the right of persons born in the United Kingdom to renounce their citizenship. 
After the war, Lonergan did become a naturalized citizen, taking the oath of allegiance in 1867. Possibly he was encouraged to do so by his employment as a seasonal U.S. Customs inspector under his former brigade commander at Gettysburg, Gen. Stannard. Lonergan was at this time also the head of the Vermont branch of the Fenian Brotherhood, the militant Irish nationalists fighting the British empire to restore the independence of Ireland.
He explained later that his loyalty was strong for both the United States and his birthplace, “When an Irishman takes a wife, as he is sometimes liable to, is he likely to forget his mother? American is the Irishman’s wife, but he does not forget his mother Ireland.”
When the new U.S. Citizenship Office in Colchester opened under President Biden in June of 2022, it was dedicated to Capt. John Lonergan as a Medal of Honor recipient and a naturalized citizen. Since I had published his biography, “Vermont’s Irish Rebel,” in 2014, I was honored to speak at the impressive dedication ceremony.
This included the naturalization of 14 new citizens (a nod to Vermont’s role as the 14th  state), who solemnly swore to “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” They qualified to be naturalized only after passing an examination that many of our native-born citizens might find challenging; the oath is similar to that sworn by the military and other government officials.
On April 14, 2025, Mohsen Mahdawi, a student holding a green card for 10 years, was summoned to this Colchester facility as a final step in his naturalization process. But this was a change in the schedule that made him suspicious, so he notified our three Vermont congressional representatives.
As he feared, he was detained at the facility by masked agents who transported him away in an unmarked vehicle. Sens. Sanders and Welch, along with Rep. Balint, objected to this action calling it “immoral, inhumane, and illegal,” and Mahdawi was released by a federal judge on May 30. 
After his life of fighting against injustice and oppression, Lonergan might well have turned over in his grave on Archibald Street had he known that his name was associated with such a violation.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana officials are assessing the financial impact on the state budget of the nearly 1,000-page priority megabill President Donald Trump signed into law Friday.
Formerly known as the “big, beautiful bill,” it will reform the nation’s welfare programs, extend 2017 tax cuts and invest billions of dollars to ramp up deportation efforts for noncitizens. 
The contentious measure narrowly advanced through both chambers of Congress, largely along party-line votes with a handful of Republican defectors that didn’t include any of Indiana’s delegation. 
Any impact to the federal budget largely depends on one’s political lens — with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculating a $3.25 trillion deficit while Republicans, using a so-called “budget trick,” say it will save $507 billion.

Impacts for the average Hoosier include a tax deduction for federal taxes on tips and overtime alongside phased out clean energy incentives, as detailed by the IndyStar. And according to U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, of Fort Wayne, the tax increase without the bill would have been $1,936 for the average Hoosier family.
But how the megabill will effect Indiana’s finances and the state budget is far less certain. Some provisions may indirectly have a long-term impact that’s more difficult to measure, such as the slightly higher take-home pay or fewer farm and construction workers following immigration raids. 
Additionally, some of the biggest reductions — like Medicaid reform — will be phased in, meaning it won’t immediately hit Indiana’s coffers. Still, according to early estimates, Indiana could lose out on hundreds of millions in health care provider taxes and pay millions more to administer food programming. This comes on the heels of a $2 billion projected revenue shortfall that disrupted the 2025 legislative session and prompted cuts across the board for state agencies.
Gov. Mike Braun’s communications team didn’t respond to questions about the megabill and its fiscal impact on Indiana, instead touting his support for Trump’s priorities. 
“Here in Indiana, we’ve shown what conservative, responsible leadership looks like. Thanks to strong Republican management, we’ve protected our AAA credit rating, maintained healthy reserves, and kept Indiana one of the best-managed states in the nation. The Big Beautiful Bill takes important steps to safeguard Medicaid for the Hoosiers who truly need it by finally cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. We’ll continue working closely with our federal partners and agency leaders to implement the changes thoughtfully, protecting essential services while living within our means,” he said in a statement.
 What about Medicaid?

The new law seeks to cut more than $1.1 trillion nationwide, with most of those dollars coming from Medicaid. Experts estimate that 11.8 million people could lose their insurance coverage — whether Medicaid or on the federal marketplace — by 2034. 
Greater numbers of uninsured people could hit rural hospitals especially hard because they operate on thin profit margins and serve greater numbers of Medicaid enrollees.
Four congressional Democrats wrote that 338 hospitals would be impacted by Medicaid reductions, naming a dozen Indiana hospitals deemed to be at risk. To mitigate those concerns, the U.S. Senate created a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals — but it’s unclear how much of that could be dedicated to Indiana. 
A KFF analysis estimates the state will lose out on $23 billion over the next ten years for Medicaid, with the biggest portion of those losses attributed to work requirements for able-bodied adults. Hoosiers could fall off the rolls for several reasons: paperwork errors, not working or making too much money to meet eligibility levels.
‘Indiana needs a HIP replacement’, social services secretary says about insurance program

Newly passed work requirements largely seem to align with what Indiana lawmakers imposed earlier this year with one exception: Indiana’s exception applies to all parents, while the federal exception to work requirements is limited to parents with children under the age of 14. 
The work requirements apply to those in the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers low- to moderate-income adults. Last month, the Family and Social Services secretary, who oversees the state’s Medicaid program, warned that the megabill could fundamentally change HIP because of a proposed cap on provider taxes. 
“That’s how we pay for the Healthy Indiana Plan,” Secretary Mitch Roob told lawmakers. “If (the proposal is) signed into law, this would require the state of Indiana to significantly roll back eligibility in the Healthy Indiana Plan.
“Not because we want to — because we have no match.”
Indiana currently taxes Medicaid providers at the maximum rate of 6%, netting $1.6 billion from hospitals in the 2024 fiscal year which, in turn, was used to leverage $5.5 billion in reimbursements from the federal government. 
That $1.6 billion, along with revenue from the state’s cigarette tax, paid for Indiana’s 10% stake in HIP, while the federal government picked up 90% of the tab.
Congress set a new limit of 3.5% for provider taxes in the megabill, slashing the amount Indiana can collect. FSSA didn’t have an estimate for how much it would collect under the 3.5% threshold, noting that it currently has a waiver under consideration to restructure the provider tax. That pending application would also impose a provider tax on Managed Care Entities for the first time following legislation from earlier this year.
 And what about SNAP?

Congress also approved work requirements for food benefits, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for those up to the age of 64. The federal government funds all of the costs associated with SNAP and states pick up part of the tab for administrative costs. Now, more costs will be the responsibility of states. 
Indiana has 588,184 SNAP beneficiaries across 281,112 households, as of April 2025. The average household gets $409.37 per month to assist with food purchasing. 
FSSA’s Marcus Barlow, the deputy chief of staff and communications director, said the state currently has a $97 million obligation for SNAP’s administrative costs. That number is expected to go up by $49 million to $146 million.
The state will bear an additional cost of $147 million due to its 9.52% error rate for 2024. States with error rates below 6% saw far smaller increases. Together, the state is expected to spend $196 million more on SNAP once these cuts take effect.
The Hill reported that states will be required to partially fund SNAP beginning in 2028 — two years after the midterms.
As noted by the Food Research & Action Center, error rates aren’t the same as fraud, which is rare. Standard error reporting was paused during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to a spike in error rates when reporting resumed.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.2 million people may lose access to SNAP under the megabill, which advocates say will increase food insecurity.

However, the current plan has some residents crying foul, arguing the proposal will create more development, but not more affordable housing. 
The city first began crafting the new plan in the Summer of 2023. Under state law, Michigan communities must have a master plan on file to serve as a guide for development and ensure any developments meet certain criteria. 
While the plan is still in draft form – with another draft on the way – some Ann Arborites are calling on the commission and the city council to “pause the plan” arguing the draft is misguided, raising concerns with several of the projections included in the document and calling for more public outreach in shaping the project plan. 
Residents argue public should be more involved in planning process
Tom Stulberg, a member of the steering team for the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network, told the Michigan Advance that the group would like city officials to pause their efforts on the plan to engage with residents at a neighborhood level, so each neighborhood could be evaluated for what might work in each area. From that engagement the city could assemble a community vision on what the citizens of Ann Arbor want the future of the city to look like. 
John Godfrey, another member of the group’s steering team said the Neighborhood Network was launched out of concerns that the comprehensive plan process was moving forward without residents knowing about it, pointing to a goal of reconnecting residents with civic life. 
According to the group’s website, it has gathered more than 3,600 signatures on a petition calling on the city council to suspend the planning process and take steps to unite the community by ensuring all residents are fully informed about the comprehensive plan. 
“I think we’re moving toward a new level of just civic engagement. If we can sustain this after the comprehensive plan, and find ways to bring the residents together into more regular conversations with one another, not directed by the city, but directed by the residents themselves. That would be a good and healthy thing to do,” Godfrey said. 
He pointed to Boulder, Colorado and Madison, Wisconsin as examples of how Ann Arbor should be approaching their comprehensive plan, noting that those plans were driven by input from neighborhoods.

Lisa Disch, councilmember for Ann Arbor’s Ward 1 and the council’s representative on the city planning commission, said there have been a number of opportunities for the public to engage and offer input on the plan, noting that the consultants working with the city on the plan held several meetings at the city’s downtown and branch libraries as well as events at summer festivals and fairs. 
However, she said the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network’s opposition to aspects of the planning process has drawn a lot of attention to the plan, bringing on an unforeseen round of public engagement through May. 
According to the project’s website, the council began stakeholder interviews and data collection in Fall 2023, and distributed an online survey in Winter 2024, holding public engagement sessions in April and May of this year following the release of the draft plan. 
As of April of this year, the planning commission and the city council have held eight open houses, had more than 30 participants in seven small group discussions and targeted outreach efforts, held more than 20 interviews with individuals, while the city has received more than 3,100 survey responses.
However, members of the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network have emphasized the survey’s non-scientific nature, pointing to a disclaimer noting that the survey was not intended to statistically represent the entire community. 
In a May 5 memo sent to the city council, the network argued the city council’s outreach efforts were insufficient, with the city failing to mail residents a notice about the effort and how to engage. 
In retrospect, Disch said she might have thought about sending out a postcard earlier in the process. 
“It seems like a pretty simple thing, and it might have caught more people’s attention, but it might not have. They might have just thrown them out, and we get a bunch of those bounced back,” she said. 
Following the release of the next draft of the plan, Disch said there will be a 63-day comment period on the revised draft, which she expects will begin in late summer and early fall and will likely be accompanied by a community-wide mailing with information on how to participate. 
Questions on goals and debates on housing needs
Alongside concerns around engagement, the Neighborhood Network also raised concerns about several pieces of data within the plan, arguing that the current draft fails to meet both best practices for city planning and the state’s requirements that a master plan include guidelines and strategies for providing “a range of housing types, costs, affordability, attainability, ages, and other characteristics, including single- and multiple-family dwellings, to serve the housing demands of a diverse population.”
In a May 5 memo to the city council and the planning commission, the network slammed the initial draft of the proposal, arguing the plan puts forth goals, without citing proper evidence or offering any methodology, while failing to consider the impacts new housing development would have on infrastructure, demographics, the tax burden on local communities and its effects on the city’s long-term financial stability.
The group has also split with the city council on the best way to address Ann Arbor’s steep housing costs.

Looking toward 2050, one of the draft comprehensive plan’s goals is to increase the supply and diversify the types of housing available for households of different sizes, abilities and income levels. 
Disch compared the severity of Ann Arbor’s housing affordability issues to those in San Francisco, identifying zoning constraints as part of that problem.
In hopes of addressing these issues, the council is looking to bring more homes into single-family zoned areas, with Disch explaining that it should be possible to build at least two homes per parcel in the city’s lowest density residential areas under this plan.
While the city’s current housing stock mostly consists of single family homes and multifamily apartments and condos, the new comprehensive plan would look to add more medium-density housing – like duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, townhomes and court housing – into existing neighborhoods. 
However, Stulberg, a former subdivision developer, noted that simply building these missing middle housing types does not equal missing middle prices.

Godfrey argued the planning commission and city council had taken too straightforward an approach to the issue, contending the city’s issue stems from affordability rather than supply. 
While the plan calls for sustainability and to reduce the number of commuters to reduce carbon emissions, an increased supply of expensive housing within the city could result in population growth without reducing the number of commuters, Stulberg said, as developers build more affordable housing in the greater Ann Arbor area. 
Godfrey also noted that developers within the city are responding to the influx of college students – with enrollment at the University of Michigan reaching a record high in 2024 – by building up expensive high rises close to campus. 
Developers are also targeting retirees and alums who are looking to relive their college days, meaning that the market is not responsive to the individuals who cannot afford to live in the city, he said. 
Instead of relying on the market to provide affordable housing, Godfrey pointed to other community based solutions like cooperative housing and the Ann Arbor Community Land Trust, which aims to offer affordable housing options to critical workers who are otherwise unable to afford a home in the city. 
Throughout most of the country, affordability is tied to income, as people who earn less than the average income are unable to afford housing in their area, Godfrey said. However, Ann Arbor has become a major job center. With hubs like the university and its hospital, and high amenities within the city, the issue lies with supply, Disch argued. 
She also emphasized that it will take time to catch up with the excess demand and stabilize rental costs. 
Greg Matthews, one of the lead organizers of Neighbors for More Neighbors Ann Arbor, a coalition of residents in support of the draft plan, said the lack of building for years has led the city to its crisis of affordability. While increasing supply is necessary, it’s not a silver bullet, Matthews said. 
While loosening zoning regulations that prevent the buildup of different types of housing options in order will help meet demand for housing, new developments also support funding for the Ann Arbor Housing Commission, which provides housing to low-income residents. 
However, tax rates for current Ann Arbor homeowners are capped, meaning that new developments, whose property values are not capped, will bring in additional revenue for subsidized housing. 
“I think all of Ann Arbor can approach these issues with open minds and open hearts and understand that the status quo isn’t working and that change is badly needed,” Matthews said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9475-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 07:11:43.232713

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)While the U.S. military was damaging Iran’s nuclear capability with “bunker busting” bombs and cruise missiles, members of Congress sat idly by, watching CNN or FOX, to get their talking points. Then they launched their own bombardment of news releases, and rushed for the television cameras for talking-head interviews.
What they failed to do was exercise their constitutional duty (Article 1, Section 8) to oversee the use of America’s brave fighting men and women in one of the most dangerous (and daring) military operations in history.
Not a single vote was taken. No “ayes” or “nays” were heard. No buttons pushed. No stealthy hand signals to a clerk, indicating their position.
You won’t find a roll call of how Indiana’s delegation (Republican and Democrat) stood on the issue.
How did Congress become so wimpy? Why has it abdicated its most powerful constitutional duty while increasingly autocratic presidents wield unlimited power over the lives of our warfighters, and the future of our nation, and the world?
Not long ago, Congress had guts. And fortitude. Members understood their role in protecting our nation.
Trump: Iran nuclear facilities ‘completely and totally obliterated’ in U.S. strike on 3 sites

In November, 1973, they overwhelmingly passed what has become known as the “War Powers Act,” which requires the president to notify Congress (prior to the bombs dropping, if possible) of any insertion of American troops into hostilities. It further imposes a “60-day deadline for withdrawal” of those troops. The purpose was to rein in the autocratic use of American fighting power in Cambodia.
For history nerds, the Indiana House delegation voted 6-5 against the override of Nixon’s veto, along party lines (John Myers, David Dennis, Elwood Hillis, Earl Landgrebe, Roger Zion and William Bray all voted no; John Brademas, Lee Hamilton, Andy Jacobs, Floyd Fithian, and Phil Hayes all voted yes). Both U.S. Senators (Birch Bayh and Vance Hartke, voted for the override).
Those names should bring back memories. Each put their political future on the line. As it should have been.
Congress used to take its constitutional obligations seriously. Polls did not determine its level of engagement. Congress has declared War 11 times. As early as the War of 1812, it established a “special committee” to oversee the conduct of the War. Again, for the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War, and World War II, special committees were established for the same purpose. The Truman Committee (chaired by future president Harry Truman) intervened in all aspects of World War II, from holding contractors accountable, to pressuring the president and the Pentagon to adjust war strategy.
Why not the Civil War? Well, that is not on the list, because it was a rebellion, not a declared war. But in fact, the most powerful war committee in American history (the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, chaired by Benjamin Wade, R-Ohio) oversaw virtually every aspect of the Civil War, uprooting sutler corruption, calling generals before the committee to answer for battle failures, even helping to force out wimpy generals (there’s that word again), like George McClellan, for a failure to lead.
The War Powers Act worked, briefly. It was invoked under President Gerald Ford during the U.S.S. Mayaguez capture (he notified Congress, but only after it was virtually over). During President Ronald Reagan’s tenure, it was invoked both for Lebanon (1982) and Grenada (1983). Reagan agreed to the 60-day withdrawal of Marines in Lebanon. In Grenada, he did not notify Congress until the shooting match was over. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush did get congressional support for the first Gulf War, but claimed it was not constitutionally required. President Bill Clinton launched unauthorized airstrikes in Yugoslavia in 1999, but refused to comply with the 60-day withdrawal. And Congress refused to stand up to him. When President Barack Obama attacked Libya in 2011, he did not notify Congress. He claimed the airstrikes didn’t constitute “hostilities.”
I guess they were friendly bombs?
Congress abandoned the War Powers Act in 2001, when it passed a “track them down and kill them” resolution, post 9/11. And in 2002, it passed an Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) to support the misguided invasion of Iraq, relying on faulty intelligence. Since then, all insertions of U.S. military might have been predicated upon this AUMF, even though it was precisely limited to the Iraq invasion.

(Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Since the assassination of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, I’ve come across a well-intentioned sentiment countless times: “Even though we disagreed….”
It’s a misplaced qualifier that seems to forget that the job of public office is to disagree. Government exists, to paraphrase President James Madison, because we are not angels — our interests, values and ambitions will always be in tension.
A healthy democracy doesn’t suppress those disagreements or turn them into weapons — it channels them. We elect people not to transcend conflict, but to manage it: to cast unpopular votes, to persuade behind closed doors and in public forums, and to bear the burden of principled disagreement on our behalf.
Melissa Hortman carried that burden splendidly.

She made her case within her caucus, across the aisle, and to the public with discipline and persuasive force. That’s how she gained and held power in a divided state. She disagreed well.
Her killing wasn’t “senseless” in the way that word is often used. It was targeted; intentional, political violence aimed at someone who embodied disagreement.

(Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Since the assassination of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, I’ve come across a well-intentioned sentiment countless times: “Even though we disagreed….”
It’s a misplaced qualifier that seems to forget that the job of public office is to disagree. Government exists, to paraphrase President James Madison, because we are not angels — our interests, values and ambitions will always be in tension.
A healthy democracy doesn’t suppress those disagreements or turn them into weapons — it channels them. We elect people not to transcend conflict, but to manage it: to cast unpopular votes, to persuade behind closed doors and in public forums, and to bear the burden of principled disagreement on our behalf.
Melissa Hortman carried that burden splendidly. Everything I’ve read, and the little I was able to personally witness, demonstrates that she stepped into public life not to erase disagreement, but to organize it and to make it productive. She made her case within her caucus, across the aisle, and to the public with discipline and persuasive force. That’s how she gained and held power in a divided state. She disagreed well.

As we celebrate this milestone, it is important to remind ourselves that everyone’s vote defines a democracy. However, more than 50,000 Missourians are barred from voting because they are on probation or parole.
Missouri is one of 15 states that do not restore voting rights until the end of a person’s supervision post-incarceration, including the completion of probation or parole. People who have served their time and have been released back into society may have to wait years before being eligible to vote. The current law disenfranchises tax-paying citizens who want to engage with their civic duty.
We need to demand that Missouri legislators restore people’s right to vote who are on probation or parole. In recent years, the state legislature has created bipartisan legislation to support its constituents who otherwise cannot cast a ballot.
State Rep. Melanie Stinnett, a Republican from Springfield, and State Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall, filed bills to restore voting rights while on probation or parole but they did not pass. All Missourians should support future bills like H.B. 617 and S.B. 714 that have the potential to protect public safety, increase civic engagement, and extend freedom to all citizens.
Granting people on probation or parole the right to vote would not only increase election turnout but would also be beneficial for all Missourians. Expanding the right to vote reduces recidivism, creating safer communities. People who are formerly incarcerated are less likely to reoffend when they are contributing members of society. Voting is a simple and effective way to prevent crime. 
In addition, people on probation or parole have an increased trust in government when they can vote. Justice-involved individuals are often wary of the government because of their own experiences within the system. Missouri can promote a stronger sense of civic responsibility among all its residents by allowing returning citizens to vote.
Formerly incarcerated people have served their time and should not be further punished by an unjust law. Individuals cannot fully reintegrate into society without voter restoration. They deserve the same right to vote as everyone else. 
Lawmakers should expand voting rights because it is in line with what the United States stands for: Democracy for all. Whole communities will flourish, and state legislators can be a part of positive change. We, the people, need to demand Missouri legislators pass a law that restores a person’s right to vote if they are on probation or parole.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Three unions that represent New Jersey State Police have sued New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin in a bid to block his investigation into whether troopers deliberately slowed down traffic enforcement in response to claims of racial profiling in stops.
Union officials want a state judge to toss five subpoenas Platkin’s office issued in April demanding documents and ordering them to appear before a state grand jury probing the alleged slowdown. They also want the judge to bar the outside attorneys Platkin appointed from investigating further.
In three lawsuits filed late last month, union leaders refute claims of racial profiling, insist the 3,000-member agency is already subject to robust oversight, and accuse Platkin of unconstitutional, retaliatory interference with their rights to advocate for union members.
“In serving the subject subpoenas upon Plaintiffs, the NCOA and its President and three Vice Presidents, Defendants have, by threats, intimidation, coercion or force, engaged in a bald-faced, outrageous attempt at union busting,” states a complaint filed by the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association of New Jersey. The group represents 1,000 state police sergeants.
The State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey, a 1,900-member union that represents troopers and detectives, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association, which represents lieutenants and captains, also filed complaints in state Superior Court in Mercer County, naming the state as well as Platkin as defendants.
The first complaint was filed June 19 — the same day several state legislators introduced a bill that would remove the state police from Platkin’s control. The agency now is part of the state department of law and public safety, which Platkin helms; the seven legislators who sponsored the bill want to make the state police its own department answerable directly to the governor.
Platkin’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the new lawsuits.
Tensions have grown between the state police and Platkin almost since Gov. Phil Murphy nominated him for the post in February 2022. The state police’s union leaders accused Platkin in their June complaints of “continuous and systematic attacks.”
Those lawsuits stem from a report Platkin released in July 2023, in which an academic researcher reviewed more than 6 million traffic stops from 2009 to 2021 and found state troopers stopped, searched, and used force against Black and Hispanic motorists far more than they did against white motorists. Platkin paired the report’s release with an announcement that he would launch a pilot program aimed at reducing racial and ethnic disparities in traffic enforcement statewide.
 Several New Jersey police unions issued notices in 2023 alerting state troopers to “the perils of motor vehicle stops.” The notices now figure prominently in a legal battle between the unions and New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.
Union leaders acted quickly. Within a week, they issued notices to be posted on stations’ union bulletin boards, warning troopers that traffic stops posed perils and “internal and external entities who seemingly wish to see us fail” would be scrutinizing every stop and enforcement action.
“It appears increasingly likely you may be considered guilty until proven innocent by entities with questionable agendas,” one notice read. “Please be safe and protect yourself and your fellow Troopers.”
Last December, the New York Times found that traffic stops plummeted in the eight months after the unions’ warnings. Platkin responded by announcing an investigation into the alleged slowdown and appointing Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the probe.
But union officials disputed criticisms and asked Merrick Garland, U.S. attorney general at the time, to step in and review New Jersey state police stop data. They also complained about a backlog of cases affecting about 100 troopers under investigation by Platkin’s public integrity and accountability office, asking Gov. Phil Murphy and state legislators to intervene.
In their June lawsuits, union officials say Platkin’s concerns are about troopers’ work conduct, so his probe should have been administrative and not criminal. They noted that no troopers had been disciplined for any traffic enforcement deficiencies and that Platkin never launched the pilot program he promised. Their notices of the perils of traffic stops constituted protected union advice to members, they added.
They denied any racial profiling and noted they had their own academic researchers review traffic stops. They came to different conclusions, the union leaders said, citing as an example one trooper whose numbers were skewed because he was assigned to patrol a stretch of the turnpike in Hudson County that’s home to a large Hispanic population. That trooper also used a laser speed detector to target motorists for stops, they added.
They also pointed to oversight ordered in recent decades intended to thwart traffic enforcement abuses, including a federal consent decree in place from 1999 to 2009, the state’s subsequent enactment of a law enforcement professional standards office, and annual performance reviews by the state comptroller’s office. Troopers also must report the demographics of every motorist they stop, use body and dashboard cameras, and undergo regular supervisory reviews of searches, requests, pursuits, and more, they said.
“The New Jersey State Police has for decades been the subject of rigorous and comprehensive internal and external oversight regarding motor vehicle enforcement. As a result, the New Jersey State Police is one of the most professional, well-trained, and competent law enforcement agencies in the country,” attorneys wrote.

Critics say it would raise costs for New Jerseyans. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)A controversial land management rules proposal meant to guard against floods in an expanding portion of New Jersey may see changes ahead of an August deadline for the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt or kill the package.
The scope of any possible changes to the Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rules — more succinctly, Pact Real — remains unclear.
Gov. Phil Murphy’s office confirmed the administration would hold public meetings about the rules proposal next week, but declined to confirm or detail potential changes to the 1,044-page plan.
The voluminous filing seeks to address an array of coastal and inland flood risks over the next 75 years by expanding the state’s flood maps, raising elevation requirements for new construction in areas affected by rising sea levels, and tightening drainage requirements, among numerous other things.
Environmental groups and some local officials have hailed the rules as a necessary step to protect residents and property in a state where severe storms are becoming more and more frequent.
“We’re not really asking for anything radical. We’re not asking for something completely outside of the box. This is just adapting to what we are already experiencing,” Anjuli Ramos, director of Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter. “Just last week, there was a rain event, and multiple streets in Monmouth County and in Ocean County flooded.”
New Jersey saw 17 storms that caused at least $1 billion in damage between 2020 and 2024, according to data maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information. There were 15 such storms over the preceding 40 years after adjustments for inflation.
Severe storms have assaulted other parts of the nation, and flooding from a Texas storm last week killed at least 109, including at least 28 children.
“The only thing that causes more damage than fire is water,” said Barbara Rogers, a township committeewoman in Cranbury, which saw severe flooding from Hurricane Henri in 2021.
Business groups, some Jersey Shore mayors, and the New Jersey Builders Association have opposed the proposed changes, arguing they would further raise New Jersey’s already high cost of living.
The heightened elevation requirement — which would mandate that newly constructed, reconstructed, or enlarged buildings be elevated to 5 feet above the high-water line — has been a frequent focal point of the proposal’s detractors.
“We don’t think it’s supported by the science, and it would be very costly and disruptive to people living at the shore and for businesses at the shore,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which opposes the proposal.
By adopting flood maps of its own that are more expansive than those maintained by federal environmental and emergency response agencies, the state risks mortgage lenders requiring more homebuyers to obtain flood insurance coverage, he said.
Proponents of the proposed rules have argued a larger subscriber pool could lower flood insurance rates — a claim Cantor doubts — as less precarious homes dilute the risk of frequent flooders.
The National Flood Insurance Program, which holds a majority of the country’s flood insurance policies, faces risk of a death spiral driven by claims to a tiny slice of its covered properties that repeatedly flood.
Cantor said a provision in the rules that would require deed notices to include a warning that a property “is likely to be subject to periodic inundation and associated flood damage” could impact property values.
“There are a thousand pages of bad proposals here. Cumulatively, it’s going to be a real negative drag on the state’s economy,” he said.

(Getty Images)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita wants to block courts from authorizing gender identity changes on birth certificates, saying Tuesday he is intervening in cases where Hoosiers have asked trial courts to order the Indiana Department of Health to change the sex on an individual’s birth certificate to reflect their preferred gender identity. 
In a press release, he deemed such changes to be “falsifying records.”
“We’re taking a stand not only for the rule of law but also for common sense,” Rokita said. “Indiana law requires birth certificates to reflect the historical, immutable fact of a child’s sex. One should have no more ability to change the listed sex on a birth certificate years after the fact than to change the newborn’s listed length or weight.”

Rokita also said the state has a clear interest in preserving its own method of issuing the certificates, adding that trial courts have ordered IDOH to change a newborn’s sex in dozens of instances.
The move comes after a March executive order from Gov. Mike Braun, which ended the state’s process from updating gender markers on state documents, specifically birth certificates and driver’s licenses.
The order also instructed state agencies to interpret and apply “sex” to mean “an individual human being’s immutable biological classification as either male or female” as determined at conception. It doesn’t acknowledge intersex Hoosiers.
Previously, individuals seeking to change their gender on a birth certificate were required to obtain a court order. The IDOH would then issue an amended birth certificate. Since the executive order, the Vital Records Division has stopped processing these changes. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a class action lawsuit in March challenging Braun’s order but didn’t have a new comment following Rokita’s release.
Indiana Legal Services said they help hundreds of Hoosiers a year change their name and/or gender markers but said also they do not have a statement at this time. The ILS  provides free legal advice, information, representation and referrals on legal issues including gender marker changes.

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th.  Meet Jessica and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
TUCSON, ARIZ. — On a Saturday afternoon, Deja Foxx is staging a TikTok Live in her living room. A phone tripod is set up in front of her kitchen table. The frame is centered on a slouchy sofa against an adobe wall, where a chile ristra hangs on one side.
“All right, everybody, take your seats,” she tells the mix of young volunteers, family members and campaign staff who are gathered to help her. “You have some really great mail to open, and I’m so excited because usually it’s just me and my mom that do this.”
She goes live and takes a seat next to her mom on the couch.
One volunteer reads a letter from a 19-year-old named Henry from California: “Even though I can’t vote for you, I adore your campaign,” he wrote. “We need more young leaders and new, fresh ideas from us, Gen Z. As someone who grew up on MediCal, and free public school lunch, who currently is uninsured, I enjoy your background and fighting for us.”
Another volunteer read a note from 20-year-old Julie, who wrote that while she’s been frustrated and overwhelmed by the state of politics, following Foxx’s campaign gave her hope. “I’ve been writing to my officials, but wanted to write something positive for a change. Keep doing what you’re doing.”
Other letter writers included a 22-year-old activist who started organizing after the Parkland shooting, a college student in Phoenix who offered to work for Foxx’s political office in the future, a 23-year-old from Chicago who started following her social media years ago, a North Carolina dad of a daughter moving to Arizona, and a Kentucky woman worried about Medicaid coverage. Volunteers spent 30 minutes reading that day’s mail. During the weekly segment, the audience is usually in the thousands.

Most of the notes included a donation, with the amounts ranging from $20 to $2,000. By the end of the read out Foxx had raised $4,000, mostly from people located outside Arizona. Just two days before, she announced she hit $500,000 in campaign donations, raised through 18,000 individual donors.
Just two months ago, Foxx wrote on Substack about the difficulties of running her campaign for Congress as a Gen Z candidate. She made a plea directly to her online followers: “Our biggest challenge and the only one that really matters: You haven’t invested in us yet.”
At the time, a slow trickle of donations was keeping afloat her campaign to fill the seat left by U.S. Rep Raúl Grijalva, who represented the southern Arizona district for over 20 years.
Shortly after the lawmaker’s death in March, his daughter Adelita Grijalva — who has served for decades in local politics on Tucson’s school board and more recently on the Pima County Board of Supervisors — tossed her hat in the ring for the Democratic primary. Then came the endorsements: Arizona U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, and progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The winner of that primary, which takes place July 15 and includes former state Rep. Daniel Hernandez, will almost certainly go on to win the September special election in this solidly Democratic district.
Foxx announced that she would take on Grijalva in early April. Most of her short political life — at 25, she would be the youngest woman elected to Congress — has focused on reproductive rights. She served on the board of Planned Parenthood in Arizona at age 17, worked in Tucson health clinics as a sex educator in high school, and more recently worked on the Prop 139 Ballot Initiative campaign in 2024, which enshrined the right to abortion in the state’s constitution.










If we want to win in 2028, I promise you that it is going to require electing leaders in this party who can be effective messengers.


– Deja Foxx


  Deja Foxx reaches for mail she received from her campaign post office box on Saturday, June 21, 2025, at her home in Tucson, Arizona (Courtney Pedroza for The 19th)
But while Foxx doesn’t have the backing of “the establishment,” as she refers to it, or the name recognition of Grijalva, she’s created her own buzz by using her social media platforms to speak directly to her generation. Over the past month, her stories have been viewed almost 30 million times on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. She also has thousands of followers on Substack. That support and the donations that followed afforded her television advertisements, something that was out of reach when she started.
Her social media savvy has allowed her to bypass the need for big donors, build her own following, and capitalize on national support that’s percolated from the ground up. Along the way she’s making the argument that her social media skills aren’t just part of a campaign strategy, but necessary to communicate the politics of the party as the electorate grows younger and more disillusioned.
“We saw people in the party, in the traditional media, wringing their hands, ‘How did we lose young people in this last election? Why did they move toward apathy and the other side? … And it’s because we’re failing to compete in social media and new media spaces,” Foxx said. “If we want to win in 2028, I promise you that it is going to require electing leaders in this party who can be effective messengers.”

Foxx learned the power of a viral moment when she was a 16-year-old activist for Planned Parenthood. At a town hall in 2017, she asked former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R) why he would deny her the American dream by voting against funding that made birth control accessible to people who grew up in poverty. Foxx, who was insured through Medicaid at the time, got her birth control from Planned Parenthood.
A clip of the exchange went viral. “I woke up the next day and millions had seen the video,” she said. It’s a moment that changed how she thought about activism. The fact that millions of people watched her on their phones and computers put her on equal footing in public discourse with the United States senator, she said. “As a 16-year-old girl working at a gas station … that is remarkable.”
In the nine years since, the political world has grown to recognize the necessity of social media in campaigns, and politicians have turned to Foxx for her expertise. At the same time she was becoming a prominent reproductive rights activist, she used Instagram to build community among her peers through her organization Gen Z Girl Gang. She worked as an influencer and digital strategist for the Kamala Harris campaign in 2019 and later as a social media director at a political action committee. In 2024, she was invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris as an activist and content creator.
But it’s in her own run for Congress where she has been able to test these communication strategies herself. On her TikTok and Instagram accounts, soundbites from her debates have racked up millions of views. More personal reels, like when she surprised her mom with her first batch of campaign literature, have gone viral. She’s embraced being interviewed by independent journalists with followings on places like Substack and YouTube.










She’s using communication styles and platforms that are meeting people where they’re at.


– Jessica Maddox


“She’s using communication styles and platforms that are meeting people where they’re at. That style may turn off some older voters, but it’s going to excite younger voters who are particularly disaffected or disenfranchised or disheartened by American politics and even the Democratic party,” said Jessica Maddox, an associate professor of digital media at the University of Alabama. “I’ve been particularly impressed with her TikTok presence, because it feels very authentic.”
That authenticity is the main ingredient in connecting with young voters online, experts say. Maddox and others pointed to the success of Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign in New York as an example of how young politicians are tapping into social media to drum up real support at the polls. Both candidates utilized platforms to engage with people, like Gen Z, who are likely to sit out primaries where voters tend to be older.
The strategy puts lesser known candidates on a more equal playing field, allowing them to subvert the traditional hierarchies that fuel campaigns. “There’s always been a tight relationship between legacy media and politics, and social media kind of upends that,” Maddox said. “[Foxx] can kind of bypass more traditional outlets and get the message out herself.”
Social media has also turned a local race into a national fundraiser, which has helped her stay competitive. Candidates like Grijalva and Hernandez have benefited from deeper donor pockets, and outside support from political action committees. By early May, both candidates had already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the Arizona Republic. Their latest campaign finance numbers are expected to be released soon. Foxx announced she had hit $600,000 in donations at the end of June.
“It’s an interesting social media element that someone these days could have supporters kind of all over the country, even though they’re running for a very specific seat,” said Kathryn Coduto, a professor of media science at Boston University.
While there is a scarcity of polls in the race, a recent one commissioned by Foxx’s campaign shows her name recognition has risen significantly since May, when half of likely voters hadn’t heard of her. And, on Wednesday, David Hogg’s political action committee announced it would be endorsing her in the race. Hogg, who became famous for his activism after the Parkland mass shooting, now runs a political organization called Leaders We Deserve, aimed at building generational change for Democrats.
“If we replace one of the oldest members of Congress with the youngest — Deja is just 25 years old — we could send an incredibly strong message about which direction the Democratic Party is heading in, and show people how we are dramatically changing to meet this moment,” Hogg said in an Instagram Reel.
While Foxx has worked as an influencer in the past, now that she’s running for office that label has been used to undercut her years of political work and activism. At her first debate, Foxx also pointed out that some of her opponents have belittled her influencer experience. In recent news articles, people associated with Grijalva’s campaign have questioned whether Foxx’s national reach is the same as in-district community support.
The label “influencer” carries a lot of baggage, experts say. It’s still seen as superficial or trivial despite its power in activism and politics. It’s also another way of writing off young people, particularly women, as unserious.
“It’s seen as like little girls playing instead of actually utilizing this tool to accomplish something and talk to constituents,” Coduto said.

Jade Larson, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on political fandom and social media, said it’s also not surprising that there is such a stigma around being a politician-influencer.
“Every time media is used in a new way in politics, it’s this scandalous thing,” she said. “You can track it all the way back to Bill Clinton going on the ‘Late Night Show’ and playing saxophone, to Obama starting POTUS on Twitter, to Trump making his own social media [network]. It’s always something that’s scandalous, and people push back against it until it kind of becomes the mainstream and the norm.”
Arguably it is the mainstream now. The power of social media that Foxx tapped into nearly a decade ago has only grown more influential in politics and the media — two industries that are closely intertwined. A report from Pew Research Center found that over half of U.S. adults get some of their news from social media, with women and Democrats making up greater regular news consumers on apps like TikTok and Instagram. These users also skew younger, with those between the ages of 18 to 40 making up the bulk of social media news consumers. In a separate poll by Pew Research, 48 percent of TikTok users ages 18 to 29 say keeping up with politics is one of the reasons they are on the platform.
“A whole lot of congresspeople can give a very solid MSNBC interview,” Foxx said. But as someone who interviewed them as a content creator at the State of the Union, “I’m telling you that when they are put in front of an iPhone, there are so many members that fail to communicate. They don’t think the way that our generation thinks. They fail to understand sound bites and algorithms, and youth or even meme culture.”
At the same time that these social media strategies are taking off, voting power is also starting to shift to the very people that use them. Soon, Gen Z and Millennials will have just as much political sway as Gen X and the Baby Boomers — if they go out and vote, Coduto said.
“If you can cultivate enough excitement and you can find a way to really break through and get people to the polls by using social media, then I think it’s going to be an unstoppable strategy.”

Lawmakers have appropriated funds to move the submarine to another location. (Photo by Jim Argo/Provided by the Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY— Republican lawmakers are facing criticism from both sides of the aisle for spending over $10 million in taxpayer money on three special interest projects that appear to have limited benefit to the entire state.
Critics said the late-session vote to allocate $5 million to build a sculpture park in Edmond, $4 million to relocate a World War II submarine in Muskogee and $1.8 million to make infrastructure improvements at an industrial park in Frederick amount to pork-barrel spending that benefits constituents living in Republican districts. 
Supporters though are defending the investments, saying they will have far-reaching impacts beyond the local communities. They say they are not pork-barrel spending, a type of allocation in which lawmakers award taxpayer money to specific local projects that have questionable benefit to the entire state.
In the final days of session, the measure barely secured passage in the Senate, mustering the minimum 25 needed votes.
“I thought it was a pork bill,” said Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, who voted against House Bill 2794.
He said it sent money to three projects without an application process or avenue for any other entities that needed funding.
“If you are going to fund a monument park or something like that, there are a lot of communities across Oklahoma that would like to apply to receive something similar,” Mann said. “That didn’t happen. I thought it was just a pork bill. Nothing competitive about it.”
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, said he opposed the bill because it spends “taxpayer money on isolated projects in three localized areas,” which doesn’t benefit every Oklahoman and clearly amounted to pork.
Jett said his constituents are now paying for an Edmond park that they may not be able to afford the gas money to visit, and that’s being built in a suburban community that already has an ample number of city parks and other luxuries.
“If I remember right, it seemed like a lot of money to be spent on not moving Oklahoma forward,” said Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, who also opposed the spending.
Supporters of the projects though said that they will be beneficial to the entire state and are a worthwhile expenditure for the Progressing Rural Economic Prosperity, or PREP, Fund. The legislative fund is designed to support economic development in rural communities. Lawmakers have said the expenditures are designed to make those communities more economically competitive.
“The projects funded through House Bill 2794 represent strategic investments in economic development, which is exactly what the PREP Fund was created to support,” said Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, in a statement. “While these projects are located in specific communities, their benefits extend well beyond local borders. The money is going toward economic development and infrastructure to support local communities, including a hospital in Frederick.”
He did not directly answer specific questions asking why state money should be allocated to support these three projects, including funding for The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park in his home city of Edmond, an Oklahoma City suburb of over 99,000 residents.
The $50 million sculpture park, set to open fall 2026, is under construction along Route 66. The 62-acre park will feature over 40 sculptures, a dog park, playground, ponds for fishing, a hiking trail, a walking trail, a stage and event lawn. So far, supporters have raised $37.4 million.
“While the park lives in Edmond, its impact is much more far reaching,” said Melissa Pepper, The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park executive director. 
The USS Batfish, a World War II naval submarine, is currently at Muskogee War Memorial Park. During the war, it sank three Japanese Imperial Navy submarines. In 2019, the submarine was damaged due to flooding. 
Supporters plan to use the state funding to move it to Three Forks Harbor, which is located near where the Arkansas, Grand and Verdigris rivers converge. 
“This is history, not pork,” said James Erb, curator of the Muskogee War Memorial Park Museum. 
He also said that it was important to remember and preserve history because “otherwise, we are doomed to repeat it.”
“If it was in California, where there’s submarines for a dime a dozen, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but this is Oklahoma’s final submarine,” Erb said.
Rep. Neil Hays, R-Checotah, who defended spending money on the submarine during questioning on the House floor, did not return a message left seeking comment.
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, and Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry, who authored the bill, did not respond to a request for comment.
Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, said while he supports preserving history, he doubted the submarine drew very many visitors. He also said The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park was categorized as “rural development,” despite Edmond being a suburban community.
While nothing in state law prohibits lawmakers from spending money on special projects, Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said the three expenditures seemed inconsistent at a time when Republicans also cut the state income tax by 0.25%. That’s expected to cost the state about $350 million.
“When you decide to cut income tax, then you have to say no to some really worthwhile projects,” she said.

It was the summer of 2023 and the two of us – Idaho Capital Sun senior reporter Clark Corbin and Extremely American podcast host Heath Druzin – had just finished a game of pub trivia in Boise.
Although we are both journalists, we became friends because of our shared love of backpacking, skiing, climbing and causing trouble. 
A year earlier, Corbin wrote Into the Zone of Death, a first-person account of a remote backpacking trip with Druzin into Yellowstone National Park.
Reporting the story took us deep in the Yellowstone backcountry. And even though the Bechler Meadows mosquitoes are highly evolved killing machines that bit us both thousands of times (even through our clothing!) Into the Zone of Death became Corbin’s favorite story.
Since then, we wanted to combine our love of outdoor adventure with a major longform reporting project.
That’s when Druzin leaned forward that night at the brewery.
“The 30th anniversary of wolf reintroduction is coming up in 2025, and I think a lot of people are going to be sleeping on the anniversary,” Duzin said. 
Wolves are a native species that the American government and settlers essentially eradicated from the Western U.S. by the 1940s, thanks to bounties and poison. 
Reintroducing wolves in 1995 was one of the most controversial and successful wildlife recovery stories in American history, and Idaho was on the front lines.
Over the summer of 2023 Druzin developed an outline, and we fine-tuned the most ambitious story pitch that Corbin had ever heard.
The pitch for Howl involved calling up some of the country’s most prominent wolf experts and convincing them to hike deep into some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 with two strangers as they shared their story and the wolves’ story in granular detail.
We wanted to give Howl a wild edge and help our audience understand a little bit about where wolves live.

Sign up for our free email newsletter at IdahoCapitalSun.com/Subscribe.


We developed Howl as both a podcast season and written longform series, hoping the two could both complement each other and also be able to stand on their own.
Reporting the story would require pulling Corbin out of the Idaho Capital Sun’s small nonprofit newsroom for weeks of field reporting, undertaking a 1,000-mile road trip across the West and all the time, travel and expense that came with that.
After the reporting and research, writing would take several additional weeks.
Obviously Howl would never get off the ground and was doomed to fail under its own weight.
But then Corbin brought the pitch to Idaho Capital Sun Editor-in-Chief Christina Lords.
She said “yes.”
And Howl got the green light.
 Reconstructing the story of wolf capture and reintroduction

The first major source to agree to participate in Howl was Carter Niemeyer, a wildlife biologist and former government trapper who darted the first wolf captured in Canada for reintroduction to the U.S. 30 years ago.
Niemeyer is a larger-than-life character who stands 6 feet, 6 inches tall and is as wild as the wolves that he captured and carried out of the 20-foot-deep Canadian snow.

Over the course of more than 10 interviews spread across almost a year and a half, Niemeyer told us in great detail how a small team traveled to Canada to capture wolves to bring back to Idaho and Yellowstone in 1995 and 1996.
The plan involved tranquilizer guns and helicopters.
Along the way, Niemeyer was challenged to an impromptu, drunken wolf-skinning competition (which he won). 
On the same project, while capturing wolves in temperatures of 50 below zero, Niemeyer developed frostbite in his toe and was told to pack up and head home (he stayed, because the job wasn’t finished).
Due to his career working on controversial projects for various government agencies, Niemeyer kept detailed notes, records, journals, photographs and even homemade movies of his work with wolves over the decades, which proved extremely valuable in the reporting of Howl.
Niemeyer has also written three books of his own about wolves and wolf reintroduction. 
During one Howl interview session, Corbin spent six hours at Niemeyer’s house watching movies Niemeyer made with a handheld video camera of wolf capture operations in Canada.
As they watched the movies, Corbin asked questions and Niemeyer narrated what they were seeing.
There was footage of helicopters, tranquilized wolves being given exams, kennels being loaded and unloaded into cargo planes and even clips from wolf reintroduction team briefings.
Corbin used the footage and interviews to write the narrative in the first episode of the Howl written series, Carter’s Hope, which opens with Niemeyer riding in the helicopter with a wolf in his sights.

Last summer, Niemeyer met us in Central Idaho. He led us into the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, which was one of the sites of wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
He demonstrated how he tracked wolves and pointed out wolf tracks and scat that we would have hiked right past.
Niemeyer taught us how to howl for wolves.
How wildlife cameras work.
How traps work.
About bait.
Niemeyer also told us that he has been tracking and capturing wolves since before they were reintroduced, and that he isn’t seeing wolves in Idaho like he used to.
He told us about the packs that no longer exist. And he told us about how he no longer sees wolves in many of the areas outside of Idaho City that used to be relative wolf hot spots.
We used that information in Ghost Wolves, the final episode of the Howl podcast and written series. 
 Reporting on wolves from Yellowstone National Park 

The next major source to participate in Howl was Doug Smith, a biologist who headed up Yellowstone National Park’s wolf project for almost 30 years until he retired in 2022.
Druzin had interviewed Smith a couple of times over the years for other stories and somehow convinced Smith to backpack with us into wolf country in the northeast section of Yellowstone, along Cache Creek.
By his own count, Smith has participated in more than 1,000 news interviews in his career, but had never done a backpacking trip with any journalists.

Many news interviews with government officials in leadership positions or prominent roles are coordinated or overseen by a government public affairs or public information officer.
But because Smith is now retired, he was able to bring his son, Sawyer, and some fly rods on the trip – not a public affairs officer who might get squeamish about sensitive questions and controversial topics. 
As journalists, we knew the amount of time and access the backpacking trip afforded us to Smith was priceless.
We carried everything we needed in heavy backpacks – camp stoves, tents, sleeping bags, water filters, bear spray, first aid, bags of dehydrated food, layers of clothing, whiskey. On top of the normal backcountry essentials, we carried one set each of recording equipment like microphones, cables, headphones, recorders, wind screens and a seemingly endless supply of batteries, so that we could record our interviews and field notes. 
We packed two of every piece of equipment we needed in case something broke, got wet or got lost. 
Over the course of two days on (and off) the trail, Smith told us about wolves being brought back to Yellowstone.
He told us the return of wolves, as well as other predators like cougars and bears, have had a big overall ecological impact on Yellowstone.
Smith talked about how when apex predators at the top of the food chain eat their prey, that can have an effect down the line on the food the prey eats, as well.
Smith told us that without wolves and other predators, the Yellowstone elk population boomed and elk would destroy stands of Aspen trees and other vegetation by grazing. 
With wolves and other predators back on the landscape, elk needed to keep moving and couldn’t risk staying in one place, grazing until the local vegetation was depleted. 
As we hiked, Smith stopped to point out small young Aspen trees that were starting to grow back after wolves were reintroduced.
Smith told us about the history of wolves in Yellowstone, and about capturing wolves to place radio collars on them to make them easier to track and study. 
He also told us about the controversy that surrounds wolves and some of the poaching and torture of wolves that he has seen.
We included information Smith shared with us in the first, third and fifth installments of both the Howl podcast and written series.

 How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped up to lead wolf management in Idaho 

One of the most appealing aspects of Howl was also one of the aspects we knew the least about going into the project. 
Both of us have lived in Idaho for about 20 years, but were kids living in other parts of the country when wolves were reintroduced in the 1990s.
As journalists we knew that the Idaho Legislature didn’t want anything to do with wolf reintroduction.
But we didn’t really know much about how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped up to lead wolf management in Idaho for more than decade. 
We also realized that if we didn’t know that story after years of reporting news that many people in Idaho outside of the Tribe might not know the story either.

We decided to learn as much of the history as we could, which led us to Lapwai, Idaho, and the Nez Perce Reservation in July 2024.
We met with Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler, who told us about some of the Tribe’s traditions, stories and connections to wolves.

During that trip, we met with Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as the natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Separately, Druzin interviewed biologist Marcie Carter, who served on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf project beginning in 1997 and now serves as the watershed coordinator for the Tribe.
Druzin also interviewed Allen Pinkham, a Nez Perce elder who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham told Druzin. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
We used the second episode of the Howl podcast and written series to share what we learned from members of the Nez Perce Tribe. 
Another extremely valuable source for Howl was Suzanne Asha Stone, the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and the Wood River Wolf Project. After originally starting as an intern, Stone was a member of the wolf reintroduction team that brought wolves back 30 years ago.
Stone shared a first hand account of the day wolves were reintroduced to Idaho, described the controversy and politics surrounding wolves and shared her research into nonlethal tools to help ranchers and herders protect their livestock from wolves.
We cited information Stone shared in four episodes of Howl.
  Spotting wolves in the wild in Yellowstone 

We did see wild wolves in the course of reporting Howl.

One morning last summer we woke up at a campground just outside of Yellowstone before 4 a.m. to meet Rick McIntyre, the man who has seen more wolves in the wild than anyone in the world.
McIntyre is a veteran wolf watcher, author and former Yellowstone National Park ranger who agreed for us to meet him near Slough Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone National Park.
Each morning before dawn, McIntyre and dozens of wolf watchers gather in and around Yellowstone’s Lamar Valley for a chance to see wolves in the wild. With decades worth of near daily wolf sightings under his belt, McIntyre knows the location of the park’s wolf packs and many of the details of the lives of individual wolves.
Because wolves are afraid of people, McIntyre and other wolf watchers use high powered wildlife spotting scopes that look like telescopes to watch wolves safely from a distance.
(Yellowstone National Park requires visitors to stay at least 100 yards away from predators like wolves and bears).
That July morning, McIntyre extended his arm and offered us a peek through his spotting scope, just as he has to thousands of Yellowstone visitors over the past 30 years.
Through McIntyre’s lens we saw wolf 907F, the long reigning alpha female leader of the Junction Butte Pack, playing with her 10th and final litter of pups. 
Last summer, 907 was the oldest known wolf in Yellowstone, and had given birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone.
McIntyre and veteran wolf watcher Laurie Lyman shared 907’s story with us, which resonated particularly with Corbin. 
The day we left Yellowstone after interviewing McIntyre and Lyman, Corbin knew he wanted to write 907’s story.
It took five drafts that were completed between December and April, but 907s life story became part three of the written series of Howl, Fixing Yellowstone.

 Through ups and downs, reporting Howl was a great assignment 

The morning we met McIntyre we got up so early that we beat him and all the other wolf watchers to Slough Creek, which inadvertently led to one of the most bizarre things we witnessed during the entire course of reporting and writing Howl.
As we were leaving our campground at 4 a.m., there was only one other camper up and moving around.

He appeared to be still up, as opposed to just waking up like we were, and he was standing next to his car a short distance away from our vehicle. 
As we sat in our vehicle Druzin turned on his recorder and began narrating. 
“OK, It’s one minute until 4 in the morning,” Druzin said.  
Just then the man turned around, bent over and began fidgeting with something in his car. 
Corbin instantly burst into uncontrollable laughter, ruining Druzin’s audio and breaking one of the major rules of audio journalism – shut up when you’re recording.
We couldn’t help it though. 
The man’s entire, extremely large backside was entirely exposed as he bent over.
A complete and total stranger appeared to be mooning us.
Luckily, the audio recording of our reaction survives, beginning with sustained giggling.
“Well the guy’s ass is hanging out as he’s loading up his car at the campground,” Corbin said.
“We saw a full moon,” Druzin interrupted. 
“And it’s not just like a little bit,” Corbin said.
“No,” Druzin agreed. 
“It’s like he did it on purpose,” Corbin said. “…. It was all visible.”
“I would say that there was very little that wasn’t visible,” Druzin said. “Left nothing to the imagination.”
The, ahem, full moon at the crack of dawn story sums up reporting Howl as well as any other moment.
Even when getting mooned, we kept a sunny disposition every minute of working on Howl.

Prism Logistics has asked a judge to review the state's recent decision to deny several lease renewals.
The post Gravel operator digs in with another lawsuit to open Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a controversial gravel pit at the base of Casper Mountain wants a judge to review the state’s recent decision to deny several lease renewals.
Casper-based Prism Logistics filed a petition for judicial review Monday in the 7th District Court in Natrona County, claiming the state’s denial was “contrary to law” because the company had met conditions qualifying for an extension, according to the filing.
Pointing to statute regarding leases and lease extensions on state-owned lands — 36-6-101 sections (b), (m) and (n) — Prism contends the state “shall” grant an extension if any one of four criteria are met. “We believe that we clearly complied with two of the four,” Prism Manager Kyle True told WyoFile on Tuesday. “So we’re asking a judge if we’re reading the law correctly.”
How we got here

The Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners in 2023 granted eight exploration leases to Prism to potentially mine gravel on several state-owned “school trust sections” at the base of Casper Mountain on the town’s west side. Neither the county nor nearby residents in the Coates Road area were notified, and neighbors were aghast to learn about the leases after inquiring about test-digging in the area early last year.
The board, composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines, unanimously approved the lease applications via a consent agenda (without direct review or discussion).
It set off a firestorm of opposition, prompting county officials to install heavy truck limitations and rezone the area to forbid commercial mining, as well as a political storm on the state lands board.
Six of Prism’s eight leases came up for renewal in June. Only Meier opposed a motion to deny renewing the six leases, and Gordon declined to vote. Racines, who brought the motion, said Prism did not move forward in adequate time with state licensing and permits.
The other two leases come up for renewal in October.
Meantime, a judge has allowed Prism to continue to pursue its case against the Natrona County Board of Commissioners challenging whether the county can impose zoning regulations that prohibit state-sanctioned uses on school trust lands.
Asked whether Prism sees a path forward to eventually mine gravel in the area, True said “yes.” Although True initiated several public and private conversations with opponents and nearby residents, those overtures have not been returned lately, he said.

The exhibits cater to different learning styles — visual, auditory and hands-on — as well as different visitor types — skimmers, browsers and gorgers. They also feature lesser-known Equality State figures that even history buffs may not be familiar with. 
Take Lizabeth Wiley, for example, a bookseller who ran for Greybull mayor in 1924 to chase the Ku Klux Klan out of town. Wiley won and largely fulfilled her campaign promise. Her portrait now overlooks the Nellie Tayloe Ross Executive Conference Room in the west wing of the Capitol’s first level, now named Suffrage Hall. 
Another intention of the project is to make clear that the People’s House belongs to everyone. 
“These exhibits are more than beautiful displays—they are a powerful invitation for every Wyomingite to feel at home in their Capitol,” Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, said in a statement. “Through vivid storytelling, hands-on engagement, and a celebration of our proud firsts, we’re ensuring that every visitor walks away with a deeper sense of belonging and a renewed pride in our state’s rich legacy and leadership.”
Landen co-chaired the Capitol Square Interpretive Exhibits and Wayfinding Subcommittee with State Auditor Kristi Racines, alongside State Treasurer Curt Meier, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and Reps. Bob Nicholas, R-Cheyenne, and Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, as members.

Having an equal split between the executive and legislative branches on the committee, Racines told reporters, required consensus building since nobody could overrule anyone else. 
Thursday’s opening, which falls on Wyoming Statehood Day, features a variety of free activities, including guided tours, history talks, a theatrical performance and activities for children. 
From noon to 8 p.m., visitors are also encouraged to bring a picnic blanket or lawn chair to enjoy food trucks, music and military vehicle displays on the north side of the Capitol grounds. 
Guided tours will need to be reserved in advance online. A full schedule of events can be found here.

Columnist Rod Miller recounts this memory to ridicule the goofiness of right-wing bathroom laws.
The post My night as a ‘woman’ appeared first on WyoFile .","I see that some transgender dudette used the ladies’ room in the Capitol building. Apparently, this was a protest against Wyoming’s recent anti-transgender law. Man (and I use that term advisedly), protests are waaay different today than when I was a rabble-rouser. Micturation as a form of political protest was never on my Bingo card.

Opinion

When I saw this news, I was reminded of two things. First is Edward Abbey’s quote about bladder relief, “If a man can’t piss in his own front yard, he’s livin’ too close to town.” I’m not sure why this adage jumped to mind when I saw this blatant violation of answering nature’s call. Maybe just because I’ve always respected Abbey.
The second memory this event prompted was the night that I dressed up as a woman and went out on the town. Deuteronomy 22:5 notwithstanding, I had a great time!
You must be asking yourself why a macho jock-cowboy like yours truly would cross-dress and risk the fires of hell where the flames are not quenched and the worm dieth not. I did it for fun and charity, and here’s how it happened.
I was living in Laradise a decade or so ago, and the annual Drag Queen Bingo extravaganza was approaching. Jasmine, a young artist who had done a couple portraits of my hirsute self, invited me to be her date.
Jasmine dressed like a Cuban pimp — pencil mustache painted on with eyeliner, slicked back pomaded hair and a sharkskin suit. I knew that, given my physical reality, I could never pass for a high-dollar hooker, so I dressed up as a barefoot and pregnant American housewife.
I duct-taped enough pillows to my belly to make me look like I was carrying triplets. I donned a ratty house dress, put curlers in my hair and beard, slapped on some lipstick, took off my Tony Lamas and I was ready for a night away from the kitchen.
Hell, Wyoming is 62 million acres of outdoor, uni-sex pissoir. Does the Freedom Caucus want to confine male urination to the Red Desert, and reserve the Bighorn Basin for the gals?Rod Miller
Along with the other gender-bent attendees, Jasmine and I played Bingo and drank beer into the wee hours. We raised a lot of dough for the Laramie women’s shelter, the downtown free clinic and other worthy causes. Old Testament laws were broken routinely, with no apparent consequences.
That is, until I had to take a leak. I waddled into the men’s room, out of habit more than anything. Stepping up to the urinal, I couldn’t see over the triplets and ended up peeing on my bare feet. That’ll teach you, I heard an ethereal voice say, to violate the natural order of things. The lesson was amplified when it took me a couple days to extract the curlers from my beard.
I recount this memory to ridicule the goofiness of right-wing bathroom laws. With all the critical issues facing us in the Big Empty — chemtrails, LDS steeples and road-killed grizzlies — legislators waste their time on who can pee where.
Hell, Wyoming is 62 million acres of outdoor, uni-sex pissoir. Does the Freedom Caucus want to confine male urination to the Red Desert, and reserve the Bighorn Basin for the gals?
Our “conservative” politicians need to loosen their bustles. If there’s anything that trumps their cherished Wyoming Values, it’s the fact that “when ya gotta go, ya gotta go,” and that pesky truism in our Constitution that says, “all members of the human race are equal.”
I might suggest that our Freedom Caucus folks get out on the town more, live a little and have some fun. I had a blast during my one cross-dressing experiment, and they may enjoy it as well.
If Rep. John Bear applied some J.D. Vance mascara and wore a slinky black cocktail dress and stiletto heels, he’d turn heads at a dry cleaners convention, and maybe make some spendin’ money.
Chuck Gray could pull off a cute pinafore and pink bows. If he tapdanced and hummed a few bars of “Good Ship Lollipop,” the crowd would go nuts.
Even Congresswoman Harriet Hageman could slip into a male persona and have a good time. If she lost the turquoise, then put on a bushy white dread-locked beard and an old Stetson, she could go as Rod Miller at Drag Queen Bingo.
The only thing cramping their style would be some jerkwater politician telling them which bathroom they had to use.

But Montana’s 1972 Constitution is also “traditional” in that […],"The main stairway to the third floor of the Montana Capitol building is seen on Wednesday, February 12, 2025. (Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana’s 1972 Constitution has been described by some as “progressive” and it was indeed written to move our state forward for “this and future generations.”  It provides Montana citizens with an expansive and inclusive bill of rights far surpassing any other state or the U.S. Constitution. But Montana’s 1972 Constitution is also “traditional” in that it enshrines “three separate but equal” branches of government – the legislature, executive and judicial – same as our 1889 Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. 
But prior to 1972, the Montana Legislature was not an “equal” branch of government. It was crippled – meeting only every other year for 60 calendar days with no power to do committee work or have staff beyond the days in session. 
Not surprisingly, most candidates running to be ConCon –Constitutional Convention– delegates, including me, campaigned on a platform of enhancing the power and role of the Legislature.
And those delegates constituting the Legislative Committee were united in the purpose of making the “peoples’ branch of government” first among equals. Former legislators serving in the convention knew all too well the limitations of the “pressure cooker,” as the legislature was commonly described. The 1972 ConCon provided for annual legislative sessions, interim committee work with staff and the ability to call itself into special session, which previously only the governor could do. 
The 1972 Constitution did not try to increase powers or aggrandize the role of Montana’s judicial branch because the role of the courts in reviewing and striking down legislation that violates the constitution has been a well-established judicial responsibility since the 1803 federal Marbury vs. Madison decision. The primary focus of the ConCon’s debates on the judicial article was how members of the judiciary were to be selected – through popular election or by merit-based appointment, the financing of Supreme Court elections, and the number of justices.  Supporters of judicial reform supported a “Montana Plan” for merit-based selection but the full convention stayed with the Montana tradition – elected judges – while increasing the number of justices from five to seven.
The legislature was granted all legislative power of the state except that reserved to the people – initiative and referendum. And the Constitution authorizes and directs the Legislature to implement many provisions of the Constitution. But the Constitution not only grants the legislature power, it also imposes limitations on it, in particular in the Declaration of Rights. 
The 1972 delegates had very high regard for the legislature and the legislative process. Nowhere is this more evident than in Article IX, Environment and Natural Resources. There the Constitution provides that the state and each person shall “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment for present and future generations,” which is also recognized as an inalienable or fundamental right. The Constitution charges the Legislature with implementing those fundamental protections. The Supreme Court can only determine the constitutionality and enforceability of legislation and must stop it from going into effect if unconstitutional. Deference is given to duly enacted legislation, except when legislation is challenged on the basis that it infringes on a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Then the court is required to exercise a different standard of review and scrutiny. When the Montana Supreme Court consistently rules that the legislature cannot ignore the Constitution, it is only fulfilling its primary responsibility.
The Supreme Court cannot legislate as the legislature can. The justices’ oath is to protect, uphold and defend the Constitution. If Montanans are really serious about protecting their right to a clean and healthful environment, they need to elect legislators, a governor and attorney general who will embrace, implement and enforce those rights in order to insure they are more than just words on paper.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 07:11:43.232713

Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
Idaho legislative committee studying housing hears about hardships in permitting, approval process

By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
 More U.S. states seal, expunge eviction records through laws, policy

Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”












I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger




The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises on expungement v. sealing eviction records

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.

“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Idaho joins other states enacting eviction records laws

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.












I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta




This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Photo: Somervilletn.org)The NAACP Legal Defense Fund on Monday dismissed its lawsuit challenging Fayette County’s 2021 electoral map as discriminatory after county lawmakers passed a new map that complies with the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution, the group stated.
The lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Tennessee in late February, claimed that the map adopted by the Fayette County Commission in 2021 was chosen “at least in part with the intent to racially discriminate against Black voters.” 
The Tennessee Comptroller’s local redistricting guide requires county legislative bodies to consider minority representation when redistricting. Black voters make up more than 25% of Fayette County’s population, but the 19-member county commission is entirely white. The lawsuit stated that the commission chose an electoral map in 2021 that diluted the power of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice.
The commission approved a redistricting plan that had no majority-minority districts — rejecting other plans that included districts with majority Black voting age populations — against the advice of outside legal counsel and the commission’s own redistricting committee. 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund sues Fayette County over ‘discriminatory’ 2021 electoral map

The U.S. Justice Department sued the Fayette County Board of Commissioners in January, also alleging that the board’s adoption of the 2021 map violated the Voting Rights Act. 
Fayette County rejected the allegations in the federal lawsuit and stated its characterizations were “unfounded,” but the county opted to review and revise the map, according to court documents.
Fayette County commissioners voted to reconvene the Redistricting Committee in April, instructing the committee to create a plan with “no less than two majority minority districts.” The committee held a public hearing for the new plan in May before recommending it to the commission for passage.
Fayette County asked the court to stay the federal lawsuit proceedings in April in light of those pending redistricting plans, the “singular purpose” of which was “to reconsider and replace the map at issue in this litigation,” court filings state.
The commission unanimously approved the new electoral map with three majority-Black, single-member districts on June 24. The new map will be used in the 2026 election cycle.
The federal lawsuit’s status is unclear, as the last court-ordered status update was submitted on June 23, one day before the Fayette County Commission adopted the new map.
“Our lawsuit sent a clear message that Fayette County has to treat everyone fairly in the map drawing process,” John Cusick, LDF Assistant Counsel, stated in a news release. “The new map is a huge victory for Black voters that only happened because of our clients’ courage and unshakeable determination to fight for full citizenship and equal rights. We look forward to the 2026 election cycle where Black voters will finally have a chance to participate equally in the democratic process.”
The Legal Defense Fund’s lawsuit represented the claims of the NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch and five Black Fayette County voters: Christine Woods, Thomas Gilmore, Veils Fitzpatrick, Willie Luellen and Marandy Wilkerson. 
“This passage of the new map is not just a victory for Black voters, but also a victory for Fayette County,” Woods, one of the plaintiffs, stated in the release. “I’m excited about the new map and look forward to the upcoming elections that will take place under a fair map. This is a great opportunity for Black voters to get out and make our voices heard so that we have equal representation on the County Commission.”

We rank 37th in the nation in doctor-to-patient ratio, and the situation is especially dire in rural areas. Of our 53 counties, 46 are federally designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas. These aren’t just statistics. Pregnant women are traveling hours for prenatal care. Mental health services are scarce, contributing to one of the highest suicide rates in the country. And half of our critical access hospitals are losing money, threatening to leave entire communities without lifesaving care.
This is a looming crisis, but we are not the only rural state facing these challenges. Other states have acted; we can learn from their experiences to see what works.
One place to start is residency training. North Dakota has the lowest number of residency training slots per medical student in the country. This forces most of our medical school graduates to leave to complete their training, and only 22% come back to practice. States like South Dakota and Pennsylvania have shown that doctors who train in rural areas are more likely to stay there to practice. By expanding the University of North Dakota rural residency programs, we can train more doctors in rural medicine and create a new pipeline in critically needed specialties like OB/GYN and psychiatry.
We should also take a fresh look at our medical licensing laws. International medical graduates, doctors who have trained abroad and often specialize in high-demand fields, are currently required to repeat their multi-year residency training in a U.S. program. Tennessee and Utah have replaced this requirement with a path for international medical graduates to practice under supervision, which leads to a full medical license. North Dakota could do the same, and quickly boost the number of providers in areas with the greatest need.
At the same time, we can do more to empower the health care professionals who are already here. North Dakota has been a leader in providing full practice authority to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We can build on that success by extending it to other classes of health care providers. Idaho shows that granting prescribing authority to pharmacists to treat low-risk conditions allows patients in rural areas with no doctor to receive care for minor or chronic conditions that otherwise may go untreated.  Allowing trained psychologists to prescribe medications for mental health conditions has been successfully implemented in New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa and Idaho, and shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce the rate of suicide.
Finally, we can increase access to telehealth. Roughly one-third of North Dakota hospitals still lack basic telehealth technology. Even when technology is in place, current law requires doctors who see patients by video to have full North Dakota medical licenses, restricting access to out-of-state specialists. When Vermont started issuing simple telehealth licenses to out-of-state providers, wait times for specialist care dropped by 200 days. North Dakota could follow suit, making it easier for rural patients to connect with the care they need.
The physician and specialist shortage is already straining our health care system and threatening our public health and economic stability. But proven, practical solutions would improve access to medical care for everyone in the state, especially for rural North Dakotans. If we want to protect our way of life, we need to make changes that bring medical care closer to the people who need it.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Doctor-stock-photo-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-07-09 06:07:12.708486

(Courtesy of Jeri Fry)Republicans’ tax break and spending cut bill signed by President Donald Trump last week includes a provision that could compensate some people exposed to radiation in Colorado. 
The bill extends and expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which provides compensation for medical bills to people in certain states who were exposed to radiation because of nuclear testing and weapons development. 
The original RECA expired last year, and the version approved as part of the “big, beautiful bill” includes coverage for uranium miners and workers in Colorado and other Western states.

RECA was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests and to those who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. More than 100 atmospheric weapons tests were conducted in the U.S. and its territories between 1945 and 1962, resulting in widespread radioactive fallout across much of the U.S.
Colorado residents have filed 3,709 claims for compensation under RECA, 2,688 of which were awarded, according to U.S. Department of Justice data. That has led to over $245 million in compensation for Colorado residents from the federal government. Data is based on the state where an applicant currently resides, not necessarily the location where they were exposed to radiation.  

The Western Governors’ Association wrote to Congressional leadership at the end of June encouraging them to reauthorize RECA. 
“Western Governors support maintaining and funding RECA and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, expanding them to more accurately include the affected populations of downwind states and defense production workers, and extending them to ensure that individuals receive compensation for the effects of these national security radiation exposures,” the letter said. 
U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, has championed the extension of RECA.
The program’s new expiration date is Dec. 31, 2028.

(Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)On a Tuesday afternoon, Michelle Allen is in her office in an empty Robert C. Byrd High School. Allen is the career and technical instructor at RCB and also runs GameChanger, the school’s prevention education club.
In an empty classroom, Allen walks over to a desk where a three-ring binder sits. It contains about 25 pages of materials that GameChanger has provided, including a theme for each month and suggested activities, many of which come from other national prevention education programs, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
“This year, we were given a framework of each month to focus on a different topic,” Allen explains of the materials in front of her. “I just kind of use Google and research and find things that go along with that message.”

GameChanger is a statewide prevention education program founded in 2018, with the goal of having a chapter in every school in the state by the 2026-2027 academic year. The nonprofit’s founder, Joe Boczek, started the program after his then-college-aged daughter experienced an opioid addiction. 
“I know firsthand what families go through when you’re fighting addiction. That was what it was, the impetus behind GameChanger with me,” he said.
According to tax documents, GameChanger is a million-dollar-a-year organization. Their funding comes from the business community, the government and private companies, according to Boczek. But they are also being funded by a new source of money: global opioid settlement funds. 
Youth prevention education is one of the seven approved areas of spending of these settlement funds, defined in a 2022 Memorandum of Understanding from the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. 
An analysis of Freedom of Information Act responses from 50 of the state’s 55 counties shows six county commissions have put money towards youth prevention: Harrison, Jackson, Marion, Marshall, Mason and Mingo. 
So far, GameChanger has received $310,000 from three counties — more than any other existing prevention program — and Boczak says they intend to ask other counties to fund their work from this source as well. 
But prevention experts say the program lacks a research-backed curriculum, has no measurable outcomes to show — despite being around for eight years — and may ultimately fail to deliver on its promises to protect young people from addiction. Boczek says he’s willing to listen.
How GameChanger landed opioid settlement money in two West Virginia counties
Marion County was the first to award GameChanger opioid settlement funds. The money comes from a global settlement agreed to in 2021 by states, counties and cities across the country who sued opioid distributors, manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies over the nation’s overdose crisis. The settlement distributions will continue over the next 17 years, but as of April 15, Marion County reported via email it has received $960,890.78.
GameChanger’s application for financial support in Marion County came in the form of a special funding request and video presentation given in person to the county commission in May of 2024, according to meeting minutes. Presenters included GameChanger Executive Director Bozcek and Lance Puccio, who was representing program Chairman Larry Puccio, a well-known lobbyist and political operative in the state.
After the presentation, the three-member board of elected officials voted to award GameChanger $270,000 to implement their prevention education program in six schools in Marion County over the next three to four years. 
Marion County Administrator Kris Cinalli said the county commission asks for proposed activities tied to specific funding amounts in its opioid settlement request form, detailing how GameChanger would spend the allotment. However, in the GameChanger request, the only activity listed is the program itself, with no additional cost breakdown. 
According to Bozcek, the funding will cover implementation costs.
“We’re right in the midst of figuring out how we’re going to appropriate it. It’s all through the programming, and it cannot be used for anything else other than Marion County Schools,” Bozcek said.

Boczek says his program isn’t free, but the cost isn’t consistent across counties or even schools. Some schools receive subsidies from their county board, state or federal dollars, and even support from outside organizations or businesses that help pay for the programming. Just how much it costs each school, Boczek said, is information he is not ready to make public.
Mason County also awarded global settlement funds to GameChanger, but the effort to fund the program was led by teachers. 
Tracie Price and Scarlett Enos — Point Pleasant Junior/Senior High School’s GameChanger coaches — along with several students approached the Mason County Commission to request financial support for the program at their school. According to Price, one of the county commissioners is a teacher at the vocational center and talked to Price and Enos about coming and doing a presentation. 
Instead of filling out an application for review, like some counties require, Price says the students gave a presentation to the county commission during a regular meeting. The three-person elected commission then awarded their program $10,000. 
“They presented a PowerPoint of the things we’d done so far, some of the future goals that they had planned for the following year, some items that we would maybe need to purchase as we went to elementary schools for presentations,” Price said.
According to meeting minutes, Price and Enos have been present with students to give updates on the program to the commission. Price said they have used money to buy swag, a commercial to air during football games, guest speakers’ travel expenses and supplies for events, like posters. They have also attended events such as the West Virginia Prevention Day at the Capitol and the Mason County Youth Expo. 
From marketing pitch to school program

Before he founded the organization, Boczek worked in marketing. His clients included MVB Bank, which was a corporate sponsor of the West Virginia Secondary Schools Activity Commission. This led to a relationship between Boczek, MVB CFO Don Robinson and Bernie Dolan, the former executive director of the WVSSAC. The three of them came up with the idea for GameChanger together as a way to “get more bang for our buck,” Boczek said.
After its inception and in its first few years, the program garnered key endorsements from several West Virginia politicians, including former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, former Sen. Joe Manchin and now GameChanger chair Larry Puccio. Several celebrities have also participated in promotional events and videos later shown to schools, including Jennifer Garner, Brad Paisley, Nick Saban and Tim Tebow. 
Most of these celebrities make appearances at GameChanger’s annual Golf Classic hosted at The Greenbrier resort, owned by Justice’s family. The $500 individual ticket to the prevention education dinner and golf tournament helps raise awareness and money for the program. GameChanger does celebrate an educator at the event each year; however, no students or other teachers involved in the program attend, according to Boczek. The 2022 Golf Classic cost roughly $470,000, according to tax documents. 
GameChanger is described as a K-12 peer leadership program, where older students form relationships with younger kids and help them learn healthy habits. In the fall of 2022, it was piloted in 12 schools in the state.
The teachers and guidance counselors who oversee GameChanger at a given school are called coaches. Coaches work directly with the students to help run events or hold meetings, where many say they show videos about drug misuse and prevention. Coaches are paid an additional $5,000 per year for the position, which is covered by the school district. Each school is also given $500 to use on programming materials and events, which is provided by GameChanger. 
Boczek, whose wife is a teacher, said that paying the coaches an extra stipend was important to him because he believes many are overworked and underpaid. 
Katie Yeager, a guidance counselor at Lincoln High School in Harrison County, was among the pilot group of GameChanger coaches. Yeager says, even with the additional pay, no one applied for the job at her school. 
“They posted it, and no one at our school applied,” Yeager said. “So the principal approached [the guidance counselors] and said, ‘Would you please be willing to be the GameChanger coaches?’”
Yeager took on the role and began sharing videos and PowerPoints created by GameChanger with students, once in the fall and once in the spring during her first year. However, Yeager says she soon realized there is no set curriculum, and it is up to each coach at each school to plan lessons for their students. This leaves most of the work to the coaches and inconsistencies in programming across schools based on the time and effort each coach commits.
“There’s no real curriculum. We’re kind of allowed to do whatever we feel would be most beneficial for our school,” Yeager said. “The prevention specialist came in and talked with us. They trained our peer leaders, and then we were kind of just left to do whatever we feel is right.”

RCB’s coach Michelle Allen, also located in Harrison County where the county commission awarded GameChanger $30,000 in October 2024 according to Freedom of Information Act documents, noted the binder with the monthly themes came in her second year of leading her school’s club. 
North Marion High School in Marion County started its GameChanger organization in 2022.
“Our group is a student-powered substance misuse prevention group… and our job is really just to educate other students and let them know that not all students are using drugs,” Kaitlyn Knight, GameChanger coach at NMHS, said. “Not all students are vaping. Not all students are drinking. So it’s a peer leadership group that just leads by example.” 
But not every student in the 700+ person school receives the lessons because, much like Lincoln and RCB, they’ve set it up as a club.
“They just sign up. If they think that this would be something that they’re good at and that they like to do, sign up for it,” Knight said.
Superintendent of Marion County schools Donna Heston confirmed GameChanger is already in three schools — an elementary, middle and high school — in her county. Their implementation came before GameChanger was awarded $270,000 in opioid funds from the county commission in 2024.
“When we first started, we started with a high school because of the design of the GameChanger program, where you have students who are mentoring younger students about avoiding habits or giving them a space where we can get out of some of those generational problems that we have in society,” Heston said. 
Ellijah Armour, a 2024 graduate of NMHS, joined GameChanger in his junior year because he wanted to be a mentor for younger kids, especially his niece. 
“I wanted to show her a good example of why not to use [substances],” Armour said. “I want [mentor] students to know that their words are powerful to the kids and understand that anything you say could impact them.”
Part of GameChanger’s mission, according to its website, is to help schools comply with Laken’s Law, also known as the Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Education Act. Passed by the West Virginia Legislature in 2024, the law requires students to be taught about “fentanyl, heroin, and opioids awareness, prevention and abuse” and Narcan, the name brand for naloxone — a drug that can reverse an opioid overdose. 
According to the GameChanger, 229 middle and high schools and nearly 180,000 students are receiving instruction through the program, but in a spreadsheet made available on their website, multiple schools are listed more than once. Calhoun Middle/High School, with its 400 students, is listed twice, for example. Point Pleasant High School, with its 1,000 students, is listed three times. 
When asked for a list of the schools and counties that the program is currently being taught in, Boczek was unable to give a definite answer, saying, “We are currently assembling that for the new school year because more schools are being added, so I am not sure when that will be available.” 
Critics question GameChanger’s impact, scientific rigor
Although the research is 20 years old, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports 80% of American kids participated in some form of prevention education program in their school, but only 20% were exposed to effective prevention programs.
Alfgeir Kristjansson, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at West Virginia University and co-director of the West Virginia Prevention Research Center, says that’s because many of the drug prevention programs that are implemented in schools are there to check a box. 
“Schools, of course, are notoriously busy places… and their mission is to educate our kids,” Kristjansson said. “So what tends to happen in these kinds of scenarios is that they will incorporate what is the easiest thing for them to do. And those are usually structured programs.”
Schools have traditionally paid for short-term programs that come with pre-packaged material. D.A.R.E. — Drug Abuse Resistance Education — is perhaps the most well-known of these. Research published in the early 2000s found more than $750 million had been spent on the school-based program nationally, but the program was ineffective — students were no less likely to use drugs after completing D.A.R.E. than if left to chance. 
“And then we can check the box. Prevention done this year. Let’s move on to the next thing,” Kristjansson said.

But effective evidence-based prevention education Kristjansson says can have “enormous” economic impacts. SAMHSA found every $1 spent on effective school-based programs can save $18 on health care and other services later. Kristjansson says it can also delay substance use for young people and reduce their participation in other risky behaviors.
“Kids that start smoking and drinking and vaping and things of that nature later, let’s say at the age of 16 as opposed to the age of 14 or 13, they are also much less likely to drop out of school, engage in teen parenting and get into trouble with the legal system,” Kristjansson explained. “So in other words, there’s all kinds of related benefits from delaying substance use onset.” 
Effective prevention education, according to Kristjansson and his experience with international prevention research, is not solely left to schools and educators to handle, but is something that is structurally embedded into a community. He is an advocate of the Icelandic model, which partners with local leaders to identify community-based risk factors and, instead of just teaching kids not to do drugs, works to build healthier communities that support them through the difficulties of growing up and provides them with positive adult role models and alternative, healthy activities.  
“The best way to facilitate the initiation of drug use among kids is to give them almost nothing to do and bring very little social support to them,” Kristjansson explained. “There are two major problems that we have in West Virginia. One is what we call lack of parenting. There are just so many kids that grow up in challenging homes and challenging circumstances or with absent parents. And the second is what I broadly refer to as lack of opportunity. There are so many kids in our state that go home after school into nothingness.” 
“And in the meantime, while this is happening, they are going through the challenges of puberty,” Kristjansson continued. “We are telling them, go out and take risks, find your own way, do whatever you want. So it shouldn’t be surprising that society is sort of like a grinder. If I don’t provide almost anything to you, surely you’re going to be more likely to engage in risky behavior.”
Kristjansson said he had a few meetings with Boczek as GameChanger was being developed and advised him that the program needed real, research-based prevention. 
“I have the utmost respect for him with regards to his ability to market things and to acquire funding and to be visible and out there. He clearly is a very good marketer,” Kristjansson said. “But I told him — I told him very clearly, exactly what I am telling you now — big time bling and rock stars and events are not prevention.” 
“To bring in Hollywood stars to do some bling events in town halls, let me tell you what the kids find about these is that this is fun. You’re bringing fun to them,” Kristjansson said. “You bring something like GameChanger through the schools with the logos and the bling, again, it’s fun. It’s a breakup in the day. They will have the ability to move out of a class for a reason. But it has no effect on prevention.” 
Kristjansson said there are too many people without expertise getting into prevention.
“Let me just put this straightforward: There is absolutely nothing that indicates that GameChanger is making an impact. Absolutely nothing,” Kristjansson said. 
Michael Hecht, a professor emeritus of communications at Pennsylvania State University and president of Real Prevention LLC, said it is uncommon for an individual under 15 to overdose or interact with opioids, but they are not a new topic for youth prevention education programs. There have been questions, though, about what information about specific substances is appropriate for different age groups.
“Opioids are tough because if you’re talking about like a middle school or even a high school, the usage levels are fairly low,” Hecht said. 
Hecht created keepin’ it REAL, a drug prevention program that began as a small research project in the 1990s and now reaches more than a million youth annually in all 50 states and 20 countries. The program’s growth led to the creation of Real Prevention, which Hecht said uses federal grants and contracts to create health promotion programs for schools, communities and other organizations working in health care spaces, like the American Cancer Society. 
Hecht’s programs use digital tools like apps and video games to address public health issues ranging from substance use to HPV vaccination. His research and resulting programs were used to overhaul and relaunch the D.A.R.E. program.
“It’s very narrative. It’s about stories, it’s about risk and decision making and social emotional learning,” Hecht said of the new D.A.R.E. programming.
Hecht says research shows programs for young people that focus on social-emotional learning and “develop core basic competencies in kids that tend to make them resilient and healthy” are the most effective.
“They use a prevention theory that’s based on modeling and narratives, and they avoid information fear,” he explained.
Hecht reviewed GameChanger materials and information to provide an analysis of its programming. 
“I would never choose a program like that because, I’m not saying that there isn’t a kid somewhere that it won’t help, but if you’re looking to increase your odds about having an effect, this program has got very low chances, in my opinion, of succeeding,” Hecht said.

Hecht says the program relies on pledges and fear-based messages that research has proven don’t improve outcomes for students. GameChanger also has not made public or included in its opioid settlement funding requests details for how it will measure its impact or success. 
“It’s not going to move the dial on changing social norms, teaching them social skills, you know, any of the kinds of things that we know are needed for substance use prevention,” he said. “Too many people are marketers or advertisers that get into the field and you recognize their programs as messages immediately because they’re glitzy but have no prevention theory behind them, really, other than fear.”
However, Hecht acknowledged that GameChanger is still a new program. 
“I think they’ve come to realize that they need a stronger prevention focus in the messages they’re sending out, that they tend to be kind of glitzy, they tend to fall into that marketing and advertising domain,” Hecht said. “And so they’re likely to maybe capture the kids’ attention, but I don’t know if they’ll go much beyond that now.”
“The reality is, if you don’t have engagement, you don’t have anything anyway. So it’s a step in the right direction. It’s the beginning. But as far as having a prevention theory or something like that, I don’t think it’s really there.”
Beyond the checkmark: Building sustainable prevention programs in West Virginia
Boczek acknowledges the critiques of his program’s scientific rigor and says that becoming an evidence-based program takes time — admitting that the process is taking longer than he initially thought. However, he said GameChanger is working to improve.
“If there’s ever been a kryptonite to GameChanger, it’s been an evidence-based question. It’s a working process that you have to cross every ‘T’ and dot every ‘I,’” he said. 
Boczek also acknowledged the lack of outcome tracking in the current iteration of the program. GameChanger intends to measure its success by tracking students, he explained. They want to track younger classes until their high school graduation and measure if they use any substances during that time. 
Hartley Health Solutions — a health consulting firm whose mission is to “improve community health outcomes through tailored, innovative consulting that addresses the specific needs of underserved-populations” — began working with GameChanger in January to develop more evidence-based programming and potentially help track outcomes. It is staffed by Ph.D.s in nursing, behavioral and social science, and epidemiology. 
“When I got to look closer at their materials, I said, if you really want to kind of level up with your programming, you need to develop the science. You need to use behavioral change theories and conduct intervention mapping,” Summer Hartley, the firm’s president, said. “You can work towards encouraging students to have a behavior change, not just education and awareness.” 
Hartley said the new programming her team has been developing will be implemented in the fall of 2025 in elementary, middle and high schools. It will be a standard model, she said, that every coach will use no matter the grade level they’re teaching. 
“Every coach will be handed an implementation guide, and students will get programming guides,” Hartley said.  
“We’re going to be evidence-informed, which is a step in the right direction,” Boczek said of the coming changes. 
Boczek said he has also begun conversations with Hecht to help GameChanger move from “evidence-informed” to evidence-based. Those conversations began after both were contacted to speak for this story, according to Boczek and Hecht.
“Dr. Hecht is hugely interested in helping GameChanger because he loves our concept,” Boczek said. “We’ve had two calls with him, and are sending him all our information. He’s pointed out where we need to change a few things.”
“See, we don’t say right now we’ve got all the answers, and we know exactly 100,000% this is what we’re doing. We know what we’ve been able to accomplish, learn it on the fly, and we know what we will accomplish when we continue to associate people with people like Michael Hecht,” he said.
Boczek says GameChanger has been one of the hardest things he has done in his life. His own life experiences around the opioid crisis and the negative effect it has had on the state he calls home are his driving force. He is hopeful his work will leave West Virginia better than he found it. 
“I hope that in the next three years, I can step away and see it be evidence-based, see it moving into other states, seeing a very big time staff that’s highly educated Ph.D.s and prevention scientists working every day on the problem and addressing all the new findings, and making sure we keep up with all the new things that may come out that can do it better than we’re doing it now,” Boczek said. 
“I hope we’re better tomorrow than we are today. I hope we’re better next year than we are this year, and I certainly hope we’re better in five years than we are now.”

“Instead of making this change through the legislative process, the state instilled its anti-trans agenda through obscure, extralegal bureaucratic maneuvers,” the advocacy organization Trans Income Project wrote in a statement to the Illuminator. “Now, thousands of Louisianans are losing coverage for trans medicine and incurring unexpected out-of-pocket costs when attempting to pick up their regular prescriptions.” 
Gender-affirming care is a catch-all term for medical treatments given to people to align their physical bodies with their identified gender. Such care is administered to transgender people, who identify as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth, as well as cisgender people, who identify as their assigned sex.
The Louisiana Department of Health did not respond to emailed questions asking why the policy has been put in place. 
The Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA School of Law that researches sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates LGBTQ+ adults are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ+ adults to take part in the Medicaid program. 
Louisiana banned gender-affirming health care for transgender youth in 2023, but the treatments remain legal for transgender adults. 
The Williams Institute estimates about 15,700 transgender adults live in Louisiana. 
The Trans Income Project encourages individuals worried about paying for their prescriptions to reach out to the organization for assistance.

(Courtesy Indiana National Guard)After years on the decline, enlistment at the Indiana National Guard is on its way back up, and officials hope recent award and benefit changes will lead to further improvement.
Recruitment is up 14% over last year, according to Guard spokeswoman Lauren Houck. Air and Army members total of 12,173 members as of June 30.
At a closed ceremony Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Mike Braun ceremonially signed legislation, in effect July 1, that Adjutant General Larry Muennich previously said “will help address our challenges.”
Muennich also presented two Guard members with matching Indiana Distinguished Service Crosses for lifesaving actions — made possible by House Enrolled Act 1111.
Sgts. Justin Garrett and Taylor Watkins were at the Lawrence armory in September for a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps event with Lawrence Central High School when a 17-year-old girl’s asthma attack crossed into cardiac arrest. The duo performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived.

The award previously was exclusive to those who perform a dangerous “act of heroism” or “act over and beyond the call of duty.” A new provision — for those who “contribut(e) directly” to saving others’ lives through an “act of courage” — put Garrett and Watkins’ names to paper and pins on their jackets.
“We just wanted a nice way to award soldiers and airmen who do outstanding, life-saving work,” Houck said.
Another award’s criteria was also expanded and a new one, the Indiana Outstanding Airman or Soldier of the Year, was created.
The legislation also offers big benefits that the pair of recruiters said could sweeten the deal for prospective recruits.
Soldiers and airmen who are 21st Century Scholars can now use Guard grants to pay up to $5,000 for higher education room and board, plus other approved expenses, for two years. The Scholars program covers tuition to Indiana colleges for foster children and low-income Hoosiers who meet academic requirements.
Members who apply for Guard tuition supplement scholarships can also use those awards to pay for credentialing programs and apprenticeships for “in demand occupations” determined by the adjutant general and Department of Workforce Development.
“The tuition assistance is great,” Garrett said. “Obviously, that’s one of our biggest selling points. It just encourages the citizen-soldier aspect, which is, all in all, going to make our job easier to help bridge the gap between the military and the civilian side.”
Other changes go beyond education.
House Enrolled Act 1111 adds soldiers on state active duty to the definition of a state employee for death benefit and worker’s compensation laws.
It also increases the payout cap on reasonable funeral expenses to $20,000 from $8,800 and deletes detailed, guard-specific processes for injury claims.
Additionally, the legislation allows the adjutant general to provide health insurance for members ordered to state active duty. Current law only lets the officeholder provide allowances to cover insurance premiums.
“All these changes seem to be heading into the right direction for recruiting aspects,” Garrett said. “… We are here to take care of our soldiers. We’re not just here for one week of the month.”

More than $118 million for Tennessee schools and educational programs is in limbo after the Trump administration froze federal funding last week that had been approved by Congress. 
Withheld funds or potential cuts could heavily impact Tennessee education programs, where it’s primarily been used to pay for teacher development, after-school programs, and other child care initiatives.
In a statement, Memphis-Shelby County Schools district officials say 100 teacher and staff positions could be impacted if some $17 million is withheld.
The district planned to use more than $14 million of the impacted funds for teacher development and recruitment efforts across 38 positions, according to district budget proposal documents. Another $1.6 million was earmarked for English language learner support to supplement 46 school-based translators.
“While this situation presents significant challenges, MSCS is actively developing thoughtful contingency plans to minimize disruption and ensure students, families, and staff continue to receive the support they need,” the district said. “In the event the funding is not reinstated, the district may be required to make difficult decisions, which could include program adjustments or use of reserve funds intended to protect long-term financial stability.”
The Tennessee Department of Education hasn’t commented on the funding freeze or how it’s communicating developments to school districts in the weeks before Tennessee students return to the classroom, though other states have provided breakdowns of projected impacts on local schools. 
Congress approved the funding in March, and school districts expected the money to be released at the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1. The federal funding included $890 million for English language learners, $2.2 billion for teacher training, $1.4 billion for before- and after-school programs, and $1.3 billion for enrichment programs like college counseling nationwide.
A smaller pot of money — $375 million — was supposed to pay for academic support for the children of migrant farmworkers.
Several Democrat-led states have called for the funding to be released and have threatened legal action. The Trump administration has said the freeze is part of an ongoing review of federally funded programs.
An Office of Management and Budget spokesperson said its initial findings showed that grant funds have “been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” including issues around immigration, though the office did not provide Chalkbeat with any documentation of the allegations. 
In Tennessee, less than 2% of this federal funding allocation went to “migrant education,” according to a review by the Learning Policy Institute. The institute estimated Tennessee stands to lose more than $106 million under the freeze, slightly less than the $118.9 million total provided by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee who also sits on the Senate Education Committee.
Nashville Metro Schools did not receive any money last year from Title I-C, which funds migrant education, while MSCS was projected to receive less than $60,000 for the upcoming year, a tiny portion of the district’s $1.9 billion budget.
In Nashville, the district said it does not anticipate any immediate impacts on programming but is following the issue closely.
“These congressionally mandated programs support essential services for our students—including those who are learning English, need additional academic support, or benefit from extended learning opportunities—and help ensure we have effective educators in every classroom,” district spokesperson Sean Braisted said in an email. “We support efforts to fully fund these programs at or above previous levels.”
Child care advocates are raising alarms about the funding freeze’s effect on before- and after-school programs, which are vital in states like Tennessee with skyrocketing child care costs. Last week, Boys & Girls Club CEO Jim Clark warned the loss of 21st Century Community Learning Center funding, which supports extracurricular programs, could decimate hundreds of clubs across the country.
Tennessee received more than $23 million to support these programs last year, according to the AfterSchool Alliance, with about $3.2 million going to local Boys & Girls Clubs. Those clubs are not likely to close their doors but could be forced to pull back on programs such as additional tutoring and enrichment experiences.
Bart McFadden, the interim executive director for the Boys & Girls Clubs in Tennessee, said no clubs in the state are exclusively federally funded, and they will be able to withstand the freeze.
“This is a pause, and we don’t know what it’s ultimately going to mean as we get into the school year. We’re hopeful these funds are released,” McFadden said. “If they’re not, plans are in place to mitigate the impact so that our blue doors, as we call them, are open for kids.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal magistrate judge Tuesday denied a motion from former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who asked to appear at an upcoming court hearing remotely from prison in Pueblo. 
Peters, a prominent far-right election denier, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a 2021 security breach in the elections office she oversaw. Peters has appealed the conviction. While the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, Peters has filed a federal habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado, arguing that she should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
The hearing, scheduled for July 22, is set to focus on the habeas corpus petition, in which Peters’ attorneys say that “since she has been incarcerated, her health has deteriorated.”
Peters’ attorneys said in the motion that she wanted to attend the July 22 hearing because the issues being discussed “affect her liberty interests.” Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak’s decision Tuesday precludes her from doing so.

During Peters’ sentencing in October, 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett said Peters had done “immeasurable damage” to local elections and trust in the electoral process. Peters was convicted by a jury in August on three felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position.
Peters’ case has garnered national attention and President Donald Trump has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
“Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on May 5.
On May 12, the Department of Justice asked for records from Colorado related to the 2024 and 2020 federal elections, as NPR first reported. Some election officials, including Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, believe the request is tied to the Peters case.

Sharpe, Jr. Hospital in Weston, W.Va. (Kristian Thacker | West Virginia Watch)As West Virginia continues to struggle with a lack of community-based homes for people with disabilities, the operating cost of a state psychiatric hospital is rising.
William R.Sharpe Hospital, located in Weston, is estimated to cost $128.7 million this fiscal year – up more than $9 in operating costs from last year. The price includes the hospital’s Transitional Living Facility.
“Sharpe Hospital, like most state psychiatric hospitals, has minimal reimbursement,” said Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Department of Health Facilities, which operates seven facilities, including two psychiatric facilities.
The department is continuing to develop additional community placements for people with disabilities, she added.
Community placements are much cheaper for the state. And, not every patient needs the level of restrictive care in a psychiatric hospital.
Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia, said that over the last eight years, Sharpe had operational financial losses of $671 million in taxpayer money.
“The daily institutional cost per patient is roughly $900 per patient [per day],” Folio said. By contrast, he said, care for a patient in a community setting, like a home with appropriate staff, would be around $300 per day.
Taxpayers are covering the loss, he said, while “fear of this population” keeps state leaders from prioritizing putting people with disabilities in community-based settings. 
The state has the nation’s highest rate of people with disabilities, and the number of patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities being held at state psychiatric hospitals has nearly tripled over the last decade. 
West Virginia Watch has reported on numerous problems at Sharpe Hospital, including patients saying they were wrongfully held in the acute care facility without treatment plans. There was a string of arrests in 2023 involving contract nurses who worked there. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey named his own secretaries of the state health department and Department of Human Services; he opted to keep Sec. Mike Caruso over DHF. Caruso was appointed by former Gov. Jim Justice. 
Folio says transparency has improved at DoHS, but it’s still difficult to get information about how patients are treated at Sharpe. 
“Many of the same problems at Sharpe that existed before continue,” Folio said. “There’s still an undercurrent of concealment and retaliation.”
Lawmakers recently toured the Sharpe during June interim meetings in the area, however, the tour was closed to the media – a decision made by DHF. Markham said the hospital is closed to the public in an effort to uphold patient safety and minimize disruptions.
“The purpose of the recent tour was to educate legislators and allow them the opportunity to understand operating procedures and ask questions while subjecting patients to the least amount of disruption. However, the department remains committed to transparency and offers any media outlet the opportunity to reach out with questions,” she said. 
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Weston, said he was thankful to have legislators and staff visit the hospital in his district.
“The reality is, operating a psych hospital can be both challenging and expensive, and the legislature wants to be sure we understand the complexity of the operations at Sharpe,” he said. “We are ready to assist the hospital’s efforts in providing the highest quality of care for its patients.”

Expensive contract workers account for 68% of Sharpe’s staffing 
Contract workers account for nearly 70% of the hospital staff at Sharpe. Earlier this year, DRWV filed a lawsuit against the state officials, saying contract workers had been permitted to harass and abuse patients and employees despite reports of their actions.
Markham said that in the past, contract and state-employed staff at the hospital have been terminated for a number of reasons, including substantiated internal investigations into patient treatment.
“The Department of Health Facilities takes patient safety and treatment very seriously,” she said. 
Folio said the state spent $100 million last year on contract workers at Sharpe.
An audit released in 2024 by the Legislature’s Post Audit Division showed the state spent $284 million since 2015 on contract nursing positions at its hospitals.
West Virginia, which has one of the nation’s lowest workforce participation rates, is struggling to fill full-time nursing jobs, which typically pay less than contract health care jobs.
From fiscal year 2015 to 2023, the total annual expenditure for contract clinical staff increased 955%, the audit found. 
A Justice-backed Medicaid reimbursement rate increase was meant to help hire more in-home staff who could help people with disabilities and others, but Folio said the change didn’t always translate into a pay raise for front-line workers. This has contributed to the shortage of community placements. 
DHF continues “to roll out initiatives to improve vacancy and turnover rates” to attract full-time staff, according to Markham. This year, the department has hired 152 state employees, and 88 of those were at Sharpe. The overall direct care vacancy rate at facilities has dropped 12% since January of last year. 
Morrisey’s administration continues to consider selling some state-run facilities. Cost is a driver in those conversations. 
“The Department of Health Facilities has continued to evaluate strategic options for the health care facilities, including Sharpe Hospital,” Markham said.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sharpe_KST_20231027_2853-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 06:07:12.708486

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.

Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Some advisory members raised questions about a recently published study regarding the current complaint system. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After years of inconsistencies and complaints, Virginia has moved closer to revising its process for reporting issues with special education services, aiming to improve the structure and ensure that families receive the necessary services for their students with disabilities.
The issues with the state’s dispute resolution system — an impartial procedure for parents and schools to resolve disagreements over issues with special education services — have created a divide among parents and public school leaders for at least the past five years.
As federal law states, Virginia is required to provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program. Last year, Virginia recorded over 185,000 students receiving special education services during the 2024-25 school year.
Wendy Little, a parent advocating for her son who is autistic, spoke on Monday to the state’s dispute resolution system advisory group as it reviewed a study with findings about the existing system and recommendations for bettering it. Her son’s story was a key inspiration for the formation of the advisory committee through successful legislation to address the system. She called for an overhaul of the current system to resolve problems special needs families face concerning their children’s education. 
“There is no resolution,”  Little said. “It’s a dispute to the parents and you get nowhere. It’s not only broken, it is completely corrupt.”
 A history of noncompliance

The system, which has been studied for the past five years, has been criticized by parents and advocacy groups for failing to monitor and respond to complaints raised by families. The situation reached a critical point when the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which looked into why the agency had failed to resolve complaints. 
“The time for continued study should end, and focus should turn to implementing the many reforms that have been offered throughout the years, and in this study,” said Deusdedi Merced, managing member for Special Education Solutions, LLC, which conducted the July 1 study. “The time to address the concerns of many is now. Only then will the full breadth of the protections afforded to students with disabilities on the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) will be realized.”
The report’s findings highlighted that dispute hearing officers did not meet standard legal practices. It also noted a public perception that VDOE has not effectively enforced the outcomes of investigations related to state complaint orders.

The findings align with a 2020 study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), which analyzes and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, regarding K-12 Special Education. 
In that report, researchers identified significant shortcomings in the state’s provision of special education services, including low-quality Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) — customized learning plans for student’s disabilities — a lack of knowledge among educators about how to effectively support students with disabilities, and shortfalls in VDOE’s oversight of local divisions.
JLARC’s study also found that the VDOE does not require school divisions to carry out corrective actions that fully and appropriately remedy instances of noncompliance.
The state education agency began turning things around starting with the Board of Education updating Virginia’s regulations on due process on March 28, 2024. Last December, the Office for Civil Rights wrote a letter closing its findings and requirements against VDOE.
 Next steps

Some of the draft recommendations the advisory group will be voting on to improve the system include training for all stakeholders compared to a select few, expanding data collection and improving special education mediation.
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, chair of the Virginia Commission on Youth, said she hopes the draft recommendations will provide more standardization of the IEP process, better training across the system for the mediators and the hearing officers, and increased clarity and support for parents. Favola, along with Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, carried legislation to overhaul special education in 2024.
“We’re trying to bolster the system in a way that makes it more responsive to the parents and ensures a certain amount of quality across the state and I think that’s going to be the message in the report that we go forward with,” Favola said.

But some committee members, including Favola, expressed concern about whether the recommendations could be met, considering the threat to resources and programs posed by federal funding cuts. VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said the agency will provide details about some of the cost impacts to special education at a future meeting.
The advisory group invited comments from the public, some of whom urged the committee to consider recommending a $10,000 cap on awards for parents, schools and hearing officers to reduce litigation costs. They also recommended better enforcement of federal laws, which includes the potential loss of licenses for non-compliance, and consistency across all divisions.
Kandise Lucas, an academic civil rights advocate, and parents also raised concerns about the mistrust the public has in Virginia’s public schools due to inconsistent eligibility determinations for students with disabilities and inadequate training across divisions.
“IDEA is a civil rights law that was created to make sure that children with disabilities are not marginalized; are not thrown away,” Lucas said. 
The advisory committee’s draft recommendations will be presented to the Virginia Commission on Youth on Sept. 3, and will be open for public comment until October 15. The commission will vote on these recommendations during its meeting on Oct. 21.

(Aristide Economopoulos /NJ Monitor)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars nationwide, especially in urban areas including Virginia Beach, Virginia, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.













Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University




Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire’s newly signed state budget will transfer nearly all money from the state’s Renewable Energy Fund to the general fund over the next two years, slashing investment in clean energy projects by roughly 50% from recent spending levels and forcing municipalities, school districts, and small businesses to compete for drastically reduced grant money. 
The budget, signed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte last month, redirects approximately $15 million in surplus funds and all incoming revenue — typically $3 million to $7 million annually — to the general fund through June 2027. Only $1 million per year will remain available for renewable energy projects, according to the bill’s language.
“You’re basically only spending a quarter of what you normally fund,” said Nick Krakoff, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. “There’s going to be a lot less money for these programs.” 
The cuts are a heavy pull in state support for renewable energy development at a time when New Hampshire already lags other New England states in clean energy deployment, according to Krakoff. While the fund was designed to distribute $4 million to $5 million annually, the Department of Energy had been spending only about $2 million in recent years while allowing a surplus to accumulate.
Advocates say the funding clawback was predictable, warning for years that chronic underspending was creating a tempting target for lawmakers facing budget pressures.
Shortfall victims
The Renewable Energy Fund accumulated a large surplus because the Department of Energy was spending only about $2 million annually despite more revenue flowing into the account each year through compliance payments that utilities make when they cannot meet renewable energy requirements.
That surplus grew to approximately $20 million, with about $15 million unawarded, before lawmakers moved to transfer the funds. 
The slashing will particularly affect municipalities and school districts that have relied on the renewable energy fund for heating projects and other clean energy upgrades, according to Krakoff. Many of these entities have tight budgets and would be unable to move forward with planned projects without state funding due to “very limited money as it is,” he said. 
The fund’s annual revenue, generated through the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, has fluctuated over the years. According to the state Department of Energy’s most recent annual report from November 2024, the fund received $1.3 million in 2009, $2.5 million in 2018-2019, and peaked at $7.3 million in 2022. 
Recent distribution patterns show the scope of the programs now at risk. In 2023, the fund doled out approximately $1.6 million for competitive grants to commercial and municipal projects, plus $1.3 million for residential rebates. The low-moderate income solar program alone received $1.6 million in 2024 — exceeding the entire $1 million annual allocation that will remain available moving forward.
The budget language is also creating ambiguity about which programs will survive. While the bill specifies that Class II funds (the $1 million annual) “shall not be used to support individual solar initiatives,” it also says that it “shall primarily be used to support solar energy technologies in New Hampshire,” making it unclear whether the latter applies to residential or only commercial and industrial projects. 
Even so, the residential solar rebate program had already been eliminated through separate legislation in 2024, not through this budget. The program had devolved into an ineffective lottery system where installers couldn’t guarantee customers would receive rebates.
Advocates actually supported eliminating the residential rebate requirement to redirect funds toward more effective programs like income-tested rebates for low-income residents. But the Department of Energy has delayed implementing replacement programs, contributing to the surplus that lawmakers ultimately raided. 
The department, which administers the funds, will now need to determine how to allocate the remaining $1 million among programs that previously required more than $4 million annually.
To meet in the middle
The final provisions scaled back House Republicans’ original proposal to eliminate the Renewable Energy Fund entirely. Initial budget language would have returned all fund money to utility customers as monthly rebates starting in 2027.  
A compromise came after pushback from senators and clean energy advocates who argued the cuts went too far, particularly Loudon Republican Sen. Howard Pearl, whose district includes hydropower plants that benefit from Renewable Energy Fund grants.  
However, House Republicans still preserved their broader agenda through standalone legislation. A retained bill, House Bill 224, would revive the proposal to rebate all renewable energy fund money to ratepayers beginning in fiscal year 2028. The rebates would operate similarly to existing Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative rebates that already provide customers with small annual credits. 
Provisions included in early iterations of the latest budget bill, before ultimately being scrapped, targeted the Renewable Portfolio Standard itself, which generates the fund’s revenue by requiring utilities to purchase renewable energy or make alternative compliance payments.
Rep. Michael Vose, the Republican chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, has previously defended the approach as necessary relief for ratepayers facing high energy costs.
The Ways and Means Committee will decide this fall whether to move forward with HB 224, given that the renewable energy fund will be “essentially depleted” by transfers to the general fund, Vose told the Bulletin on Tuesday. The committee could change the effective date to 2027, 2028, or later when the fund is no longer being used for general funding.
Vose supports returning money to ratepayers rather than the general fund, citing ratepayers being “constantly slammed with ever-increasing costs” for utility infrastructure maintenance. He also said that the transfer originated in Ayotte’s proposed budget in February, not as a legislative initiative. The governor’s office identified the $20 million to $21 million fund balance as available for general fund use beyond administrative costs, and “that was the plan all along,” according to Vose.
Others argue the cuts are counterproductive and eliminate a key tool for economic development and grid reliability. The funded projects help reduce electricity costs during, for example, recent heat waves when solar installations help “shave peak demand,” according Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs for Clean Energy New Hampshire. 
“Raiding the Renewable Energy Fund only stops projects that shrink electric bills,” Paul said. “Stopping those projects is not what is going to lower bills. Stopping them is what is going to raise bills.”
These projects also attract private capital investment that could be lost without state incentives, he noted.
At the same time, the fund transfer may even violate the New Hampshire Constitution by converting utility fees into taxes for general government purposes. A 2015 legal memo making this argument was written by Gordon MacDonald, who now serves as chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. 
That argument centers on the distinction between fees, which must be used for their intended purpose, and taxes, which can fund general government operations. The Renewable Energy Fund is generated through alternative compliance payments.
But the impact for ratepayers appears modest. Conservation Law Foundation calculations show eliminating the Renewable Energy Fund would reduce bills by approximately 33 cents monthly for average residential customers.
For now, projects already approved for renewable energy fund grants will receive their awarded money, though this commitment isn’t explicitly reflected in the budget language, according to Krakoff. New applications, however, will compete for severely limited resources until July 2027, when normal fund operations are scheduled to resume.
The two-year funding drought creates a window for New Hampshire’s renewable energy development to slow to a crawl before potential restoration — unless the Legislature passes standalone bills next session to make cuts permanent.
“There’s going to be continuing efforts to weaken or even eliminate both the Renewable Portfolio Standard and the Renewable Energy Fund,” Krakoff said, describing what he characterized as “anti-renewable animus,” from House Republicans.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/solarnhira-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

(Photo credit: CSPAN)As President Donald Trump revealed this week that 14 countries will face steep economic tariffs come August 1, a new poll funded by Catawba College’s Center for North Carolina Politics & Public Service finds many are questioning the president’s decision-making capabilities.
The poll of more than 1,000 North Carolinians conducted by YouGov, found that 46 percent of those surveyed lack confidence in the decisions the president has made regarding tariffs. Forty-one percent expressed confidence in Trump’s decisions.
Among self-identifying Republicans, 75 percent expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making on tariffs. But for Democrats it was exactly the opposite — 75 percent expressing no confidence. For Independent voters, 53 percent expressed a lack of confidence in the president’s decisions about his tariff policies, with fewer than one-third (31 percent) expressing confidence.
On inflation and the cost of living, 40% expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making with 46% saying they were not too confident or not at all confident. Predictably, those who identified as Republicans were more willing to support the president on the economy, Democrats less so. Among Independents, 57% said they were not confident in the Trump administration.
Trump found support in the Catawba-YouGov poll for his handling of immigration. Eighty-seven percent of Republicans were confident in Trump’s immigration policies, compared to 72% of Democrats who did not favor the decisions the president has made regarding immigration.
Last week, Trump toured a detention center in the Florida Everglades that has been dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility is viewed as a cost-effective solution for detaining undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Critics say the camp that can house up to 3,000 immigrants is unsanitary, and places those being held at great risk.

Again, the new poll underscores that North Carolina remains a purple state with voters split on how the president is moving forward in executing his agenda.
“So many of the topics garnered very close margins of those who expressed confidence versus those with a lack of confidence in the president’s ability to make decisions in his first six months in office,” said Dr. Michael Bitzer, director of the Center and professor of politics and history at Catawba College.
“While barely twenty percent of self-identified Democrats expressed confidence on any of the policies or issues asked, at least two-thirds of Republicans expressed confidence.”
Two areas where even Republican offered lower confidence scores in Trump’s decisions: defying court orders and bringing the nation together.
When it came to defying court orders, 61 percent of Republicans expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making. As for and bringing the nation together, just 63 percent of Republicans had confidence the president would be able to accomplish that. Collectively, factoring in North Carolina Democrats and Independents, only one-third were confident Trump could unite the nation.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The governor postponed her decision on a bill restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement until next year. Meanwhile, daily U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest rates have doubled in Maine since President Donald Trump took office, new data show. 
The Maine Legislature passed the proposal in June — by just one vote in the House of Representatives and seven in the Senate — after it was one of the most debated on the chamber floors and following considerable changes in committee to narrow its scope. 
The amended version of the bill, LD 1971, prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request but other restrictions — such as banning local authorities from providing office space for immigration authorities and limiting when state employees can inquire about a person’s immigration status — were removed.
With the Legislature now adjourned between its two-year session, Gov. Janet Mills opted to hold the measure until lawmakers return in January. Mills can then either veto the bill within the first three days of session or allow it to become law without her signature.
During public hearings, law enforcement authorities raised concern about the bill hindering federal partnerships that sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement task forces, which led bill sponsor Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland) to amend it so only work done by local police for the primary purpose of immigration enforcement would be banned. 
Mills understands the motivation behind the legislation to provide clarity to Maine law enforcement, her press secretary Ben Goodman said, but she believes it will do the opposite. 
“The bill is both overly broad and confusing, as it establishes a complicated legal regime of the type of interactions that are or are not permitted with federal law enforcement,” Goodman said in a statement.  
Maine Legislature passes restrictions on federal immigration enforcement

However, Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, believes the bill would provide necessary guardrails. 
“LD 1971 is about ensuring Maine’s state and local law enforcement aren’t using our limited taxpayer dollars to do civil immigration enforcement for the federal government and that they aren’t handing Maine residents over to immigration officers just based on their immigration status alone,” Roche said in a statement. 
The full extent to which state and local law enforcement are helping with immigration enforcement is not clear, but ILAP has tracked 17 traffic stops since March 2025 where such authorities have handed over at least 35 Maine residents and workers to immigration officers based on their immigration status. 
“While Maine’s state and local resources should not be wasted to investigate immigration status in any case, many of those impacted were known to be in a lawful immigration process, have a valid work permit, and no criminal record,” Roche said.
Immigration arrests increase in Maine 
ICE arrests in Maine have been increasing, particularly in recent weeks. 
Since Trump took office, ICE has arrested nearly 100 people in Maine, according to the Deportation Data Project. That’s about a 50% increase compared to 2024 numbers, according to the data collected through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against ICE brought by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Arrest rates in Maine and other states specifically surged in recent weeks, after Trump’s top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, demanded that ICE ramp up arrests to 3,000 people per day.
The vast majority of these recent arrests in Maine were not people convicted of a crime. According to the data, only about 20% were people convicted of a crime, whereas about 47% were people with pending criminal charges and 32% were people with immigration violations. 
These figures don’t include arrests made by U.S. Border Patrol, which hit a nearly 24-year high in Maine in April with more than 100 arrests in just that month. 
Immigration arrests have also increased nationwide, more than doubling in 38 states, according to the data. 
There is now more funding allocated to further ramp up immigration enforcement, with the federal budget Trump signed into law earlier this month securing more than $170 billion for this aim. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 new agents.
Formal agreements with immigration authorities
Wells community divided over ICE agreement with local police

Maine lawmakers opted to postpone until next year another related bill before it got a chance to be considered by the full Legislature. The Judiciary Committee carried over LD 1259, which seeks to explicitly prohibit state or local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Wells Police Department is the only Maine agency to contract with ICE under what’s called the 287(g) program, which Trump revived to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. While that agreement is still in place, the department has yet to decide whether or when it will act on it beyond training.
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam announced in early May a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under the program in light of the pending legislation. As of Tuesday, Putnam told Maine Morning Star officers had already completed the training for the program but had not yet been credentialed, which Putnam said meant they have not yet performed any of the functions allowed under the agreement. 
“Nothing has changed,” Putnam said. “Absolutely nothing has changed.”
In light of the two related bills being pushed off to next year, Putnam said she had not yet decided what that will mean for her officers’ participation in the program until then. “I’m not 100% sure how long they would hold the training for,” she said. 
If they start undertaking federal immigration enforcement, Putnam reiterated that Wells police would only enforce immigration detainers for people who are designated as “criminal aliens” if officers come across them in daily work, though the agreement permits broader enforcement. 
Wells Police Department remained listed as a participating agency in the program on the ICE website as of July 8.
Residents who’ve organized against the agreement are pushing for a permanent termination. After the pause on credentialing, they submitted more than 900 signatures to the town from Wells residents in favor of withdrawing from the contract.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case.


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)For 37-year-old Kyle Garvey, a typical day includes writing film reviews and doing some tutoring.
To do those things, the Columbus resident first needs to get out of bed.
Having had cerebral palsy since birth, that means having a home health provider to help him get out of bed, get dressed, eat meals, and anything else he needs during the day.
“It’s very basic life stuff,” Garvey told the Capital Journal.
The 11 hours per day of home care he receives is paid for by Medicaid, and the recent changes made to federally funded health care leave Garvey concerned.
“It’s important to me to have the stable support structure of Medicaid and Social Security,” Garvey said.

But Garvey insists his life “is a little bit stabler than a lot of people’s,” and speaking out about the importance of Medicaid, for him, is to help others.
“I know (Medicaid cuts) may not threaten me personally, and the cuts and stuff may not loom quite so tall over my personal life, but I’m just concerned about my community and the people that have worse situations than I do, and less of a support structure,” Garvey said.
The recently passed federal budget reconciliation bill made broad cuts of more than $1 trillion to the Medicaid program, largely in the implementation of work requirements and hospital tax changes.
Much of the changes targeted states who use their own funds to provide Medicaid to immigrants without “qualified” status. Estimates show nearly 12 million people across the country will lose their health insurance by 2034, as the Medicaid cuts are phased in.
What could be seen as a silver lining is the survival of Ohio’s Medicaid expansion group, which was in fear of elimination based on a provision of the state operating budget signed by Gov. Mike DeWine last week.
The provision of the state budget stated that if the federal contribution to the expansion group dropped by even 1% from the 90% contribution currently given to the state, Ohio would eliminate the expansion group, in a transition that could have resulted in more than 770,000 Ohioans losing their health insurance.
Nevertheless, health care advocates in Ohio say the federal cuts, as they stand now, will impact more than 400,000 Ohioans.
Willoughby resident Roman Sardo-Longo is a part of that expansion group that could have been on the chopping block. The 21-year-old is a first-generation American who credits Medicaid for opening up his life through mental health supports and gender-affirming care.
  Roman Sardo-Longo stands in front of the U.S. Capitol, after traveling to talk with representatives about Medicaid and the budget bill as part of a Planned Parenthood speakers bureau. (Photo courtesy of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.)
Sardo-Longo said he always had issues with anxiety and struggled to keep up with his education because he couldn’t bring himself to leave his house.
The fear of being misgendered as a transgender man, and delays in receiving gender-affirming care meant “everything was harder” for him.
“When I took my first (hormone replacement therapy) shot, I started to feel like my life was moving forward,” according to Sardo-Longo.
Medicaid is the only reason he could access the medical care that he needed to move forward and get his GED, think about going to school for engineering, and possibly get top surgery, he said.
He also joined Planned Parenthood’s “speaker’s bureau” as a way to tell the story of his health journey, and travelled to Washington D.C. to talk to congressional representatives about the budget changes.
“Very early on, things were really, really difficult for me, and so I don’t think I could have gotten through that part of my life without the therapy and the consults that I had,” he said. “You can’t work if you’re not healthy, you can’t work if you’re not happy or healthy enough.”
The necessity of Medicaid certainly isn’t lost on fellow Ohioan Mary Jane Sanese.
She spent a decade going through medical testing and appointments, and was eventually diagnosed at 23 with endometriosis, a chronic illness that affects the uterus, and can cause everything from inflammation to infertility.
The search for solutions was dependent on reliable health care and coverage.
“Even after (diagnosis), managing symptoms requires ongoing care with specialists,” Sanese said. “For me, that’s meant surgery, gastroenterology care, pelvic floor therapy, bladder treatments and routine preventive care to stay functional.”
But as she approached age 26, the age when she could no longer be covered by her mother’s health insurance, she couldn’t afford private insurance while working an hourly job and going to school full time.
She considered qualifying for Medicaid “a huge relief.”
A life without medical care or even just delayed care would mean “years of worsening pain, complications and irreversible damage” for her.
“The life of not having to worry about how I was going to afford treatment such as medication and appointments relieved me of so much stress, which I truly believe benefited my physical health,” Sanese said.
When the COVID-19 pandemic rolled in, she lost her job and faced much uncertainty, except when it came to her health care.
As a communications associate for Groundwork Ohio, she now has insurance provided by her employer, but the fact that she had the safety net of Medicaid when she needed it “quite literally saved my life.”
As part of her work, she helped advocate against the changes to Medicaid, in part by sharing her Medicaid story.
“No one should have to choose between going to the doctor or paying their rent for the month,” she wrote on Groundwork’s website as part of a call-to-action urging Ohioans to fight against the changes.

Democratic U.S. Senators Edward Markey, Jeffrey Merkley, Ron Wyden, and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on June 12 outlining hundreds of hospitals that were considered at-risk under Trump’s spending bill.

“Enacting these drastic health care cuts that will kick millions of people off their health insurance coverage, rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter. “In turn, rural hospitals will face deeper financial strain that could lead to negative health outcomes for the communities they serve.”
The 11 Ohio hospitals listed as at-risk under Trump’s spending bill according to the senators letter:

Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth (Scioto County).
Wayne Hospital Company in Greenville (Darke County).
East Liverpool City Hospital in East Liverpool (Columbiana County).
Coshocton Regional Medical Center in Coshocton (Coshocton County).
Twin City Medical Center in Dennison (Tuscarawas County).
Harrison Community Hospital in Cadiz (Harrison County).
Bucyrus Community Hospital in Bucyrus (Crawford County).
Holzer Medical Center in Jackson (Jackson County).
Galion Community Hospital in Galion (Crawford, Morrow, and Richland counties).
Adams County Regional Medical Center in Seaman (Adams County).
Fayette County Memorial Hospital in Washington Court House (Fayette County).

The letter said hospitals were “at risk of financial distress and even closure, conversion, or service reductions because of the cuts.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to the hospital systems for comment, but most did not respond by deadline. Those that did respond either said they are not at risk of closing or declined to comment. 
“Avita Health System, which includes Bucyrus and Galion Hospitals, is not financially at risk of closing,” said Kim Winkle, vice president of operations for Avita Health System.
Adena Health System, which oversees Fayette County Memorial Hospital, declined to comment.
Wayne HealthCare, which oversees Wayne Hospital, said in a June 24 press release they are not at risk of closing or cutting services, but said the spending bill “could have devastating consequences, particularly for mothers, infants, and low-income families.” 
The Ohio Hospital Association has not been notified of any member hospitals closing because of Trump’s spending bill, said Ohio Hospital Association Spokesperson John Palmer. 
The Democratic senators used data from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina for their letter. According to the letter, 338 hospitals across the country were listed as at-risk.
The hospitals were determined to be at-risk because they meet one or both of two financial criteria — the hospital is in the top 10% Medicaid payer mix of rural hospitals in the country, or the hospital has experienced three consecutive years of negative total margins. 
“Rural hospitals are often the largest employers in rural communities, and when a rural hospital closes or scales back its services, communities are not only forced to grapple with losing access to health care, but also with job loss and the resulting financial insecurity,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter. 
Twin City Medical Center and Harrison Community Hospital were listed as having three years of negative margins. The other nine Ohio hospitals were listed as top Medicaid providers. 
The most recent rural hospital closure in Ohio was last year when the Community Memorial Hospital in Hicksville (Defiance County) closed due to financial issues.

President Donald Trump may have only the faintest idea of what’s in the massive budget bill he signed into law last Friday, but sadly, the contents and the destructive impacts they’ll have are no mystery to the nation’s already beleaguered charities.
Last week, North Carolina food banks sent out an urgent alert explaining that the bill’s massive cuts to SNAP food assistance will have devastating effects.
While the state’s food banks provide over 250 million meals each year, they noted, SNAP provides nine times as many. And there’s simply no way for charities to fill the gap left by the impending federal cuts.
Meanwhile, at a gathering of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, advocates told NC Newsline’s Greg Childress that the bill will eliminate funding for more than 166,000 units of Permanent Supportive Housing at a time when homelessness is already spiking to new and alarming levels.
The bottom line: Hunger and homelessness in North Carolina are about to get much worse. And we can all thank Trump and his Republican allies in Congress for making it happen.

Jeff Crossman has filed a class action lawsuit challenging Ohio’s plan to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. The state budget finds the money by taking ownership of unclaimed funds left in the state’s care for more than 10 years.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit contends that’s an “unconstitutional and unlawful misappropriation of private property.”
Ohio unclaimed funds account, made up of forgotten deposits, uncashed checks and abandoned bank accounts, is worth nearly $5 billion.
To this point, the state has held those funds in perpetuity until their rightful owner comes forward to claim them. That approach is the broadly agreed-upon best practice around the country.
The handful of states that eventually do take ownership of abandoned funds wait far longer than Ohio proposes or limit the transfer to small dollar amounts.
Ohio’s new budget, however, rolls $1 billion in unclaimed funds to a new account supporting Sports and Cultural Facilities.
The majority is already spoken for — the Cleveland Browns are set to receive $600 million of that total to help fund their proposed Brook Park stadium.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Ohioans whose unclaimed funds get swept into the new facilities fund have a ten-year grace period in which the state will still honor claims. But to Crossman, that doesn’t legitimize the state’s plan.
“The State of Ohio intends to steal over a billion dollars in private property from its citizens and pour it into the pockets of Jimmy Haslam, one of America’s richest men,” Crossman insisted in a press release.
“Everyday Ohioans are rightfully outraged by this blatant abuse of power,” he added. “The government can’t just take someone’s property and give it to someone else. This type of outrageous behavior ignited the American revolution 250 years ago.”
Crossman warned the governor and state lawmakers are forgetting what the British learned at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British won that battle, admittedly at great cost.
Crossman and former Attorney General Marc Dann showed up at the Ohio Statehouse the day lawmakers voted on the budget, to warn the lawsuit was coming if lawmakers didn’t change course. Dann explained that several Ohioans and constitutional scholars have contacted their firm since the budget passed.
“Their message has been loud and clear,” Dann said. “What the state is doing isn’t just wrong — it violates the very reason we have constitutions and laws.”
Dann argued that constitutional protections aren’t a suggestion, and the state budget is attempting to sidestep longstanding rights to property and due process.
“The legislature and governor,” he argued, “have no authority to convert Ohioan’s private property into a slush fund that can be used to subsidize a billionaire campaign contributor’s private football stadium.”
Democratic former Ohio lawmakers threaten lawsuit over Cleveland Browns stadium funding plan

The lawsuit alleges Ohio’s plan infringes on U.S. and state constitutional protections. The complaint cites the Fifth Amendment’s command that private property can’t “be taken for public use, without just compensation” as well as due process guarantees in the Fifth and 14th Amendments.
The complaint notes the Ohio Constitution holds private property “inviolate.” Absent a public emergency, the government must provide compensation prior to taking private property with oversight from a jury.
The procedure contemplated by the state budget doesn’t even provide notice to people losing property, Crossman and Dann complain.
“The right to pre-payment of just compensation, as established by a jury, and the right to notice and hearing prior to taking of private property are fundamental constitutional rights afforded to all, and the government may not abrogate those rights in the name of expediency or convenience,” the complaint states.
Gov. Mike DeWine could have vetoed the funding mechanism when the budget landed on his desk. Instead, he allowed it to stay in, arguing the approach met his expectations by not relying on general fund revenue, and establishing a funding stream to benefit facilities beyond one NFL team.
Still, DeWine attempted to distance himself from the idea.
“Look, it wasn’t my choice of where to take the money,” DeWine said at a press conference about the budget. “But I achieved the two objectives that I thought were the most important.”
Crossman and Dann’s lawsuit has been filed in Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.

In November of 2023, 57% of Ohioans voted yes on Issue 2: the legalization of recreational cannabis. But since then, many GOP legislators have been trying to change the law — angering citizens, dispensaries, Democrats, and even fellow Republicans.
“Thumbing our nose in the face of the voters, I think that should be a non-starter for a lot of people,” state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, said.
State Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, has been the resident marijuana expert in the House, but recently, Fischer has joined him as the other leading voice in preventing the Senate’s proposed changes to Issue 2.
“We’re kind of the long and the short of the issue,” Callender said, jokingly pointing out the height difference between him and Fischer.

For the past several months, the Ohio House and Senate chambers have been trying to compromise on their separate bills.
In short, the Senate’s proposal decreases THC content, reduces home growing from 12 plants to 6, imposes more criminal penalties, and takes away tax money from local municipalities that have dispensaries. The House’s latest version had none of those.
Click here for Senate version and here for House version changes.
In June, Callender said an agreement was reached on following most of the House’s new version, which mainly focused on preventing children from accessing the drug.
But as we reported, the Senate pulled out of a deal at the last minute.
Once the senators said “no deal,” the chambers were left to figure out what to do to still pass legislation by the end of June.
But it never got there. The House GOP, made up of 65 members, couldn’t reach 50 “yes” votes.
“Those who are leaning ‘no’ have varied reasons why they’re leaning no — from, ‘I don’t want to vote for any bill that has the word cannabis in it’ to ‘it restricts too much and is against the will of the voters’ or ‘it’s going to harm local businesses and the hemp sales,'” Callender said.
Fischer, the state’s youngest lawmaker, who just turned 29, has been able to navigate the hemp side of the argument while Callender dealt with cannabis.
The Senate has also passed legislation that would completely remove hemp, low-level THC products such as delta 8, from being sold anywhere besides a licensed marijuana dispensary. This would prevent the grocery stores, smoke shops, wellness facilities, convenience stores, and gas stations from selling the product.
Fischer argues that this is against the free market, and there are better ways to regulate the product without harming businesses or consumers who don’t want to visit a dispensary or don’t have one in their area.
Delta 8 has become a major concern for Gov. Mike DeWine, who conducted an “undercover sting operation,” sending in teenagers to buy low-level marijuana from a convenience store.
As of right now, hemp products do not have an age requirement. Both Callender and Fischer say there should be, and also should have testing requirements like cannabis, which has all been included in their legislation.
“I don’t want to pass a policy that only punishes the people in Ohio that are playing by the rules, that are embracing regulation, that want to be productive and be a part of this conversation,” the Gen-Z legislator said.

The governor, on the other hand, says he just wants something done — and has been asking legislators to move on this for years.
“I’m hopeful that the legislature will wrap this up and give us a bill and we can go on to other, other discussions,” the governor said. “This is the whole issue in regard to the implementation of what the people of the state of Ohio voted on. It’s important.”
Marijuana policy expert state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, hadn’t been focusing on hemp while going through the negotiations process because he was under the impression that everything was fine with the Senate’s proposal, he said.
“We really haven’t had much discussion on hemp in the last six months or six weeks,” he said, adding that this is the number one priority to handle. “We felt it wasn’t the issue (we disagreed on).”
The Senate, even the last General Assembly when current House Speaker Matt Huffman was the Senate President, was in lockstep with DeWine on restricting marijuana access and handling hemp. The more marijuana-friendly House members, led by Callender, have been behind the stall.
“I believe that it’s really important that we get this done by June 30th, and particularly hemp, so our young Teenagers aren’t going to convenience stores this summer and getting intoxicated,” S. Huffman said in late June.
Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, stated that the lack of action prevents municipalities from receiving their share of the revenue. During the budget negotiations, lawmakers addressed a “defect” in the initiated statute, one that inadvertently prevents any of the tax revenue from being returned to its designated fund.
The law gives the 10% tax revenue from each marijuana sale to four different venues: 36% to the social equity fund to help people disproportionately impacted by marijuana-related laws; 36% to host cities — ones that have dispensaries; 25% to the state’s mental health and addiction services department; and 3% to the state’s cannabis control department.
Although the lawmakers could have expedited the distribution process by amending the law in the budget, they didn’t.
“There will not be distributions out to the local governments, to the host communities, until we deal with the entire marijuana bill,” Cirino said.
Cities would rather wait a few months to get their funding, Callender said, rather than have the Senate remove it completely — which was in that chamber’s proposal.
Asked if he was OK with the latest delay, Callender said he’s fine with it but thinks they need to do some implementation language.
“But generally, I’m fine taking another six months. I’d rather take six months and get it right than have something that is against the will of the voters,” he said.
“The will of the voters is a perfectly acceptable situation,” Fischer added.
Lawmakers will attempt to renegotiate in the fall.

(Getty Images)You’d be forgiven if among all the scary national and international headlines of the past few weeks you missed the first meeting of the newly formed Religious Liberty Commission.
You may not have even heard of this Trump-appointed commission of almost entirely Christian Nationalists tasked with “safeguard(ing) and promot(ing) America’s founding principle of religious freedom.” If religious freedom is something you value, you need to add this to your list of things to follow, because the first meeting made it clear that we are headed towards the end of religious freedom for all in our country. As an atheist, that really scares me.
President Donald Trump announced the commission during the National Day of Prayer event May 1. It is responsible for creating a report with recommendations for the president, due on July 4, 2026 (the 250th anniversary of our independence, just in case their intent to push the falsehood that the USA was founded as a Christian nation isn’t clear enough). The commission is just one of Trump’s many actions to appease his evangelical base, including his establishment of a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias” in February.
Religious extremists have been messaging around “Christian discrimination” for decades. They have fabricated a narrative where they are victimized by anyone who believes, lives, loves, or looks different than they do. This effectively scares the public into putting its trust into officials who say they will protect them against “the other.” Evidence of these anti-Christian offenses that the commission is meant to investigate is twisted to privilege extremist religious beliefs over the safety and wellbeing of others.
As an example of so-called anti-Christian offenses, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the arrest of 23 anti-abortion activists who were charged in 2020 with conspiring to storm an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. Kansans are intimately familiar with the violence directed toward abortion clinics and providers after the assassination of physician George Tiller in 2009, and we don’t need to look beyond last month’s assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband to see how religious extremists target Planned Parenthood and their supporters. Instead of understanding this, Trump pardoned all 23 activists this January.
The commission is made up of almost entirely of known right-wing Christians — including Texas Lt. Gov. and Chair Dan Patrick; former HUD secretary and vice chair Ben Carson; son of Billy Graham, disgraced evangelist Franklin Graham; former Miss California Carrie Prejean Boller; lawyers from Project 2025-affiliated organizations such as First Liberty Institute and Ethics & Public Policy Center; and right-wing TV and radio hosts such as Dr. Phil. A bishop, cardinal, and rabbi round out the members in what they tout as a “diverse” representation of faiths in America.
The commission will hold several more hearings over the next year to investigate the tired list of Christian Nationalist priorities, including so-called parent rights and “school choice,” prayer in schools, vaccine mandates, government displays of religious iconography, and “anti-Christian offenses.” As expected, the other key priority voiced throughout the day was to attack the LGBTQ+ community — especially trans kids.
During this first hearing, the real objectives of the commission became abundantly clear:

Rewrite history to make America a Christian nation. A key tenet of the Christian Nationalist political ideology is that America was founded as a Christian nation, and must return to this status to secure our future success. The commission repeatedly embraced this very narrow interpretation of key historical documents, including writings by the founders and the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the First Amendment. Both commissioners and witnesses denied the principle of church-state separation and a secular government.
Remake the courts with “courageous” Christian Nationalists. The courts, specifically the U.S. Supreme Court, will be the subject of many recommendations in the final commission report. The commission discussed which cases should be overturned, how Trump’s administration can assist with that, and how to make sure pesky state and local courts don’t get in the way. The Supreme Court has been chipping away at church-state separation for the past decade with crucial victories this term, but for this commission, this isn’t happening fast enough.
Promote religion in all parts of American culture, politics, and public life (but only if it’s their version of “Christianity”). Expert witnesses referred to a divine truth — the existence of a Judeo-Christian God — as the foundation for a moral, happy, and politically good society. Many devout Americans hold similar beliefs about their faith, but also recognize that our government should not prioritize one religion in a pluralistic society. Not only does this push minority faiths and nonbelievers such as myself outside of the bounds of this “virtuous citizenry,” but it asserts that one religion (Christianity) must be imposed on every person to create and maintain this good society.

In a world where we are facing very real threats to our physical, mental, and financial health, why did I spend five excruciating hours listening to a commission whose only job is to make recommendations? The obvious answer is because these individuals were hand-selected for holding a world view that advances the Christian Nationalist agenda and threatens any religious beliefs that fall outside of this ideology. The uncomfortable truth is that this rhetoric justifies hate crimes and the dissolution of rights for women and minorities has a new platform with the divine weight of presidential approval. As a lifelong atheist, I’m scared that we’re looking at the end of church-state separation and the rise of a theocracy weaponizing religion against people who don’t fall in line.
American Atheists just announced that it will no longer be hosting the 2026 World Humanist Congress in Washington, D.C., because the “Trump Administration’s actions … have created an environment that is not only incompatible with our values but also inhospitable to members of our global secular community.” They feared for the safety of their attendees because we are no longer a country welcoming of visitors, and especially not visitors who fall outside of a specific Christian identity.
But it’s not just the secular community who should be worried right now. Every person who has found within their faith the mission to love their neighbor, feed the hungry, protect the vulnerable, and embrace the stranger should be fighting for the sanctity of their beliefs. The members of the Religious Liberty Commission will not be including these priorities in their final report, and you will not find a place for your faith in their new America.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Some violence is kinetic — sudden and easily seen. Some is systemic — slow, sanctioned, and easily ignored.

Violence doesn’t always come with screams or sirens. Sometimes it slinks through legislation.
Ohio’s biennial budget is a slow, grinding assault on public education. This is a violence that unfolds over years and generations. It bleeds opportunity and shatters potential. It’s not breaking news, but it breaks futures all the same.
This is slow violence. Coined by scholar Rob Nixon, slow violence describes harm that accumulates quietly, invisibly, across years and lives. It doesn’t explode in a single moment; it seeps. Into school funding formulas. Into policy. Into the very scaffolding of what’s possible. 
Budgets may not detonate, but they can destroy lives. What we fund is what we value. What we refuse to fund is often where the quiet brutality begins. Because budgets aren’t just bureaucratic documents. They’re moral ones.
The bipartisan Ohio Fair School Funding Plan (FSFP) calculates the actual cost of educating a child and funds public schools accordingly. It accounts for factors like student-teacher ratios, minimum staffing levels, local demographics and special education needs. 
It’s not perfect, but it ensures that education, opportunity, and well-being aren’t dictated by skin color, home zip code or socioeconomic status.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s proposed budget kept the FSFP in name but gutted it in function, using outdated cost data that would’ve underfunded schools below even 1997 levels. The Ohio House scrapped it altogether, replacing it with an opaque formula stripped of equity. Ohio Senate leaders insisted they’d fully funded it. They hadn’t.
Before signing a final version of the budget forged behind closed doors by the House-Senate Conference Committee and passed by both chambers on June 25, DeWine made dozens of line-item vetoes. While the governor’s veto pen blunted some of the budget’s abuse, the shape and trajectory of its weaponization remain unbroken. 
Like Ohio Senate President Rob McColley and state Sen. Jerry Cirino’s Senate scheme, the signed legislation anchors the Fair School Funding Plan to obsolete cost data, starving public schools of about $2.8 billion. 
Ohio Republicans were especially ruthless to districts with high levels of student poverty. The state will pay those districts 107% less than promised. Even low-poverty districts will only collect 34% of what they’re owed — a 65% shortfall.
The cruelty of Ohio’s new biennial budget isn’t just in what it withholds — it’s in how it blocks communities from filling the gap. 
First, the state guts its obligation. Then it turns around and rigs the rules: restricting when districts can ask voters for support, capping what they’re allowed to save, even empowering counties to spike local bonds and levies. DeWine vetoed those provisions—for now. But Republicans hold the three-fifths majority to override him. The knife has been sheathed, not discarded.
Meanwhile, Republican giveaway season to the wealthy and well-connected rolls on. The governor left intact $1.1 billion in tax breaks for Ohio’s top earners and $600 million in free money for the out-of-state billionaire Browns owners to pay for their new megaplex playground. The math is clear — and cruel.
Though DeWine vetoed a new school voucher program, the budget adds more than $400 million in public money for private school tuition. All told, taxpayers will underwrite more than $2.4 billion for a privileged 10%, mostly upper-middle-class families already nestled in sectarian enclaves. 
These are structural acts of violence — deliberate disinvestment from the conditions that make learning, thriving, and democracy possible.
We know what happens when schools are starved: class sizes balloon, teachers flee, buildings crumble. Graduation rates fall. Crime ticks up. Wages fall. Hope recedes. The research is clear: when we cut education, we sever the future.

Public education is not a budget line item; it’s the backbone of democracy. Disinvestment shifts costs into the future, where they accumulate as inequality, incarceration, ill health, and civic decline.
No sirens. No endless news cycles. Just lines of a ledger that quietly strangle the systems our kids depend on. The damage is cumulative and eventually catastrophic.
To end slow violence, we need a politics of flourishing.
Flourishing means every Ohio student has what they need to learn and grow, regardless of race, place, or means. It provides the qualified teachers, safe buildings, engaging curricula, and mental health support they deserve.
A politics of flourishing lifts whole communities. Higher wages, lower crime, better health, deeper civic life — these are the dividends of investing in public education. It’s a politics that rejects the lie that public education and children are negotiable line items.
DeWine’s signature committed Ohio to violence by increment — consolidating cruelty day by day, month over month, year after year. The state’s Republicans didn’t just pass a budget — they legislated a slow violence.
Yet history gives homework: grassroots groundswell and relentless advocacy precipitated the DeRolph rulings that found Ohio’s public school funding system unconstitutional and led to Fair School Funding in the first place. 
As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen writes, freedom is not the absence of restraint — it’s the presence of capability. The harmful Republican budget makes people less capable. Yet, we have the power to heal.
Slow violence thrives in silence. It feeds on apathy, distraction, and the space between outrage and action. 
The assignment is to practice democracy — showing up, organizing, speaking out, voting, resisting.
The real test of democracy isn’t belief. It’s practice.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.

Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

She told a legislative panel Tuesday that the state's unemployment insurance trust fund is at risk of falling below federal solvency guidelines and that the situation could get worse by an economic downturn or rise in the jobless rate. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s unemployment insurance trust fund faces potential solvency issues that could worsen in the wake of massive federal employee layoffs or a recession, lawmakers were told Tuesday.
Labor Secretary Portia Wu told members of the Joint Committee on Unemployment Oversight that the state’s insurance trust fund of $2 billion currently meets federal solvency requirements. But she said that picture could change dramatically with new analysis reflecting economic downturns and unemployment levels that more closely reflect rates during those times.
“Claims levels are at historic lows right now because of the incredibly low unemployment rate,” Wu told the panel. “But again, as I was saying, we don’t anticipate that will continue.”
Wu’s comments included concerns about the potential for a massive displacement of federal workers under President Donald Trump (R). Some early state projections anticipate as many as 29,000 workers could lose their jobs as Trump culls federal agencies and employees.
The briefing came just hours before the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a lower court injunction that had been blocking Trump administration plans to slash federal payrolls.
Tuesday’s briefing was the first in what is expected to be a series of committee meetings leading to the 2026 legislative session.
Sen. Ben Kramer and Del. Lorig Charkoudian, Montgomery County Democrats who co-chair the panel, have sponsored identical bills to modernize the fund. This was the third year such legislation has been proposed. The meetings during the interim are a prelude to a fourth effort next year that could result in updated benefits and potentially changes — even increases — in assessments on employers.
Supreme Court opens door to large-scale federal layoffs

“I think the whole purpose of our getting together and starting to meet now and have this conversation is so that we have a better handle on what’s happening,” Kramer said. “I mean, some of the slides are a little bit scary, and they’re getting my attention.”
Charkoudian worried that abrupt changes in the surcharges on employers that could hit at the same time as an economic downturn that displaces workers.
“So, we talk about how do we fix the roof when the sun’s shining?” Charkoudian asked.
Even if anticipated economic downturns do not occur, Wu said the growing number of workers who are becoming eligible for the maximum weekly benefit is stressing the system to the point where the fund could fall below federal guidelines sometime between 2026 and 2027.
Currently, employers in Maryland pay taxes into the account — $26 per employee with a taxable wage base of $8,500. The rate has remained unchanged since 1992. Unemployed workers can receive a maximum weekly benefit of $430, an amount that has not changed since 2010.
Over time, market changes, inflation and a rising minimum wage have increased wages to the point where workers whose jobs might have earned benefits on the low end of the fund’s scale are moving closer to the maximum benefit.
“What’s happening is everyone is moving towards the ceiling of benefits, but that same thing isn’t necessarily happening to revenue,” Wu said. “So that’s where you start seeing a gap and eventually solvency problems.”
Inflation has also outpaced benefits: A dollar of benefits in 2010 went 24% farther than in 2025, Wu said, while average rents have grown by 30% over roughly the same period.
Mike O’Halloran, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, said other factors also play a role, and an increase in what businesses pay into the fund would be yet another state-imposed burden.
“Certainly, as legislators, you all are very well aware that some of the costs that businesses have taken,” he said. “Since 2015 … paid sick and safe leave, paid family and medical leave insurance, which has yet to come on board. So, I think when you’re talking about purchasing power, it’s also important to include some of those dynamics that employers are facing since they’re the ones that are funding the trust fund.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Charkoudian said during the briefing that new rates of $35-$50 per employee might have to be considered. Analysis from Wu’s department — the agency took no public position on any changes — included scenarios that raised the wage base to $15,000 in addition to changes in surcharges.
“I think we all appreciate and value our business and businesses in the state and ensuring their viability,” Kramer said. “But we’re also weighing it against what we’re looking at that’s being forecast, the solvency of the fund.
“I think engaging in this scenario with this body, we’re beginning the conversation,” he said. “So when we do get into session, we have a better handle of where we might want to go and how we do want to address it, keeping in mind all the checks and balances that are important to all of us.”
The unemployment rate in Maryland stood at 3.2% in May. That is higher than the 1.9% in June 2023 but still below the state’s 30-year average of about 5%.
Wu said the unemployment rate is key.
One analysis by the department projects the fund will fall below federal solvency guidelines by 2027 if the state moves back to its average unemployment rate and no changes are made to benefits or taxes levied on employers that feed the fund, Wu said.
An economic downturn, massive number of displaced workers, or a Great Recession scenario would hasten the pace at which the system becomes insolvent.
“We’ve been fortunate that it’s [unemployment] been so low, but I don’t think we can realistically count on it staying below 4% the way it has been, and even if it were to increase to the historical averages, that can create pressure on a fund,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0391-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

“He is a unifier.

A standing-room-only crowd filled the council chambers with supporters, including current and former state and county legislators and business and community leaders. Former Seat Pleasant Mayor Eugene Grant gave rousing remarks in support of Barnes.

Barnes was a Democratic state delegate from 2015 to 2023 representing the the 25th District. As chair, he will lead a five-member board that administers subdivision regulations in the county, approves various site plans and advises the county council on any proposed changes to zoning, among the body’s various duties.
The board, with the Montgomery County Planning Board, form the bi-county Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which acquires, develops, maintains and administers a regional system of parks.

	Each member serves a four-year term. Barnes’ term will run until June 2029. He replaces former chair Peter Shapiro, who was appointed in April 2022. Shapiro’s last day was June 14, said County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III.
For now, the board has only four members, after the February resignation of William Doerner. Braveboy has yet to name a replacement for Doerner, who would serve until June 2026.
Barnes, who runs his own government relations firm, Barnes International, thanked the dozens of people in attendance with a goal to create an atmosphere for the county to “win, win, win.”
“This is a great day that we have now to forge new relationships and talk about things in which we want to transform this county to be,” said Barnes, who served as chair for the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. “Park and planning will not be just for parks and recs in the county, but a destination for the world.”

“I am honored to lead the Maryland Food Bank at this important moment,” Kimmel said in a written statement. “I’m excited to continue the work to feed our neighbors and build stronger communities alongside our incredible teams, our network of food distribution partners, and our many donors, volunteers, and supporters.”
The food bank’s board of directors said Monday that they had selected Kimmel as the next president and CEO of the nonprofit organization. She will be taking over for former President and CEO Carmen Del Guercio, who is stepping down after holding those titles since 2016.
The Maryland Food Bank serves as a meal assistance hub for a majority of the state, connecting with local food banks and pantries to expand outreach for families needing extra help putting food on the table.
Kimmel has been with the Maryland Food Bank since 2012, serving in a variety of roles from the chief strategy officer to vice president of marketing and communications. She leaves her current position as the food bank’s chief operating officer to fill her new roles.
“By working together, we can both feed people who need a meal today and address the barriers that create hunger and hold it in place,” Kimmel said in the written statement.
Davis takes over as chair of Maryland Saves
Maryland State Treasurer Dereck Davis, a member of the MarylandSaves executive committee, was tapped Monday to be chair of the Maryland Small Business Retirement Savings Board, which oversees the management and operation of MarylandSaves workplace saving program.
Davis succeeds Joshua Gotbaum, who served as chair for the past seven years and who will continue to serve as a member of the board.

In a statement from the board, Davis called MarylandSaves “a vital program that empowers Maryland workers to invest in their future financial security.”
“It’s a valued benefit that small and medium-sized business can offer their employees – at no cost to the employer,” his statement said. “I’m proud to support this important retirement savings solution for Maryland’s workforce.”
Gotbaum said MarylandSaves’ “program of emergency and retirement savings through payroll deductions is already helping thousands of Maryland businesses and tens of thousands of Marylanders. I look forward to Treasurer Davis’s leadership as MarylandSaves continues to innovate for Marylanders and other programs throughout our nation.”
MarylandSaves was created under the Maryland law that required most businesses in the state to offer their workers a  retirement savings program. Launched in 2022, the program now offers “thousands of Maryland employers an easy way to comply with the law,” said Executive Director Glenn Simmons.
“MarylandSaves is easy for employers to manage and offers an emergency savings feature that lets savers access their contributions to cover unexpected expenses,” Simmons said. “Employees are enrolled automatically, have full control over their accounts, can choose investment options, change their savings rate, or pause and reactivate their automatic savings later.”
Participation in the plan is voluntary, but business that join — or that offer their own retirement plan to their workers — are eligible for a waiver of the annual $300 filing fee with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aisha-Braveboy-and-Darryl-Barnes-7-8-2025-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Attorneys for President Donald Trump told a federal district judge Monday that a request to turn an immigrants’ lawsuit into a class-action suit is little more than attempted “end run around” the Supreme Court and should be rejected.
The original lawsuit was filed by the immigrant advocacy group CASA and several pregnant immigrant women in an attempt to block Trump’s executive order denying citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of the parents was already a citizen.
The “birthright citizenship” ban was swiftly challenged in courts around the country and several judges, including Judge Deborah Boardman in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, issued preliminary injjunctions that kept the order from taking effect nationwide.
The government challenged the ability of the district judges to issue nationwide orders, and last month the Supreme Court agreed with the government, overturning the nationwide injunctions and sending the cases back to the lower courts for trial. Even though the injunctions were no longer in place, the government said it would not attempt to enforce the birthright citizenship ban for at least 30 days.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Within hours of the high court’s ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court with additional immigrant plaintiffs, asking Boardman to turn the case into a nationwide class-action lawsuit on behalf of all immigrant children born in the U.S. after Feb. 19, the original effective date of Trump’s order, and their parents. Boardman last week gave Justice Department attorneys until July 7 to respond to the class-action motion.
“The relief Plaintiffs seek is functionally no different from their prior (and now forbidden) universal injunction,” Monday’s response from the government says.
Class action lawsuits are allowed for cases in which a class is so large that it would be impractical to account for all members, there are questions of law common to the people in the class, and the representative class members named in the suit will fairly protect the interests of the class.
Trump’s attorneys argue that these criteria aren’t met.
“Plaintiffs’ differing immigration statuses create issues of whether ‘there are questions of law or fact common to the class,’ and whether ‘the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,’” the filing reads. 
Attorneys also argued that the court cannot issue a preliminary injunction because the previous preliminary injunction is still on appeal. They argued that plaintiffs are not entitled to a nationwide preliminary injunction, and that the court should stay the injunction pending its appeal.
The earliest date the administration would apply the order is July 27.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/U.S.-District-Courthouse-Greenbelt-9-30-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

May 21, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)In a Nebraska legislative session better known for its sound and fury than for a lot of substantive accomplishments, at least one bill stands as an exception.
At the eleventh hour, the Legislature voted to create a School Financing Review Commission, a bill sponsored by Sen. Jana Hughes and supported by 48 of the 49 state senators – with one senator excused and not voting.
A commission may not seem like a big deal, but it can and should have wide-ranging impact.
For several decades, our governors have declared and our legislators have generally echoed the notion that property taxes in Nebraska are too high, out of balance with the state’s overall tax level. Gov. Jim Pillen has recently said — yet again — that lower property taxes are his biggest priority.
As a result, the Legislature has been poking around at the margins, trying to effect change without ever getting at the biggest underlying problem: In our state, property taxes are the primary funding mechanism for our schools.
School districts generally receive more than half of their funding from local property taxes, and about half of the taxes an individual Nebraskans pays are from taxes on property.
Maybe there’s another way. But efforts to rebalance our three-legged taxation stool among income, sales and property taxes are not getting very far unless we take a long look at school funding.
Is our system the most efficient and effective way to support our fundamental responsibility to educate all Nebraskans? Is it the fairest way – both to taxpayers and to our children?
The last commission to review school finance met in 1988-89, and their work resulted in a school finance formula that started out well but was raided and distorted periodically since. Not to mention that circumstances change over 35 years.
This new effort to study and understand these fundamental questions in the light of today’s realities should move us toward outcomes that will be better understood, farther reaching and more substantive than what legislators have dinked around with in recent years.
Please say thank you to senators for supporting this. Then keep an eye on how the commission develops and what it ultimately recommends. This study should not be allowed to wither on the vine or get buried in a political graveyard.
This may not be flashy legislation, but following it through to a successful and substantive end could be one of the best things our government has done for us lately.

Ned Lamont has vetoed a good, if not perfect, housing bill, where do we stand?
Obviously, it’s roll-up-the-sleeves time. He and legislative leaders will take the summer to reconstruct what the governor foolishly rejected.
But before we get to the many issues the legislature needs to address in a September special session, we need to remind the governor and the bill’s cynical opponents of what’s most at stake: the freedom, opportunity and dreams of generations of our neighbors.
The governor — along with those screaming meemies at CT169Strong and many Republican lawmakers who say they want to solve the housing crisis but really couldn’t care less — doesn’t seem to understand that.
Governor Lamont always talks about jobs. And to that extent, he’s right. We need people able to afford to live in Connecticut  to fill vacancies and produce income and state revenues.
But you wonder whether he misses the point: that even more important than a job is the ability of families to move to and live in communities that provide them with other vital necessities: high-quality education, healthcare and other building blocks of opportunity.
Hundreds of thousands of state residents spend so much on rent and mortgage payments – way more than 30% — that they have little left for nutritious meals, transportation and warm clothing.
Meanwhile, Baby Boomers have no housing options to downsize into, so they stay in homes they can no longer afford or care for, leaving too little supply on the market to meet the demand. Home prices soar as a result – 60% or so since 2019 – driving many young families into the rental market, where that additional demand has propelled rents up 30% or so in that same period. That drives those at the bottom of the rental income spectrum, unable to pay the burgeoning rents, into homelessness, which was up 13% last year.
Governor, want to solve low test scores, absenteeism, and sagging high school graduation rates, all of which contribute to poverty, poor nutrition, swelling welfare rolls and un- or underemployment?
Don’t confine low- and moderate-income people to the meager 29 municipalities with a reasonable share of affordable housing. Those cities and first-ring suburbs have larger class sizes, underpaid teachers and fewer honors/AP classes and enrichments like art and music. Get the other munis to create some housing, (strategies below) so families who choose to can move to towns with higher-resource schools and abundant services.
Which brings us to resuscitating the vetoed bill.
The governor started off fine last week, insisting the bill’s opponents were spreading misinformation and that the target numbers of affordable units it included for each town were just that: goals, not mandates. He was right.
But apparently scared the screaming meemies would continue to screech their lies from now ‘til next Election Day, he vetoed the bill anyway. He could have shown courage and leadership, teaching the exclusionary obstructionists a lesson in decency. Instead, he admitted he hadn’t paid enough attention to the bill during the five-month legislative session.
That’s malpractice. For the truth is, the housing crisis in this state didn’t just materialize – it’s been getting worse for decades – yet he has shown little leadership on the housing issue for the entire six and a half years of his term in office. Yes, he’s thrown money at the problem. But there’s so much more he hasn’t focused on.
So here, governor, as I retire from housing policy work after more than two decades, are a few things I’ve learned that you might consider as you work to rewrite this bill:
Needed: real zoning incentives, real help for towns. 
The incentives offered in the bill – giving towns that create higher density zones near transit and other key locations a higher priority for state infrastructure grants – are well-meant. And despite the crocodile tears shed by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns, they’re fair. Towns that allow the creation of homes the state sorely needs deserve money for roads, sewers and sidewalks. Towns that don’t don’t. 
But there’s a real question whether those incentives will actually incentivize. Here’s an idea: cash. Towns need operating revenue and the state can afford it, despite what’s coming down from Washington. Cash for what? Pay them a set amount for every multifamily unit they zone for. Pay for two more planners per town (many dislike regional or state planning help) so they can actually focus on their towns’ housing needs; more zoning enforcement officers who can seriously go after blight and code violations; and even stipends for zoning commissioners – to increase the pool willing to serve — who now heroically work late into the night for nothing but a possible thank you, and more likely abuse and criticism from town residents.
Erasing impediments. 
Towns stop housing by raising development costs in many ways. They charge too much for sewer hookups, stretch out approval periods interminably to increase lawyer fees, and on and on. The bill’s provision to end minimum parking requirements is a start and the CCM/COST whining about loss of local control is silly. 
Developers aren’t stupid. They’ll create enough parking without being required to, otherwise they won’t be able to rent their units. So what about penalizing towns that erect barriers to housing? Check with the best land-use lawyer in the state, Tim Hollister. He’ll give you plenty of ideas.
Getting real about towns. 
You, governor, opined that “the great majority” of towns want to create housing. Take it from me, they don’t – even though it’s in their interest to do so (more revenue from the grand list, downsized housing choices for their elderly residents ie. voters), homes for workers, customers and adult kids who want to come home after graduation.
Housing creation’s too risky for reelection-obsessed first selectmen wanting to get reelected. And even if towns do want to create more housing, most have no real experience creating it proactively. They need to learn how to attract and work with good developers, how to use new wastewater technology where there are no sewers, how to think instinctively about converting old strip malls, vacant offices, schools and other buildings into housing.
The bond money you’ve given them is great but, alone, it’s like clapping with one hand.
Helping calm resident fears. 
I learned years ago not to condemn residents for expressing “NIMBY” sentiments. The checks they sign to buy their homes are the largest most ever write and everything -– their kids’ education, their security, their retirement –- is tied up in their homes. So while they have nothing to fear -– research and mounds of experience show mixed-income and affordable homes don’t increase crime and school budgets nor lower neighboring property values -– they need to be heard, allowed to express their concerns and get their questions answered. ‘
So why not widely finance what my colleagues and I have started: community conversations, led by trained facilitators, to expand resident engagement and understanding. It works. We’ve been making progress with town residents and, I might add, towns’ economic development commissions, who have a particular interest in maintaining and attracting businesses, labor pool and jobs to town. Those conversations can also be sparked by videos we’ve made showing that good people live in affordable housing and the homes are beautiful. Towns are using them to deflate the myths.
Create a land-use planning program at UConn. 
Other states benefit from their programs, but Connecticut towns have a hard time finding competent planners because the pool is tiny. Getting kids interested in local government in high school and undergraduate school will inculcate them with a simple notion: that local and state policy can be shaped by them to meet vital needs like housing.
Try living just a week on the housing wage. 
You’re fortunate to have wealth and you’ve been good about not taking a salary as governor. But it might be eye-opening if you understood what you can, and can’t, manage on the state’s housing wage – about $35/hour, or what’s needed to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment in Connecticut, as calculated by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. About half the state’s workers don’t earn that much. Several years ago, New York City mayoral candidates lived in public housing for a few days. It was a stunt, but nevertheless instructive, even revelatory.
Food, but no kitchen, cooks or table
Here’s the bottom line. You can’t just throw money at housing. That’d be like saying we’ll provide meals by spending only on ingredients. You need cooking utensils and a stove (infrastructure), plates and glasses (tools), a cook (planners and developers) and a table (zoning) to serve it on.
So, please, put together a good bill that gets at the key issues, one that’ll pass and that, most important, keeps in mind our current and future neighbors who are suffering because they can’t find homes or are paying much too much for them. And then get out and support it. Loudly. And forcefully.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota can’t build the prison it needs at the price it wants without sacrificing quality and longevity.
That was the message delivered Tuesday to the Project Prison Reset task force by the state’s construction manager, the state engineer and the consultant hired earlier this year to evaluate the options for addressing prison overcrowding.
The message didn’t take.
Citing the political realities of a skeptical Legislature, the task force voted unanimously to recommend that lawmakers support a men’s prison at a price point of $650 million during a special session whose date has yet to be set. 
Prison task force rejects original Lincoln County site, tightens budget for new facility

That’s $50 million higher than the limit the group set last month. It’s also $75 million less than the experts said the group’s preferred project would cost hours before the vote.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who leads the task force, said the figure is a compromise that moves the state toward a replacement for the 144-year-old penitentiary in Sioux Falls. 
“There is no appetite, none, for going above $650 million,” Venhuizen said.
House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said securing a two-thirds majority in both chambers — required for spending bills — will mean convincing lawmakers that the job can be done without cost overruns and supplemental budget requests. 
“We’re going to need to know that we can actually do it for $650 million,” Hansen said. 
Sioux Falls selected
The group also endorsed two vacant plots of industrial land in northeastern Sioux Falls just off Interstate 229, near Gage Brothers, a precast concrete company. The choice of which was left to legislators.
The task force voted to shoot down options in Mitchell or Worthing early on during its final meeting Tuesday, which took place at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls. Other site options were ruled out during earlier meetings, and some communities, including Box Elder, removed themselves from consideration after submitting proposals. 
Unlike the residents of Mitchell and Worthing, Joe Bunker of Gage Brothers told the group his company had no qualms with having a prison as a neighbor.
“I just want you to know that we’re not opposed to it,” Bunkers said.
The buildings on the recommended prison campus should be designed to last 100 years, the task force decided, with 1,200 beds for higher security inmates and another 300 for lower-security inmates. 
That configuration was one of 14 options presented Tuesday morning from Arrington Watkins, the consulting firm hired to assess the prison system’s space needs. 
The price estimate for the northeastern Sioux Falls prison complex is $725 million. That’s $100 million less than a 1,500-bed men’s prison proposed for Lincoln County, whose failure to earn the support of the Legislature back in February spurred the creation of the task force.


 The two sites in northeast Sioux Falls selected as potential prison locations.
Multiple sites shot down
Mike Quinn of Arrington Watkins ran the task force through the options Tuesday morning. None came in below $600 million, the price cap the task force adopted previously.
In addition to brushing off Mitchell and Worthing as site options, the group’s final recommendations eliminated options that would have placed buildings in multiple locations. Those included a small prison just north of the penitentiary across a Big Sioux River diversion channel and an additional dormitory-style building in Springfield, current site of Mike Durfee State Prison.
Those options were an outgrowth of questions from task force members about the need for a single high-security facility.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, a task force member, asked Quinn if any of the multi-building setups would be “the best option for the taxpayer.” 
The answer was no. Each prison site, regardless of size, Quinn said, would need to have recreation areas, kitchens and mess halls and other support areas.
“When you build three facilities, you’re building those buildings three times,” Quinn said, adding “it’s never more economical to split it up into smaller units.” 
Lieutenant governor suggests cheaper facility in Nebraska is ‘sub-par’
Hansen was one of several task force members to ask about a 1,512-bed Nebraska prison priced at $313 million for inmates at a variety of security levels.
South Dakota State Engineer Stacy Watters said the state of Nebraska has refused to release specifications for that facility, and denied a records request from South Dakota for more details, citing nondisclosure agreements with its contractors. 
What the state did learn, Watters said, was that the $313 million price only includes construction, not site preparation or design, and that it doesn’t include the intake area or medical facilities that South Dakota’s proposal does. Nebraska has already spent $130 million on buildings with those services over the past seven years, she said, and plans to use cheaper piping for its plumbing in the new prison project.
The design and materials being used in Nebraska are unclear, but “we had to assume that at that price, there was a reduced level of construction,” said Vance McMillan of JE Dunn, the state’s construction manager at-risk. 
Hansen questioned why Nebraska would hold back on sharing its design features for a public project. Venhuizen suggested that Nebraska is building a “sub-par” facility, and “that’s not something they’re really looking to admit.”
Other sites create doubt
McMillan told the group it had done all the due diligence necessary to keep its estimates low, bidding out every piece of the project. A cheaper price would mean building a prison that would need replacing sooner.
Comparisons to Nebraska or other states weren’t “apples to apples,” he said.
Report: Tough-on-crime policies could push prison construction costs as high as $2.1 billion

But House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said lower reported price points in other states have created enough doubt to put a new South Dakota prison in political jeopardy at the prices offered Tuesday.
“I’m sitting here as majority leader trying to figure out how I can sell this to a two-thirds majority of the Legislature not knowing all the answers,” Odenbach said.
The state has $566 million set aside in an incarceration construction fund, a balance built by infusions of COVID-19 relief money and earning interest. About $50 million of that is earmarked for a women’s prison in Rapid City, which is currently under construction. 
The fund will grow by $23 million of interest in August, Corrections Department spokesman Michael Winder said Tuesday.
That the state has the money set aside makes the project more palatable, but Rep. Greg Jamison, R-Sioux Falls, said worries about ongoing operational costs and concerns that the state might not be getting the best deal have left some lawmakers unwilling to trust the experts.
“Other states are doing it for less. There’s a shadow of doubt, and we need to rebuild that trust,” Jamison said, to get legislative approval. 
Jamison suggested that the group vote for 1,500 beds, cap the price at $600 million, and  recommend looking for a new construction manager at-risk, as JE Dunn and Henry Carlson’s single proposal was the only one the state fielded back in 2023.
McMillan, as well as some task force members, bristled at the idea of dispensing with JE Dunn and starting from scratch. McMillan told the task force that every month wasted carries the potential for greater costs.
He urged them to make a decision, and insisted that the team that’s worked on prisons for the state for the past two years could meet whatever design specifications that lawmakers want.
“We would be happy to build you a steel structure that would last you 50 years. That’s a decision that you guys have to make,” McMillan said.
McMillan said it would be “a tall order” to build a 100-year facility for $650 million. 
Decision: 100-year prison for $650 million
Judge Jane Wipf Pfeifle, a task force member, said switching gears on a construction manager would ultimately cost taxpayers. She also questioned the wisdom of setting an “arbitrary” cap on costs that could hamstring a new prison’s ability to meet the state’s needs.
Two consultants’ reports since 2022 have pointed to inmate population growth that will outpace the state’s ability to house prisoners without major policy shifts or new construction. The experts, she said, have shown their work to explain their prices and how their designs can address the problem.
Prison task force is offered sites east of Box Elder, near unbuilt hog operation in Sioux Falls

“They’re not saying ‘Gosh, I read in the newspaper that it’s cheaper in Arkansas or Nebraska,’” Wipf Pfeifle said.
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, was among the task force members to worry aloud about what the state would lose — including space for things like rehabilitation programming — by placing a cap of $650 million on the project.
Smith said he had little choice but to support the lower-cost compromise figure, but that “there are going to be corners that will have to be cut in order to get to that number, based on everything that you’ve seen today.”
Sen. Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, expressed similar concerns. Based on a question from Mehlhaff, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko told the group that after closing up the penitentiary, she could likely fill 1,500 beds with the state’s current prison population.
“We might build a facility that is overcrowded the day we move in,” Mehlhaff said, adding that spending $600 million of saved-up money without solving the problem would be “a poor stewardship of taxpayer money.”
Even so, Mehlhaff said, he recognizes that his fellow lawmakers need to be willing to move forward. Mehlhaff moved that the task force recommend the Legislature to direct the Department of Corrections to “come up with a plan” to build 1,500 beds “in the most efficient way possible,” with 300 beds for lower-security inmates.
Attorney General and task force member Marty Jackley suggested a $650 million price cap as an amendment. 
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

That addition was “not necessarily friendly,” the Mehlhaff said, “but if we could move the ball forward, I could accept that.”
Before the final vote, both Venhuizen and Hansen, a 2026 gubernatorial candidate, lauded the result as a win. Venhuizen said the task force had produced a workable compromise. Hansen said the group was able to find a location that, unlike the original Lincoln County proposal, is palatable to neighbors.
When asked if the lower price might force the Legislature to build a facility meant to last less than 100 years, Venhuizen said “I would rather build it smaller” than cheaper.
Compromises will need to be made, he said, but those decisions will need to come from the Legislature.
Hansen said he also wants to see a durable facility. He couldn’t speculate on what kinds of compromises might be necessary, but said there’s no question that a higher price tag is off the table.
“We’ll have to see what these guys bring to the Legislature,” Hansen said of the design team.

Bernat Bacete/Getty Images)After a Fox News interview raised the possibility of Alaska building a “Bear Alcatraz” Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy said on Tuesday that the state has no such plans. 
The Dunleavy administration statement was prompted by an inaccurate story by Newsweek that summarized the interview, asserting that the state had suggested the idea.
“The story is false,” said Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s director of communications by email. He said that he had demanded a correction from the Newsweek reporter. 
The Newsweek story referred to a July 1 interview on Fox News by host Laura Ingraham of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for pPolicy and homeland security adviser. Miller is known as the architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and a vocal proponent of ramping up ICE arrests, detention and mass deportations.   
In the interview, Ingraham and Miller praised Florida for building a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” for its isolation and being surrounded by wildlife in the Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Ochopee, Florida. It was constructed in just eight days, and can hold up to 3,000 detainees before deportation, and opened last week. 
Miller said he had pitched all Republican governors to build similar ICE detention facilities. “We want every governor of a red state, and if you’re watching tonight, pick up the phone call, DHS, work with us to build facilities in your state,” Miller said.
Ingraham said Fox reached out to states, including Alaska, for comment. “Alaska told us that ‘we don’t have alligators, but we have lots of bears.’ However, they aren’t aware of any plans for an Alaska version,” she said. 
“Of, I said, ‘Bear Alcatraz,’” Ingraham added, chuckling.  
When asked to comment on Alaska’s response to Fox News, Turner repeated there were no state plans to build such a facility. 
“I am not aware of any response from the state to Mr. Miller for a facility like the one in Florida,” Turner said. “The governor’s office was asked by Fox News if there were any such plans and the answer was no.”
Last week, President Donald Trump signed his signature domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which allocates a historic increase of $165 billion to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which administers ICE, through 2029. ICE’s budget is currently $10 billion.
The Department of Homeland Security said $165 billion includes $45 billion for new ICE detention facilities, $46 billion for border wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border, $14 billion for deportation operations, and billions for hiring 6,000 new Customs and Border Patrol agents, and 10,000 new ICE agents.

My challenge for RFK and the vaccine panel is this: Listen to the science, consult doctors with different views and opinions, and treat the population as if they were your own family. 
The post Americans deserve better than RFK Jr. and his panel of vaccine skeptics appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SINCE TAKING OFFICE as health and human services secretary under President Trump, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has launched an agenda aimed at dismantling the public health system as we know it.
Kennedy has let misinformation about vaccines run rampant and reversed Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women, while lifting conspiracy theorists into positions of power over vaccine policy. Those moves have sparked outrage in the scientific community and prompted national health groups to sue Kennedy this week over his assault on science and health. 
Kennedy has made massive cuts to the National Institutes of Health and vital research institutions, and Trump’s “big beautiful” tax and spending cut bill,  which Republicans passed and he signed last Friday, will result in massive cuts to Medicaid and wreak havoc on hospitals across the country.
One of Kennedy’s latest attacks has been on the CDC’s panel of vaccine experts by gutting the 17 original members and replacing them with eight vaccine skeptics. Even Republican senator Bill Cassidy called Kennedy’s new panel unqualified.
The panel of conspiracists recently discussed the long-standing practices for childhood immunization schedules. Already, we’re seeing global vaccine efforts stall, leaving millions, particularly children, at risk for preventable diseases. 
As a surgeon, I fear for the well-being of my patients. As a mom, I fear for the well-being of my children. As an American, I fear for our country. And as a global citizen, I fear for our world. 
Recently, RFK Jr. pulled funding from the global vaccine group, Gavi. As an organization, Gavi has paid for more than one billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. His reasoning for pulling the funding: ignoring the science. The hypocrisy is extraordinary. 
Part of me cannot blame Kennedy for his decisions, as they are based on sheer ignorance. Kennedy has neither a medical education nor medical training. 
Kennedy may not have studied the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 that killed 50-100 million people. A vaccine was developed years later, saving countless lives. He may not have studied smallpox either, which killed hundreds of millions of people until its eradication as a result of vaccinations in 1980. Kennedy may not truly know how live-saving vaccines are. 
He makes decisions based not on scientific facts but on misinformation, unproven studies, and health care influencers. How often do we hear the phrase, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet”? Still, vaccine deniers read from the internet rather than from research papers. It’s time for Kennedy to go away from TikTok and pick up a textbook. 
Even Kennedy himself has acknowledged the dangers of his rhetoric, publicly admitting that Americans shouldn’t follow his medical advice—an astonishing admission from the leader responsible for national health. Earlier in the year when asked hypothetically if he would vaccinate his kids for measles, Kennedy responded with “probably.” 
Kennedy’s campaigns actively jeopardize the health of his own supporters, especially those in predominantly conservative states. This misplaced skepticism has already sparked avoidable outbreaks, including measles, underscoring a hazardous hypocrisy at the core of current health and human services leadership. 
America deserves a Department of Health and Human Services focused on confronting real, urgent health challenges through collaborative, evidence-based solutions.
My challenge for RFK and the vaccine panel is this: Listen to the science, consult doctors with different views and opinions, and treat the population as if they were your own family. The vaccine skepticism and rhetoric coming from this administration have already caused parents to have to bury their children. 
Instead of firing and completely shutting out the 17 independent experts that once served on the vaccine panel, RFK Jr. should welcome them back for their takes on science. The evolution of science relies on different expert opinions and analyses. 
There are doctors all around the globe who want to advance science and keep our children safe. The main mission of MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is to protect our children. Doctors are eager to share their findings and practices with the the health and human services department, Kennedy, and his team of advisors.  
Before Kennedy and the vaccine panel go into work each day, I hope they think of what’s best for their children. Odds are, that’s what’s best for the millions of other children in the United States and across the globe. What can we do to improve the lives of our children? Changing regulated vaccine schedules for children is not the answer. 
As a physician and a mom, I use science to guide the decisions I make for my children. I hope Kennedy will start to do the same in setting policy for the entire country.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”










For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson



Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”

“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

The short route is currently served by diesel ferries like the Tokitae, seen here approaching Whidbey Island. (Photo by Tom Banse)Washington aspires for its largest-in-the-nation fleet of passenger ferries to operate reliably and emission-free by 2050.
To get there, the plan is to convert six existing vessels to hybrid-electric power, build 16 new plug-in boats, and add shore charging to 16 terminals — all by 2040.
But only one conversion is done. And neither new vessels nor electrified terminals are expected to be operational before the end of the decade. 
With projects taking longer and costing more than expected, achieving the ambitious mid-century goal for the ferry system looks increasingly unattainable.
“We can’t do everything we want to do. We can’t buy everything we want to buy, so let’s talk about the priorities,” said Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chair of the state House Transportation Committee, ahead of a work session Tuesday on where things stand in the ferry agency’s pursuit of electrification.
Rep. Andrew Barkis, R-Olympia, the lead Republican on the committee, agreed after the meeting.
“We need to sit down and review this whole thing — how we’re doing this, why we’re doing this — for the next 20 years for Washington State Ferries,” he said.
Conversion of the Wenatchee, a Jumbo Mark II-class vessel with a 202-car capacity, is done and it returns to service Thursday, a year later than expected. Its $133 million cost is much more than originally budgeted. Planned conversions of two other boats are on hold indefinitely.
A week ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson announced he’d accepted Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group’s bid to build three new hybrid electric ferries. The first one — at a total cost of about $405 million — is expected to be delivered in about five years. 
The large price tags and long timelines are stirring conversations among lawmakers and with the governor on how they can erase Washington State Ferries’ carbon wake, given limited resources and high demand for service.
“The path from here to there is going to be a little more unpredictable and bumpy, but we’re going to get there,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “We’re headed in the right direction.”
Liias said he’s ready to focus on procuring new boats and using cleaner, renewable diesel to fuel existing ones, and pause converting existing boats to electric power for the time being.
A new boat will be in use for 60 years while a converted one gains an estimated 25 years of service, he said. Adding new vessels and switching the entire fleet to cleaner-burning diesel could get the state to 90% of its emission reduction goal by 2050, he postulated.
“We need to be more eyes wide open after what we’ve seen with the Wenatchee,” he said. ”We want to see cleaner air, but we can’t write a blank check.”
The cost-benefit of converting the jumbo ferry came up late in Tuesday’s work session
State ferry officials estimated $96 million of the $133 million total could be viewed as directly related to changing the vessel to a hybrid-electric. Though the amount would be less when factoring in savings from buying less diesel fuel when operating on battery power, they said.
Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Port Angeles, vice chair of the transportation committee, wanted to know what amount of greenhouse gas emission reduction would be achieved. State ferry officials didn’t have an immediate answer.
“From a cost perspective, is this an efficient or good use of the state’s money? To me, it seems pretty expensive,” he said. “I would hope that there would be quite significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to continue down this path.”
Executive orders issued by former Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee in 2018 and 2020 are steering Washington State Ferries’ transition to an emission-free fleet. There’s also a separate state law requiring state agencies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2040 and to be at net zero a decade later.
In 2020, the ferry agency published its System Electrification Plan. It carried an estimated cost of $4 billion, but that figure is “outdated,” David Sowers, who oversees the electrification program, told House members. “It doesn’t reflect the current bidding climate,” and other costs like tariffs, he said. So far, the agency has secured $1.68 billion.
After the meeting, Bernbaum said his questions regarding the conversion were to better understand “what we are actually paying for” in the push to carry out the electrification program.
If the goal is protecting the planet from the effects of climate change, and there is $80 million to spend, is it better spent on converting one ferry or on a utility-scale solar or wind farm?” he said.
“We should be aspiring to get to net zero. But we should be spending those dollars in a wise way and that means not being absolutist,” he said. “I think we’re in a nice reflection point when we’re starting to get the data back and it gives us an opportunity to reflect and think about if this is the best path forward.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WSF-washington-state-ferries-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 22:00:24.379150

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)North Providence Town Councilor Stefano Famiglietti swept the four-way Democratic primary for the open Senate District 4 seat Tuesday, with nearly 69% of votes as of 9:04 p.m.
Results are preliminary and unofficial, with mail ballots submitted Tuesday still being tabulated, Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said via text Tuesday night. Roughly 10.5% of the district’s 22,000 registered voters cast ballots in the special primary.
Famiglietti, 33, a lawyer, rang in his victory with friends, family and supporters at the Knights of Columbus hall on Douglas Avenue in North Providence. In a phone interview, he chalked up his strong showing to his community ties, including as a Town Council member since 2018.
“I know this community,” Famiglietti said. “I was born here. I went to school here. I worked here. I walked every night sharing my ideas with the community, and the community responded.”
The special primary was triggered by the death of the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died in April after a battle with cancer. Ruggerio held the seat for 40 years prior to his death.
Famigietti noted his close ties to Ruggerio, pledging to “follow in his shoes,” if elected. First, he must beat Republican Alexander Asermely in an Aug. 5 general election. 
Senate President Valarie Lawson, who succeeded Ruggerio in chamber leadership elections, congratulated Famiglietti in a statement Tuesday night.
“As a councilman with deep roots in the community, Stefano has a keen understanding of the needs of District 4, and he will carry forward the sincere commitment to service that Senate President Dominick Ruggerio exemplified,” Lawson said.
Former state Rep. Marcia Ranglin Vassell, who finished a distant second with 15% of the vote, said she did not plan to call Famiglietti to concede or congratulate him.
“I don’t have his number,” Ranglin-Vassell said in a phone interview Tuesday night. She also said she had not looked at the results, though she planned to.
Ranglin-Vassell, 65, a Providence Public Schools teacher, is also planning to file a formal complaint with the state elections board against Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and Famiglietti supporter, over Corvese’s actions at Veazie Street Elementary School polling place in Providence earlier in the day.
Ranglin-Vassell alleges Corvese violated state election rules by entering the polling place wearing stickers for Famiglietti. 
Corvese declined to comment. Famiglietti, who was not there at the time, said Ranglin-Vassell’s accusation was “nonsense,” and “disappointing.”
Also yet to concede Tuesday night was third-place finisher Lenny Cioie, who drew 11.6% of votes. Cioe’s tone was dejected as he reflected on the outcome of the primary race.
“The machine won, as usual,” Cioe said of the results. “It is what it is. I’ve run against the machine before.”
Cioe, 66, a registered nurse and progressive, unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries for the seat spanning North Providence and north Providence.
Famiglietti, whose campaign was led by Ruggerio’s family members, disputed Cioe’s claim. 
“That’s been a fallacy this whole campaign, all this talk about the establishment and the machine,” Famiglietti said. “They missed the fact that I’ve been in this community since I was born.”The fourth candidate, Manny Taveras, finished with just under 5% of votes. Taveras, a first-time candidate and brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, praised his campaign team and supporters.
“I really wanted to win this election, but I am very proud of how hard my team fought, said Taveras, 40, an account executive for a pharmacy benefits management company. “There are so many doors opening for so much more in the future.”
Among those doors could be a bid for the now-open seat on the North Providence Town Council. Taveras acknowledged he might run, but did not confirm. Details of the election for the open town council seat have not been set.
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026.

In a written order published Friday, the court reversed the conviction of Rigoberto Guillermo Walker and said that prosecutors may elect to retry him for attempted murder.
If the case is not retried, Walker will still be guilty of first-degree assault and may be sentenced for that crime.
Walker was the perpetrator of a shocking 2019 incident when he stabbed a 74-year-old woman at random outside an assisted living facility.
According to prosecutors, Walker approached the woman, who was using a walker while she was gardening, began cursing at her, then attacked her with a knife.
Walker, who was on probation for other assaults at the time, had numerous prior convictions, including four for arson, and was convicted at trial in 2022. 
Before jurors deliberated in that trial, the judge issued the jury instructions that said in part, “unless the contrary appears from the evidence, the jury may draw the inference that the accused intended all the consequences which one standing in like circumstances and possessing like knowledge should reasonably have expected to result from any act knowingly done or knowingly omitted by the accused.”
That was a mistake, because the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that judges should not use that particular jury instruction, known as the “Mann instruction.” It’s named after the federal case that struck it down, because it can prejudice a jury against the defendant by shifting the burden of proof regarding the accused person’s intent from the prosecution to the defense.
Walker’s attorney objected to the language, but prosecutors argued in favor, incorrectly saying that the Supreme Court and appeals court had approved it.
Writing in last week’s order, the appeals court said that the confusion is understandable, because in some cases it has found the use of that prejudicial jury instruction to be harmless.
In addition, the state changed some standard jury instructions a few years ago. 
While other uses of that old language were found to be harmless, it was not harmless in Walker’s case, the court ruled. 
“Here, Walker was convicted of a specific intent crime in a trial where the sole contested issue in relation to the attempted murder charge was whether Walker acted with the specific intent to kill,” wrote Judge Marjorie Allard on behalf of the court.
“Moreover, the potential prejudice caused by the Mann instruction was amplified by the fact that the prosecutor expressly referred to the instruction in closing argument and used the instruction to argue the State’s theory of specific intent. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the giving of the Mann instruction — an instruction condemned by the Alaska Supreme Court nearly five decades ago — was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”

In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups, and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

Democrats blocked it.,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/pa-house-republicans-tried-to-force-a-vote-on-a-transgender-athlete-ban-democrats-blocked-it/,"The bill had already passed the GOP-controlled Senate, with five Democrats joining every Republican in supporting it.","A view of the state Capitol dome in Harrisburg. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Members of the Republican minority in the state House tried to force a vote on a bill that would ban transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports in public schools and publicly funded colleges. 
But, Democrats on the House Education Committee blocked them.
The bill had already passed the GOP-controlled Senate, with five Democrats joining every Republican in supporting it. After crossing over to the Democratic-controlled House, the bill stalled in the Education Committee.
The maneuver House Republicans used to try to force a vote is called a discharge resolution, which allows 25 lawmakers to petition to have a bill forced out of committee after it’s sat for 15 session days. 
But Democrats on the panel re-referred the measure to the House Health Committee, effectively resetting the clock and avoiding a vote on the proposal itself.
The vote to re-refer it passed on party lines, 14-12. Nine Republicans spoke against the move to effectively block a vote on the bill, framing the underlying issue as a matter of “safety,” and portraying Democrats’ move as a way to stop debate.
“It’s time we stand with our female athletes in Pennsylvania,” said Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster), minority chair of the committee. “They not only deserve a fair shot on the field, I believe they’ve earned a fair vote and a full vote on the House floor.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Rep. Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh), chair of the Education Committee, said in a statement that he opposes the bill, and it belongs in the Health Committee instead of his own. 
“I will never support legislation that targets any at-risk community, including our LGBTQIA+ neighbors,” Schweyer said. “Simply stated, SB 9 would make school harder for kids already facing serious and severe bullying.”
Defending the decision to push the bill out of his panel, Schweyer added, “SB 9 would not add one teacher to the classroom, repair one broken school building air conditioner, buy one new textbook, or help one kid get into college or find a good paying job.”
The push to vote on the measure comes after the University of Pennsylvania agreed to ban transgender athletes from participating in gendered sports earlier this month, following pressure from the Trump administration. As it stands, 27 states have bans on transgender athletes participating in school sports. 
Until February, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association allowed transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports, but changed the rules to comply with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear cases over bans in West Virginia and Idaho last week

Corinne Goodwin, chair of the Eastern PA Trans Equity Project, said that transgender athletes, like all students, benefit from participation in school sports.
“When they participate in school sports, our youth learn important lessons including how to win with dignity, how to lose with grace, how to support their teammates, and how to play by the rules,” Goodwin wrote in a statement. 
She added moves to ban transgender athletes from school sports can have negative impacts on all students, and the anti-transgender rhetoric that can accompany these efforts has had damaging effects on the health of transgender Pennsylvanians.
“As an example of how this has had an impact, calls/contacts to our info and referral line have increased by over 100% this year as has attendance at the community support groups,” they added. “People – especially parents of transgender youth – are concerned not only about their mental health, but for their physical safety.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/state-capitol-dome-scaled-e1752020042584-1024x621.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 21:04:53.803348

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,'” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198372169-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 21:04:53.803348

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on July 7.
WINDSOR — A sign with a large pink background was stuck in the red mulch over the weekend under a green canopy in front of the entrance of Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax, boutiques of flowers spread around its base.
“MUST BE GOD NEEDED A CHEERLEADER IN HEAVEN,” the sign announced, saying just enough for people who understood its reference.
Students and teachers are in mourning over the loss of one of their own, 14-year-old Maameyaa Ntiriwaa. Everyone knew her as “Pinky,” in keeping with the electric pink color of her long, neatly woven braids.
Pinky, who had recently graduated 8th grade and was on her way to high school in the coming school year, died in a drowning incident at Kennedy Pond in Windsor on July 2. She had come to Windsor with family friends, police said last week.
“She was a bright light in any dark day,” said Danielle Rothy, whose family lives on the same street in Fairfax as Pinky’s and coached her on BFA Fairfax’s cross-country team.
“She had a vibrant personality, a big smile, and so much sass,” Rothy said, her voice choking during a phone interview with the Valley News on Monday.
The pink sign out in front of the school was put up by Pinky’s classmates, Rothy said, to honor their friend, who was an enthusiastic member of BFA Fairfax cheerleading squad.
In the neighborhood, Pinky was the leader among a band of 15 or so kids who all lived within doors of each other, Rothy said, noting that Pinky served as a role model for them, including for Rothy’s own two children, a 9-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son.
“She was on the older side of the kids in our neighborhood and she took care of all the younger ones. She was the leader and they all just followed her around like little puppies behind their mom,” Rothy said.
Pinky “would take care of everybody and was kind to everyone,” Rothy said. And a peacemaker.
“She was always trying to mediate issues between other people,” Rothy related.
Pinky’s family is from Ghana, according to Rothy, although all the children were born in the U.S. After Pinky’s death, Rothy, Fairfax’s parks and recreation director, said she was approached by Pinky’s fellow cheerleaders to ask if they could all wear pink — “her favorite color” — in honor of their belove squad member in the town’s annual July 4th parade.
“But instead of just having the cheerleaders do it, I opened it up to the entire town and invited people to wear pink” said Rothy, who took to social media in a call for parade-goers and the town to wear something pink to commemorate the Pinky.
The celebration in pink for Pinky continued over to the town party in the park, where one of the food vendors donated all the tips from his tip jar to Pinky’s family, Rothy reported in a social media post. “A lot of people wore pink. It was a very much a pink parade and it was hard, but we did it,” Rothy said.
Last week, a person who described themselves as a friend of Pinky’s family launched a GoFundMe campaign to raises money for her family and help pay for Pinky’s funeral service.
By Monday afternoon, the campaign had received 532 donations and raised more than $36,000.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.
 


Reed: ‘Further cuts would have been an abject disaster’
Rhode Island Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, called the Trump administration’s retreat on more mass layoffs at the VA “a reprieve for veterans and their families” in a statement Tuesday.
Reed is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon-VA), which oversees VA funding, issued the following statement:

“The Trump Administration’s initial arbitrary workforce cuts have already harmed veterans and their families,” Reed said. “Trump and DOGE were downsizing simply for downsizing’s sake – not because they carefully studied appropriate staffing levels. Their careless cuts diminished essential services and increased wait times. Further cuts would have been an abject disaster and halting them is significant. This about face is a direct result of strong advocacy from veterans, their families, and everyone who cares about keeping our promise to those who serve. Now we need to reverse the loss of 30,000 VA employees, restore staffing levels, and get the VA running at full capacity again so it can deliver for those who faithfully served.”
In March, Reed spoke out against the Trump Administration’s proposal to cut over 80,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Troopers reported seeing what they believed was a firearm in the man’s hands, and when he didn’t respond to commands, one of them opened fire. A later search found no firearms in the man’s apartment.

A state trooper shot and killed a man Monday in Putney after reportedly seeing what he believed was a firearm in the man’s hand and after the man ignored police commands, according to the Vermont State Police. 
A later search of the man’s apartment, police said Tuesday, turned up no firearms. 
Scott Garvey, 55, who lived in the apartment at Putney Landing where the shooting occurred, died from gunshot wounds to his torso and left lower extremity, according to a state police press release Tuesday evening. 
Trooper Peter Romeo, who fired on Garvey, has been placed on paid relief-from-duty status, which is standard state police protocol following a shooting. 
Romeo works out of the state police barracks in Westminster, where he has been assigned since his graduation from the Vermont Police Academy in January 2023, according to the press release.   
Events leading to the shooting began around 11:20 p.m. Sunday, when police received a call from a person at the apartment reporting a “mental health concern,” the release stated.

A mental health caseworker embedded with the state police “dealt with the concern over the phone, and troopers did not respond to the scene,” according to the release. 
At about 7:15 a.m. Monday, the release stated, police got another call coming from the apartment, followed at 11:15 a.m. by a report from another Putney Landing resident that Garvey was outside “exhibiting concerning behavior and making threatening” comments. 
Troopers went to the apartment along with the mental health caseworker. 
“Mr. Garvey returned to his apartment and barricaded himself inside while continuing to make threatening statements, including of self-harm,” the release stated. 
The caseworker and troopers tried to talk with Garvey to resolve the situation to no avail. The troopers then got a warrant to enter the apartment to charge him with criminal threatening and disorderly conduct, the release stated. 
“Upon entering the apartment at about 4:30 p.m., troopers encountered Mr. Garvey and reported that they saw an object in his hands that they believed to be a firearm,” according to the release. “Mr. Garvey did not respond to commands given by the troopers. Trooper Romeo fired his service weapon.”
State police did not say how many shots were fired. Garvey was pronounced dead at the scene. After the shooting, the release stated, a search of the apartment found no firearms inside. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office and Windham County State’s Attorney’s Office will be conducting independent reviews of Romeo’s use of force. 
The Windham & Windsor Housing Trust, owner and operator of the Putney Landing apartment complex, posted a statement Tuesday on Facebook.
“We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that took place yesterday at Putney Landing during an encounter between Vermont State Police and a resident experiencing a severe mental health crisis,” the post stated.
Despite “efforts to de-escalate and bring the situation to a peaceful resolution, the confrontation ended in the loss of a life — a heartbreaking outcome for everyone involved,” the posting added.
The post did not name the resident who died, but he was later identified Tuesday evening by state police as Garvey.
“Our shared responsibility is to care for one another and to build a stronger, more compassionate response to those in crisis — one that upholds the dignity and value of every person,” the post later noted.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 23:21:48+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. Josh Elliott files to challenge Lamont for governor,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/rep-josh-elliott-files-to-challenge-lamont-for-governor/,It wasn't clear if Josh Elliott was committed to an all-or-nothing run for governor or was testing Democrats' appetite for an alternative.,"State Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal who recently predicted that Gov. Ned Lamont would not go unchallenged for the Democratic nomination if he runs in 2026, filed papers Tuesday creating a gubernatorial campaign committee.
Unclear was whether Elliott was committed to an all-or-nothing run for governor or a campaign to test Democrats’ appetite for an alternative to Lamont, whose centrist politics on fiscal issues are a source of tension with some on the left.
Elliott, who has called for a more progressive tax structure, said by text he will make a formal campaign announcement Monday in Hamden.
Elliott, who declined further comment, ran for secretary of the state in 2022, staying in the campaign through the nominating convention, then opted to quit and seek reelection to the House. 
“I don’t think it’s an all-or-nothing,” said Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, a progressive ally of Elliott. But she also cautioned against a comparison to 2022, saying, “I think this is a really different moment.”
Hughes said the party needs a more aggressive approach to a Trump administration that she says is promoting “a police state” and dismantling the social safety net, and there is a desire for generational change.
“The governor doesn’t understand the urgency,” she said.
Elliott, 41, a five-term state lawmaker, is the first Democrat to file papers creating a gubernatorial campaign committee. Lamont, 71, said last month he was seriously considering a third term but stopped far short of an announcement.
Jen Tooker, the Westport first selectwoman, is a declared candidate for the Republican nomination. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, also a Republican, has an exploratory committee and is expected to run.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Elliott had informed him of his intention to open a campaign, but he declined to speculate on whether Elliott would try to force a primary if Lamont runs.
“Josh has become a very good friend and trusted colleague,” Ritter said. “And he indicated to me that he wanted to go out and talk to people.”

Lamont, who has consistently scored positive, if not exemplary, approval ratings since a rocky start in 2019, is widely seen as well-positioned in a general election, given fiscal  policies that have cut taxes, paid down debt and produced record budget reserves.
Those same fiscal policies have generated criticism from some labor leaders, most notably Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO. Lamont’s vetoes of a labor priority, a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, and an omnibus housing bill, also provoked complaints on the left.
One Democratic strategist who has been privy to discussions among the potential of a challenge to the governor said of Elliott’s filing: “I think this is a shot across the bow.”
The strategist declined to be quoted by name, citing the sensitivity of those discussions. If nothing else, the strategist said, Elliott could make Lamont more open to policy overtures from the left.
Rob Blanchard, the governor’s communications director, had no direct comment on Elliott’s candidacy but stressed the governor’s Democratic credentials.
“From day one, Gov. Lamont’s focus has been on expanding opportunity and making Connecticut more affordable for working families. He championed progressive priorities such as free child care for families making less than $100k, paid family and medical leave, expanding our earned income tax credit for our lowest-earning residents, and increasing our minimum wage to one of the highest in the country,” Blanchard said.
Blanchard indicated the governor would not rest on that record.
“While that’s a proud record on affordability and opportunity that could go up against anyone,” Blanchard said, “the governor understands that more must be done to bring costs down for families across Connecticut, and it will continue to be the No. 1 focus of his administration.”
Hughes said the upset victory by 33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayoral primary has exposed an appetite for new leadership, as did the recent announcement of a 37-year-old Hartford school board member, Ruth Fortune, that she would challenge U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District.
In an interview the day after Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a Democratic mayoral primary in New York City, Elliott was reluctant to find evidence of vulnerability by Lamont in Cuomo’s defeat, given Cuomo’s resignation over sexual harassment accusations.
“You need to be really aware of luck — and that’s not to in any way detract from that race — but I think that Mamdani got lucky to be against a truly unsympathetic competitor, where Ned is a nice guy and is really likable,” Elliott said.
Elliott did note, however, that he began his own career by announcing an intention to run a primary against Rep. J. Brendan Sharkey, D-Hamden, who then was the House speaker. Sharkey ultimately did not run in 2016.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/52977603-5EC8-4655-B7E3-AC939496E087_1_105_c.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)On the 20th anniversary of a legislative pay raise scandal that upended the General Assembly, government watchdogs said undemocratic practices persist at the state Capitol.
“How things get done determines what things get done,” said Tim Potts, president of the group Democracy Rising. “And if that process is corrupt, you’re probably not going to get a very good result.”
After a 2 a.m. vote on July 7, 2005, the legislature passed a bill without debate to increase salaries by 16% to 34% for government employees in legislative, executive, and judicial branches. After passing 157-40 in the House and 28-22 in the Senate, Gov. Ed Rendell signed it into law later that day.
But controversy broke out over the way the pay hike was enacted and served as a breaking point for government reform advocates. 
The legislature “went rogue,” according to Barry Kauffman, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. 
Pennsylvanians struck back after seeing, “cowardly legislators slink secretly into the night to pass exorbitant pay raises and benefits that violated the state constitution and demonstrated disrespect for their constituents,” he said.
The move spurred a grassroots effort to repeal the raise just four months after it went into effect, as well as a movement to vote out all incumbent lawmakers in the 2006 primary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Anti-corruption advocates like Potts and Eric Epstein, founder of the watchdog group Rock the Capital, drove the effort to repeal the bill. Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon County — then a businessman and entrepreneur — launched a PAC, PACleanSweep, dedicated to removing incumbents. 
Gene Stilp, a reformer and activist, challenged the legality of the pay raise in court, resulting in the state Supreme Court ruling in September 2005 that the bill’s unvouchered expenses were unconstitutional for all government employees, except state judges. Common Cause filed suit in federal court to repeal the bill, but the case was thrown out in 2006.  
Two decades later, those same advocates still have their eyes trained on state government, and they are doubtful enduring changes to legislative culture took root.
“Reform in Pennsylvania is like spraying perfume in a sewer,” Epstein said. “Twenty years later, we still have a government of corruption, lies and sewage.”
Before the bill could be repealed in November 2005, lawmakers received payments classified as “unvouchered expenses,” ranging from $1,300 to $14,500 before taxes. Twenty-seven senators and 103 representatives accepted the increased salary.
Lawmakers who took the 2005 pay raise who remain in office include Sen. David G. Argall, R-Carbon County, Sen. Anthony H. Williams, D-Philadelphia, Sen. Christine M. Tartaglione, D-Philadelphia, and Sen. Vincent J. Hughes, D-Philadelphia. 
At the time, rank-and-file legislators made just under $70,000, but currently earn more than $110,000 as a result of cost-of-living increases enacted 20 years ago. Today, only California and New York lawmakers earn more than Pennsylvania lawmakers.
According to Stilp, “there’s not a class of new legislators who have the backbone to do anything about reform in this building.” 
But he says he believes reform is possible when more people get involved. He mentioned his 2009 lawsuit against the State Ethics Commission as an example of a citizen-led effort to change a legislative process. 
According to Kauffman, the backlash to the salary scandal and the changes it achieved could provide a blueprint for future reform and an example of democracy in action at a time when political norms are being challenged daily on the national level.

A year before the pay raise passed, the legislature had employed a similar process to pass a bill legalizing slot machine gambling for the first time. 
The 2004 gaming bill also was approved in the early morning hours and immediately drew opposition from lawmakers and activists, who argued it violated constitutional provisions intended to make the legislative process transparent for the public. 
Specifically, critics condemned its sponsors for introducing it as a one-page bill on an unrelated issue, and then amending it into a 145-page proposal to legalize slot machines. After lawmakers and activists challenged the measure, the state Supreme Court eventually upheld its constitutionality in 2005.
In the wake of the controversy over gaming, the tactics used to pass the pay raise immediately sounded an alarm for government watchdogs.
“This was so incredibly brazen,” Kauffman said, due to a “massive number of violations of the (state) constitution, the fact that it happened in the middle of the night, [and] that no constituent had an opportunity to vent or voice their concerns with their public official.”
Critics asserted lawmakers had violated the constitutional prohibition on lawmakers increasing their own compensation. They said a pay increase may not take effect in the same session in which it was approved. Essentially, an incumbent lawmaker must be reelected before benefitting from a vote to increase the legislature’s pay. 
At the time, the General Assembly skirted that requirement by awarding itself “unvouchered expenses,” equivalent to forthcoming salary increases. It also argued the bill’s establishment of annual cost-of-living adjustments violated a state Constitutional mandate requiring compensation to be fixed by law. 
Strong public opposition was evident in protests and rallies, but activists also employed new techniques to get their messages across, including Stilp using a symbolic giant, inflatable pink pig. The anti-incumbency movement also used early social media, relying on Yahoo Groups to post articles criticizing the bill to generate public conversation, Diamond said. 
“It was an amazing amount of public support in an age where we didn’t have the social media we have today,” he told the Capital Star.
The early effects of the movement hit the state Supreme Court first. Justice Russell Nigro became the first and only member of the high court to be denied retention in the November 2005 election.
Protesters gained traction over the next year. PA Clean Sweep recruited 113 candidates to run against sitting legislators in the 2006 primary elections, Diamond said. As a result, 17 senators and nearly one fourth of House lawmakers were defeated.
According to Tim Potts, the movement, and particularly the unseating of a Supreme Court justice, has empowered Pennsylvanians in the long-term to depend on the courts for protection by upholding the Constitution. 
This year, Pennsylvanians will decide whether to retain three Supreme Court justices. Politicians on both sides of the aisle say the outcome could direct the results of cases on important policy issues, such as reproductive rights and marijuana legalization. 
“Voters need to understand that they decide whether we have justices that uphold the Constitution or ignore it. Whether we have justices that can be trusted to protect the people or justices that are mere advisors that political leaders can ignore without consequence,” Potts said.

Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, listens as delegates to the state GOP convention discuss removing his right to vote, along with eight other senators'. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Nine Republican state senators who were stripped of their ability to vote for GOP party leadership during a state convention last month have lodged a protest with the party, requesting the elections be nullified.
In a continuation of a feud that began during the 2025 Legislative session, divisions within the state Republican party were on full display during the June convention.
The nine senators — Jason Ellsworth, Hamilton; Bruce Gillespie, Etheridge; Gregg Hunter, Glasgow; Josh Kassmier, Fort Benton; Gayle Lammers, Hardin; Denley Loge, St. Regis; Wendy McKamey, Great Falls; Russ Tempel, Chester; and Shelley Vance, Belgrade — all broke with the majority of their party in a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation, including the state’s budget. Many bills the Nine championed were priorities of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte’s administration.
The GOP Executive Committee censured the Nine during the session, saying they no longer considered them to represent Republican values. Members of the Nine, however, have argued their views represent the true identity of the GOP.
During the convention, Sen. Barry Usher of Yellowstone County made a motion to approve all credentialed delegates except for the Nine, a motion backed by fellow Freedom Caucus member Rep. Jane Gillette, of Three Forks, and approved by a majority of delegates. The vote to elect Art Wittich as the new party chair and additional members of leadership went forward without the votes from the Nine or their proxies.
The disenfranchised senators “represent the thousands of Montana Republicans committed to Republican values who elected those Senators to speak for them,” states the letter of protest sent by lawyer Joan Mell on behalf of the Nine. “The Republican Party is not the party of extremists. As Senators they had the right to vote and participate in the party process. The wholesale disregard of fundamental party voting rights embodied in the Bylaws may not be left unaddressed.”
The letter requests party leaders reconvene the convention to correct the “parliamentary snafu that left these Senators voiceless and emboldened the Freedom Caucus PAC faction to pursue its manifesto.” Mell further accuses the Freedom Caucus members of “bullying” and “exclusionary tactics through subterfuge, surprise and intimidation.”

When Usher made his motion during the convention, then-party Chairman Don Kaltschmidt ruled it out of order, but Gillette successfully demanded the ruling be put to a vote.
Mell said in her letter that Gillette’s motion should have also been ruled out of order, and requested a response within 10 days.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Montana GOP said: “It’s clear these nine senators represent a small minority within our party. The Montana Republican Party remains focused on empowering conservative voters and advancing the principles Montanans elected us to uphold. The letter has been referred to our legal counsel and the rules committee for review. We’ll have more to say soon.”
Speaking to the Daily Montanan on Tuesday, Mell said that it’s clear in the party bylaws that senators have a right to cast votes in party elections, and to remove that power requires changing the bylaws, not a simple vote during the convention.
“You can’t do that on a whim,” she said.
If a senator wanted to make such a motion, Mell said, they should have put out a notice before the meeting, or convened the rules committee to determine whether such a motion could be made.
“The tragic thing is that they are nine members of the Legislature who have all been elected by Montana voters, to have their voice and vote,” Mell said.
Mell addressed her letter to both the current and former party chair, though she told the Daily Montanan she believes Kaltschmidt has the “burden of acting on it.”
Wittich, who earned 140 votes to Stacey Zinn’s 94, said in remarks following his election that he looked forward to bright days for the party ahead.
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6330-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Trump administration has approved another project in Utah under the president’s national energy emergency declaration, green-lighting the expansion of a facility in Carbon County that will allow for increased oil exports. 
Once it’s completed, the Wildcat Loadout Facility in Helper will be able to load about 100,000 barrels of Uintah Basin oil each day to be shipped via train to refineries in Texas and Louisiana. 
The Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, approved the proposal from Coal Energy Group 2 LLC on July 3 to expand the facility. The proposal includes adding more loading and unloading areas, a tank farm (a site with above-ground tanks to store oil), loading systems and other “related facilities to increase project capacity to transload oil,” according to the BLM. 
The proposal was approved under an accelerated, 14-day environmental review process, part of President Donald Trump’s national energy emergency order declared in January. Using the same process, the administration approved a new uranium mine in southern Utah in May, the first project to be approved under the new guidelines.

The new review expedites a process that in the past has sometimes taken years, and sidesteps public comment.  
Coal Energy Group 2 currently holds a BLM right of way on the 270-acre site, which was issued in 1982 to load coal onto railway cars. But in recent years the site has been used predominantly to load oil, with the coal facilities sitting idle since 2016, according to the BLM. 
The company has tried to expand the site for several years, first applying in 2023. That application was met with opposition from environmental groups and politicians, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Joe Neguse, both Democrats, who penned a letter to the BLM urging them to prepare a broader environmental review. 
Both lawmakers remain opposed to the project, calling it “profoundly flawed” in a June 23 statement. 
“There is no credible energy emergency to justify bypassing public involvement and environmental safeguards. The United States is currently producing more oil and gas than any country in the world,” the statement reads. 
Meanwhile, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office told Colorado Newsline it is considering joining a lawsuit challenging the president’s energy emergency declaration.

Other groups criticized the decision last week, calling it rushed and warning of environmental risks. 
“There is no energy emergency, plain and simple. Hidden behind a shroud of secrecy, the BLM has rushed through its approval of this massive oil shipping expansion project,” said Landon Newell, a staff attorney with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “This thinly analyzed decision threatens the lifeblood of the American Southwest by authorizing the transport of more than one billion gallons annually of additional oil on railcars traveling alongside the Colorado River. Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.” 
“The Trump administration’s refusal to hear community concerns about oil spill risks is pure hubris. Local communities know better than D.C. bureaucrats how this dangerous increase in oil trucking and rail traffic will affect their health and safety,” added Wendy Park with the Center for Biological Diversity. “This fast-tracked review breezed past vital protections for clean air, public safety and endangered species.”
The expansion would take place on 30 acres of “previously disturbed lands” (meaning they’ve been altered in some way) within the 270 acre site, according to the BLM analysis.
Trucks currently bring in oil from the Uinta Basin to the Helper site — the BLM estimates there are 77 truck deliveries at the site per day. The expansion would result in an additional 345 deliveries each day, according to the BLM’s analysis. The facility could now be able to load about 100,000 barrels of crude oil daily, which would be transported to refineries along the Gulf Coast. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The BLM acknowledged in its analysis that the project’s expansion wouldn’t actually mean more oil production in Utah. 
According to the agency, Utah is already under-producing — as of February, the state produces about 182,000 barrels of crude oil each day, despite having a higher capacity. 
The BLM’s analysis states that Salt Lake City’s refineries can only process 80,000 barrels of waxy crude oil (the kind of oil that is largely produced in the Uinta Basin) each day. Additionally, Carbon County can currently load about 180,000 barrels onto railway cars per day, according to the BLM. 
“Therefore, crude oil export capacity currently exceeds crude oil production for the entire state of Utah,” the BLM’s analysis reads. “In other words, a BLM decision to authorize the Wildcat Loadout Facility expansion will not necessarily increase crude oil production in the Uinta Basin (which hinges on overall market forces). Instead, so long as the price of crude oil remains low, production in the Uinta Basin will likely remain static.” 
Expanding the facility will still shift where the loading occurs, the BLM analysis reads, “by providing a more convenient location to transfer crude oil from trucks to rail cars.” 
“Responsible energy development plays a key role in supporting local communities and national priorities,” said BLM Green River District Manager Elijah Waters in a news release. “This project reflects our commitment to advancing critical infrastructure while ensuring careful stewardship of Utah’s public lands.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0678-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

(File photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing, prior to the Biden administration, of roughly 398,000 employees. That would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. The agency announced Monday that the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in spending on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) programs as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
VA secretary says ‘health care and benefits are not being cut’

“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits.
More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

It has 1,000 employees, including 40% who are tribal members, according to the presentation. (Photo courtesy NM legislative presentation)The vice president of a local tribe is asking the New Mexico Attorney General and the state Legislature to intervene against online gambling apps that he says are using a backdoor to allow illegal sports gambling here and, in doing so, threatening tribal gaming rights. 
Mescalero Apache Reservation Vice President Duane Duffy told a panel of state lawmakers this week that platforms like Kalshi allow customers to do online sports betting under the guise of commodity futures trading. The companies are “wiggling” their way into New Mexico, a state where online sports betting is illegal, he said.
“That is a threat to the gaming market here in the state, and a clear violation of the state tribal gaming compacts,” Duffy told members of the interim Economic & Rural Development & Policy Committee on Monday at the tribe’s Inn of the Mountain Gods, which houses its casino. “And so that is something that we are going to have to work together on [to] address.”
He said he and other tribes intend to approach lawmakers ahead of the 30-day legislative session in January to see whether there’s a legislative way to crack down on the companies. He also intends to seek help from the New Mexico Attorney General, he said. 
Duffy did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Neither did Kalshi. 
Lauren Rodriguez, chief of staff  for the New Mexico Attorney General, told Source New Mexico in an email that the office had received a letter from gaming tribes regarding the matter. The office has been in communication with one of the tribes, Sandia Pueblo, regarding Kalshi and the office is “continuing to monitor developments in related lawsuits brought by other states,” she said.

Duffy’s comments come as other states seek help from a federal agency to crack down on the companies, which they say are undermining hard-fought legislation regulating gambling at the state level.
In early June, Arizona’s director of gaming wrote a letter to the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, naming Kalshi as well as Robinhood and Crypto.com as companies that bypass the state’s gambling regulations by pretending they are allowing users to buy “contracts” or engage in “trading” financial products when in effect they are just trying to predict which team will win a sporting match.
“The [companies] claim that their operations enable ‘trading’ of financial derivatives, which is conduct regulated by the [commission],” Johnson wrote. “In truth, there is no meaningful difference between buying one of the contracts offered by the [companies] and placing a bet with any other sportsbook.”
Arizona is among seven states that sent cease-and-desist letters to Kalshi, according to online sports gambling news site SBCAmericas. Several other states have launched investigations, according to the site. 
The tribal gaming compacts between 14 tribes and pueblos in New Mexico result from negotiations between the tribes, the governor’s office and the New Mexico Legislature. The 2015 gaming compact, which is in effect until 2037, requires the parties to reopen “good-faith negotiations” if any “internet gaming” is authorized in New Mexico. 
Mescalero and other tribes cited that provision recently when seeking an official opinion from Torrez about the activities of Jack Pocket, an app that allowed users to buy lottery tickets online. 
In February, Torrez concluded that Jack Pocket’s activities amounted to “internet gaming,” which meant, per the compacts, the state needed to reopen negotiations with the tribes to evaluate its impact. Torrez also determined that Jack Pocket was operating without a necessary authorization from the New Mexico Lottery Association. 
Duffy told the committee Monday that as a result of the AG’s intervention, Jackpocket has “since ceased that operation when it comes to the online lottery sales.”
Growth of sports betting may be linked to financial woes, new studies find

Rodriguez, Torrez’s spokesperson, told Source that while it is monitoring the situation that the office would not be issuing a formal opinion about Kalshi like it did about Jackpocket, because the request for its opinion on the matter did not come from state elected officials like legislators or district attorneys. 
New Mexico Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) asked Duffy to elaborate on what he’s asking the Legislature to do, suggesting he would like to avoid reopening compact negotiations. 
“What’s the solution to this? Because I don’t think we can stop the internet,” Sharer said.
Options Duffy listed include lawsuits and seeking help from the governor’s office, the Legislature or the AG. He told lawmakers he was just putting the issue “in your ear” because the problem would not be going away. 
“There’s no mechanism that exists right now that allows the tribes or racinos to engage in internet gaming, and to have these outside entities from outside the state doing that…it’s taken out of our pockets, sending it out of state,” he said. “And we don’t have that ability then to revenue share to our full potential.”
According to the latest figures, tribal casinos across the state generated more than $219 million in “adjusted net win” in the first quarter of 2025, which includes the amount of money made on gaming machines minus the amount paid out in non-cash prizes. The state received more than $20 million in revenues deposited into the general fund this quarter, as a result. 
Duffy said the Inn of the Mountain Gods and its casino, which generated more than $15 million in the first quarter of 2025, constitute  the tribe’s sole source of revenue, excluding federal and state grants. The casino accounts for a huge part of that, especially as the tribe’s ski resort increasingly loses customers due to reductions in snowpack, he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-at-4.11.22 PM-1024x499.png,,,2025-07-08 19:09:35.964322

Game and Fish reconsiders proposed changes amid a legislative discussion about making special tags saleable — a hugely unpopular idea with sportspeople.
The post Outcry causes Wyoming to back off plan to curb ‘landowner tag’ advantages appeared first on WyoFile .","A week from now, the appointed officials who oversee Wyoming’s wildlife are devoting an extraordinary seven hours to a single agenda item. 
The topic is proposed changes to the state’s system of awarding special hunting tags to landowners. It’s a system that causes some problems. Specifically, in some hunt areas, almost all the licenses available are gobbled up by landowners, leaving the general hunting public empty-handed. 
Wyoming Game and Fish commissioners are allocating an entire day of their Casper meeting to the proposed reforms after seeing landowners’ responses to the changes at presentations given by biologists and wardens this spring around the state. Meetings went late into the evenings, Game and Fish Commissioner Rusty Bell told WyoFile, and public comments, mostly opposing the changes, piled up by the hundreds. 
In response, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reversed course. The department is no longer recommending most major changes, though the decision-making will happen on a higher level, Game and Fish spokeswoman Amanda Fry said.
“Ultimately, it’s up to the commission what happens,” Fry told WyoFile. “Our agency, we can only provide recommendations.”

The changes once being recommended, which were several years in the making, would have made it more difficult for landowners to acquire coveted tags that “come off the top.” That means they’re allocated in advance of the lotteries where rank-and-file public hunters vie for limited opportunities. Before the outcry from landowners, Game and Fish had proposed several big changes: 

Acres owned to qualify for landowner licenses would have quadrupled, going from 160 to 640 acres. (Cultivated land was exempted from the change, and would have remained the same.)
The number of “animal use-days” that must be demonstrated for landowner tag eligibility was proposed to increase from 2,000 to 3,000. 
Wildlife managers also sought to require that landowner tag holders possess “significant interest” in a property or at least 20% ownership of a land-owning corporation, trust or LLC in order to be eligible.

Those proposed regulation changes are all no longer being recommended, according to a “public comment summary and response” memo that agency staff sent the Game and Fish Commission on June 19.  The memo shows that about 70% of the 380 comments the department received opposed the proposed changes. Just 9% of respondents stated support. 
One reform is still being recommended. Notably, it will make it easier for big game and turkey hunters to acquire landowner tags. Specifically, the definition of “immediate family member” would be expanded to include “step-parents,” “step-grandparents,” “step-siblings” and “step-children” in order to accommodate blended families. 
The changes to landowner licenses that were being pursued dated back to the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, which was co-chaired by Josh Coursey and Rusty Bell, who’s now a Game and Fish commissioner. During the group’s 2021 and 2022 meetings, the public learned that in some hunting areas, the majority of coveted licenses for quarry like bull elk were ending up in the hands of landowners. The meetings also highlighted that properties were being subdivided into 160-acre parcels for the purpose of owners obtaining more hunting licenses for friends or family.

In Wyoming, landowner licenses date to 1949. They can only be used by an applicant or an immediate family member. Apart from the acreage requirement, landowners must provide habitat for the applicable species: elk, deer, pronghorn or wild turkeys. Recipients — who are capped at two licenses for each species, good throughout the hunt area — are supposed to prove that they’re providing that habitat via the “animal use days” condition (e.g., 2,000 elk on their property for a single day or 20 mule deer for 100 days.) 
The Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, charged with addressing the top-priority wildlife policy issues facing the state, was unable to agree on recommendations for landowner tag reforms. 
In 2023 and 2024, however, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department hosted a series of public meetings about the topic. Then in November 2024, the agency’s commissioners directed the department to craft proposed regulations. 
In the meantime, the Wyoming Legislature got involved.

During the Legislature’s 2025 general session, Kemmerer Republican Sen. Laura Pearson introduced a bill, Senate File 118, “Landowner hunting tags-amendments,” that would have allowed landowners to sell their landowner tags via an open market — a structure other western states allow, where the tags often fetch big bucks. Hunting organizations lobbying in Cheyenne worried that the bill would create more interest in the landowner license program, exacerbating problems that already exist for public hunters disadvantaged by the current system.
Pearson pulled back her bill. But already, landowner licenses have been broached in two legislative committees during the interim period ahead of the 2026 budget session. Dave True, a Natrona County rancher, pitched an idea in June to the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee that would allow for landowner licenses to be saleable under certain conditions, such as by those who possess at least 2,000 acres.
The transferable tag idea also came up at a June meeting of the Agriculture, State and Public Lands & Water Resources Committee. Tempers flared, the Powell Tribune reported.
Prior to his appointment to the body, Rusty Bell testified to the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission in January 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Bell, the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce co-chair who’s now a Game and Fish commissioner, told WyoFile that he believes the Legislature is where the “best solutions” are going to come from. He specified that he spoke only for himself. 
“Something that the Legislature can take up … is allowing the [Game and Fish] commission to put a cap on the amount of landowner tags in any given area,” Bell said.
But Bell also warned that a firestorm awaits if lawmakers hit the gas on making landowner tags saleable. During his time on the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, he heard and reviewed hundreds of public comments that revealed what resident sportspeople make of the idea. 
“It will change the landscape of hunting in Wyoming forever — that’s what we got back from that public comment,” Bell said. “It’s not going to go over well with sportsmen. It’s going to go over just about as well as selling our public lands.”

Legislative leaders have appointed 11 lawmakers and education officials to the School Redistricting Task Force to craft new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system.
The task force was created by H.454, now called Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill that Gov. Phil Scott signed into law this month. Six lawmakers and five former superintendents and school business managers have been appointed to the task force.
The appointees plan to work to consolidate Vermont’s 119 school districts — contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
These new larger districts would oversee a minimum of 4,000 prekindergarten through grade 12 students, but no more than 8,000 students “to the extent practical,” according to the law.

Three lawmakers and two former school officials were nominated by Senate and House leadership, while one member was appointed by Scott.
One day after signing the education reform bill into law, Scott appointed Dave Wolk, the former state senator and the longtime president of Castleton University, to serve as his lone appointee on the task force.
Wolk has previously served as a principal at both Barstow Memorial School and Rutland High School, and the superintendent of schools in Rutland City.
Scott said in a press release that Wolk’s experience in education and the Legislature “will bring an important perspective to this work and will prioritize what’s best for our kids.”
Wolk said in the release that he plans to “approach the Task Force with an open mind, knowing that the results of the endeavor are not likely to be popular or widely embraced across the state.”
“But it is important work, with a short timeline, and it must be done thoughtfully, with a focus on what is best for all of our students and educators, as well as Vermont taxpayers,” Wolk said. “It will be very challenging but very necessary, for the benefit of Vermont.”
This week, leadership from the House and Senate announced their own picks.
The Senate Committee on Committees — composed of Sens. Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, and Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, along with Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers — appointed Dr. Jennifer Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District, and Chris Locarno, a retired director of finance and facilities for the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Senate leadership also appointed Sens. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia; Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central; and Wendy Harrison, D-Windham to the task force.
“I look forward to working with colleagues to create an educational landscape that is right-sized and provides equity within a thriving public education system,” Gulick said.
Beck, the Republican minority leader, was one of three senators who along with three House members helped craft the final contours of H.454 before being sent to Scott.
He’s drawn the ire from public education advocates for his association with private schools, called independent schools under state law. (Beck is a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy).
Last month, Beck and Sen. Seth Bongartz were accused in ethics complaints of using their positions to advance provisions that benefited the private schools they are associated with.
In a press release, Beck said he was looking forward to “this important work and providing Vermont students from all corners of Vermont with an excellent education.”
On Tuesday, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, announced her appointment of Reps. Edye Graning, D-Chittenden-3; Beth Quimby, R-Caledonia-2; and Rebecca Holcombe, D-Windsor Orange-2, to the task force.
Krowinski also appointed Jay Badams, a former superintendent, and Kim Gleason, a former school board member.
Krowsinki, announcing her appointments in a press release, said the task force “is an important step in building a public education system that is more equitable, more sustainable and more responsive to the needs of students and communities.”
Gleason, a former member of the State Board of Education, said she was grateful for the opportunity “to represent the important voices of school boards in governance and community engagement as these systemic changes in the Vermont education landscape are being considered.”
During its first meeting later this summer, the task force plans to select two co-chairs from among its members — one from the House and one from the Senate.
The body is then expected to finalize and deliver new school district maps to the Legislature by Dec. 1. Lawmakers then expect to take up the new maps for consideration during next year’s session, which begins in January.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 22:28:01+00:00,CT Mirror,"Defying lawmakers, DEEP opts to keep Wallingford transfer station closed",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/deep-wallingford-transfer-station-permit/,"CT Dept of Energy and Environmental Protection said it won't issue transfer station permit, a move that puts agency at odds with language in budget bill.","Attempts to reopen a shuttered garbage transfer station in Wallingford cannot go forward for the time being, state officials said this week, despite a provision in the state budget that directed Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration to sign off on the plan.
On Monday, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said it would not issue a temporary operating permit to the owners of the transfer station, which had been subject to several complaints and violations before it closed in 2023.
The decision puts the agency at odds with controversial language inserted into the state’s sprawling budget bill — also known as the “implementer” — that directed officials to issue the permit while the facility’s owners completed a formal application to reopen the transfer station.
“In consultation with the Office of the Governor and the Office of the Attorney General, the State has determined that the provision of the budget implementer bill concerning the ‘Wallingford Transfer Station’ cannot be acted upon as drafted and does not provide the Department the authority to issue a ‘temporary operating permit,'” DEEP spokesman James Fowler said in a statement. “The Department will continue to work to resolve open violations of state statutes and regulations at that facility.”
Fowler has previously said the agency was not involved with drafting the language regarding the permit, which also appeared to catch several lawmakers off guard before it was added into the budget two days before the end of the legislative session.
Still, the proposal became law when Gov. Lamont signed the budget on June 30.
The transfer station is owned by Country Holdings LLC. An attorney for the company, Joseph Mazzarella, on Monday accused DEEP of flouting the plain language of the law and said he would consider taking legal action to force the agency to issue the permit.
“It says what it says, and it seems to me they’re going through extraordinary gyrations to try to avoid complying with the law,” Mazzarella said. 
Mazzarella previously told the Connecticut Mirror that he was involved in getting the the permit language included in the budget on behalf of Country Holdings’ owner, Richard Antonucci Jr. In addition to the Wallingford property, the amendment also blocked the proposed sale of a transfer station in Torrington by conveying its operating permit to a recently-established public waste authority.
According to Mazzarella, both provisions offered a boost to Antonucci’s plans to compete against another hauler, USA Waste and Recycling, which he argued has already consolidated its control over much of the state’s waste business.
“How can that be good?” Mazzarella told CT Mirror in an interview last month.
But several lawmakers have since said they had no knowledge of the language addressing the transfer stations — or its origins — before they were asked to vote on the budget.
State Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said he was surprised when he saw the language for the first time in an amendment to the budget bill that passed the House on June 2. “I represent Wallingford, I think maybe I would’ve known about this,” he said, according to a video of the debate.
Fishbein’s colleague, State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, said the language amounted to a legislative “rat” — a pejorative term used by lawmakers to describe ideas that are included in the budget without going through an public hearing. On Monday, she praised DEEP’s decision not to go ahead with issuing a temporary permit for the property.
“It’s a wise move for now,” Mushinsky said. “We should never run stuff in the budget implementer that hasn’t been run by somebody.”
Wallingford’s mayor, Vinny Cervoni, also expressed disappointment in the process through which the language made its way into the budget. He said he only learned about it from lawmakers after the fact. And he said he was supportive of DEEP’s decision to allow for a regular review process before approving any new permits for the facility.
“The facility really, to put it politely, is in a state of disrepair,” Cervoni said. 
Country Holdings acquired the transfer station in 2019 from Covanta, which had previously operated a waste-to-energy incinerator on the property. At the time of the sale, daily operations at the transfer station were being contracted out to another company, Country Disposal Services, which had the necessary permits to operate the facility.
That arrangement continued for several years until disagreements between the two companies led Country Holdings to fire Country Disposal in early 2023. (Mazzarella said the two companies are not related, despite their similar names.)
In July of that year, DEEP issued notices of violations to both companies after determining that Country Holdings had continued to operate the facility without a valid permit. 
The notices also documented a number of problems at the site including an excessive buildup of trash, improper storage and a failure to inspect waste coming into the facility. In addition, as a result of “numerous” fires on the property, DEEP ordered an engineer to inspect the structural integrity of the buildings.
Those notices remain unresolved as of this week, the agency said. 
“The Department has concerns about the physical condition of the facility to accept solid waste,” DEEP’s Fowler said in a statement. “The facility has been prone to fires in the past, and is believed to be in poor physical condition, including gaps and voids in the walls and ceilings that expose solid waste to stormwater and vectors. … These violations must be addressed — through execution of a consent order or otherwise.  The Department has consistently encouraged the owners of the facility to address the open violations and seek a permit to operate through the Department’s standard process.”
The owner of Country Disposal, Michael Couden, declined to comment about his past involvement in the property on Tuesday.
Mazzarella, however, said that the issues largely stemmed from Country Disposal’s operation of the transfer station. After taking over the facility, he said Country Holdings notified DEEP about its problems and began working to clean up the site before being hit with violations.
“We were operating under the presumption that we were doing the right thing,” Mazzarella said. “It’s a Catch-22, that’s the whole issue in a nutshell.”
In response, Fowler said that notifying authorities of problems at the transfer station did not absolve the owners of their responsibilities. 
“As the property owner, Country Holdings is still subject to the laws and regulations governing the operation of the facility,” Fowler said. “Violations occurred on their property under its control, and Country Holdings operated the facility even though it did not hold the required permit to do so.”
Cervoni, the mayor, said he had spoken with the owners of Country Holdings about their plans for the site — which include the potential development of modern waste-to-energy technologies — and that he was “not unsympathetic” to their frustrations. Still, he said he wants to take more time to understand the company’s proposals and for officials to resolve any outstanding issues at the property.
“We could use the facility for disposal of our local waste, but at the same time the whole thing should occur through the normal process,” Cervoni said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA  — A Leavenworth County District Court judge held off on a decision Monday on whether to lift a temporary restraining order he placed on CoreCivic last month, stopping the company from housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees at its vacant Leavenworth prison.
Judge John Bryant said he would take CoreCivic’s motion to reconsider the temporary restraining order “under advisement.” He ordered the city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic to finalize the wording for the temporary restraining order.
Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager, said there were no rulings issued from the hearing, although the judge did hear arguments from both parties on whether or not to reconsider the temporary restraining order.
In a June hearing, Bryant placed a temporary restraining order on CoreCivic to keep the company from accepting ICE detainees until a case could be settled between the city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic. The parties are at odds over whether CoreCivic has to go through the city’s development process to receive a special use permit before reopening the prison, which was closed in 2021.CoreCivic has sought to reopen the facility as the Midwest Regional Reception Center. The company asked the judge to reconsider the temporary restraining order, revealing it had a contract with ICE that would pay $4.2 million per month to house immigrants in its vacant Leavenworth facility.

(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

(chuchart duangdaw / Getty Photos)Ahead of New Mexico’s next 60-day legislative session in 2027, the interim Tobacco Settlement Revenue Oversight Committee on Monday strategized about how to best approach raising taxes on electronic nicotine products.
While New Mexico law imposes a 25% tax on traditional tobacco products, the tax on e-cigarettes is half that: 12.5%.
For the last two years, New Mexico lawmakers have tried to amend the state Tobacco Control Act to say anything that is nicotine derived should be taxed like other nicotine products, American Heart Association lobbyist Mahesh Sita told the committee.
In the most recent legislative session, state Rep. Elizabeth “Liz” Thomson and Sen. Martin Hickey, both Albuquerque Democrats, carried a bill that would have raised taxes on all nicotine products to 40%.
The state Senate and the House Health and Human Services Committee passed the bill, but it did not receive a final vote in the House Taxation and Revenue Committee.
The 2026 legislative session, the last regular session under Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, is a short session, meaning lawmakers can only consider pieces of legislation approved by the governor on her “call,” or deemed “germane” to the state government budget.
“There is a new session coming up — it is a call session, so things may be more difficult — but we’re planning out for the following session,” Hickey said on Monday.
Thomson asked Sita and Linda Siegle, a lobbyist for the Cancer Action Network, about other states that have passed legislation for regulating not just existing nicotine products but also those that the industry may come up with in the future.
Thomson said the tobacco industry stays “miles, not just steps” ahead of lawmakers.
“By the time we get a bill done, with the language, they’ve left us in the dust,” she said.
Sita said the latest tobacco products are synthetic, so the tobacco industry argues they can’t be taxed as tobacco. However, Sita argued they should be, since they are derived from nicotine.
“Other states have done it, and the new products — the chews and the like — with a high content of nicotine, have very addictive properties,” Sita said.
Sita pointed to California and Massachusetts as examples, and said his organization has proposed a uniform taxing system on all nicotine products based on their wholesale value, comparable to the existing cigarette tax.
Officials from the New Mexico Department of Health Nicotine Use Prevention and Control program presented data to the committee showing that in 2023, more than a third of New Mexicans aged 18 to 29 years used some kind of nicotine product, while 22% of high school students and nearly 13% of middle school students used them.
Hickey said the greatest inhibitor to young people starting to use nicotine is cost, and Siegle said making e-cigarettes’ cost comparable to traditional tobacco is probably the best approach to curbing young people’s use.
“The e-cigarette market is rapidly evolving,” Siegle said. “Now there are all these other products out there, I don’t even know what we’re taxing on them — if we’re taxing them, because they’re not listed in our statute.”

Trump signed the bill on July 4. Every Republican member of Michigan’s U.S. House delegation voted to pass the legislation, which made it through the House 218-214.
That includes U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who is running for governor.
“We’re cutting taxes on tips and overtime, protecting Social Security, rebuilding American manufacturing, and putting an end to handouts for illegal immigrants and able-bodied adults who won’t work,” James wrote in a statement shared on X. “This bill secures our border, strengthens our economy, and keeps our word to the American people.”
Two of James’ constituents, Warren residents Kyle Johnson and Taylor Johnson, participated in a virtual press conference for the Michigan Democratic Party on Tuesday.
Their six-year-old son, who they adopted when he was three weeks old, has Down syndrome.
While Taylor Johnson said he is an otherwise healthy six-year old, she added that “even the healthiest child with Down syndrome needs a lot more support than a child without Down syndrome.”
He has a heart defect, sleep apnea, takes a daily medication to manage his hypothyroidism, wears ankle braces and goes to speech therapy every week, “because school can’t do all of the therapies that are needed to support a child with a disability all the time.”
Most of that is covered by Medicaid, she said.
“George is having a healthy, happy childhood because his medical needs and because all of the things that he needs to thrive are so well supported,” Johnson said. “And that is not in spite of his disability. That is because of access to Medicaid and great quality health care.”
But she said while the full extent of how they will be affected by the law remains vague, some cuts – like what is deemed necessary to be covered by Medicaid – are already clear, and will affect things like their son’s speech therapy, which Hertel called “a basic tenant of quality of life.”
Taylor Johnson and Kyle Johnson visited Washington, DC, in May as guests of U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor). She says they visited James’ office, but only a staffer would meet with them.
“He looked at our six-year-old son and said we are in support of cutting waste, fraud and abuse,” Taylor Johnson said. “So we’re just here as parents to tell everybody that George is not waste, fraud and abuse. He’s a child. He’s an American. He’s trying to live a happy, healthy American childhood, and in order to do that, he needs extra support.”
Kyle Johnson added that James is “supposed to be our Congressman, but I don’t feel like he is. I feel like he’s the administration – he’s Trump’s Congressman. Because he’s made it very clear that he doesn’t actually want to serve the needs of his constituents like George. He wants to pander to and be a sycophant for the administration.”
He said it’s important for people to share the stories of how they will be impacted by the legislation so that people understand its implications.
“People like Congressman James don’t want you to hear these stories. They want the victims of their actions to remain nameless and storyless, because without the context of stories like George’s, it’s really easy to say things like ‘trimming the fat,’” Johnson said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-181325-1024x571.png,,,2025-07-08 19:09:35.964322

Caledonia County State’s Attorney Jessica Zaleski plans to resign as the county’s top prosecutor on July 25. 
The Caledonian Record first reported the decision last week. 
In an interview, Zaleski said the choice was sparked by a desire to move closer to her parents in North Dakota. She’s tapped Claire Burns, a deputy state’s attorney, to take over the office in an interim capacity. 
State’s attorneys in Vermont are elected every four years. Following a resignation, the local political party of the resigning prosecutor submits names to the governor for consideration. The governor then appoints a replacement — typically from the list of suggested candidates. 
Though she cited family reasons for her departure, Zaleski noted that “everything” about the job had changed during her tenure, making the work more challenging.

“The caseload, the volume of violent crime — particularly homicides — the inability to properly staff the office in a way that controls and manages the workload,” she said.
The judicial system would benefit from more staff in all roles, Zaleski said, including defense attorneys and judges.
Vermont’s stubborn court backlog, exacerbated during Covid-19, has been a constant focus for prosecutors, the defense bar and lawmakers in recent years. 
According to data from the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, most prosecutors have more than 200 criminal cases on their docket. Since the end of 2023, the number of pending homicide dockets statewide has increased by about 30%, from 90 to 117, as of May. Zaleski’s office has prosecuted a number of high-profile shootings and homicides, including a case involving a 15-year-old charged with second-degree murder last year. 
Caledonia County has the second most severe case backlog in the state, according to state data, measured by the percent of pending cases older than the state’s disposition guidelines recommend.

Reflecting on the challenges she’s encountered on the job, Zaleski cited frustrations with Vermont’s juvenile justice system, particularly the lack of a secure detention facility for children and youth offenders. In the rural Northeast Kingdom, accessing resources — like mental health and substance use treatment — is a constant concern for community members, she said. 
Despite the job’s difficulties, the prosecutor said there was much to enjoy about her work. 
“The experience generally has been exhausting but incredibly fulfilling. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done under incredible pressure and lack of resources,” she said. 
Zaleski is one of at least three prosecutors to leave office in the past year. Former Windham County State’s Attorney Tracy Kelly Shriver stepped down mid-term in July 2024. Last month, longtime Windham County Deputy State’s Attorney David Gartenstein retired.

Paul Cornelius, the DOC chief of staff, said in an email to the Iowa Capital Dispatch that the request for proposal, or RFP, is meant to “explore future options for health care delivery and to replace our current electronic health record system.”
“This is an exploratory step — no final decisions have been made, and no immediate changes are planned for staff or services,” Cornelius wrote. “The goal is to evaluate how we can best meet long-term health care needs while continuing to provide high-quality care.”
The RFP has not been posted publicly, but the department intends to look at private companies to provide health services in Iowa’s correctional facilities. According to reporting from the Gazette, an email sent from the DOC to its medical staff stated this change is a response to ongoing challenges with staff shortages, the rising costs of pharmaceutical drugs and transportation, and a need to expand the system’s mental health and substance abuse treatment capabilities.
The privatization of health care in Iowa’s prisons would hurt the care providers currently working for the DOC, Todd Copley, president of AFSCME Council 61, said.
“This is a slap in the face to the public employees who’ve kept Iowa’s correctional health system running through crisis after crisis,” Copley said. “Instead of investing in the frontline workers already doing the job, the state wants to hand it off to a private contractor. That’s not a solution, it’s a mistake.”
Under the proposal outlined in the email to staff, all health care workers in the DOC system would be employed by the company contracted to provide care should the department decide to award a contract. Copley said this is cause for concern because current DOC workers could see pay cuts if they are offered to keep their position, and because these health care professionals would no longer have access to Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS), the state’s public pension system, as they would no longer be public employees.
While labor advocates opposed contracting out health care work in state correctional facilities, AFSCME 61 stated in was supportive of another part of the plan — updating the DOC’s electronic health record system. While updates to the record system are “long overdue,” Copley opposed tying these upgrades to workforce changes, saying the move “risks disrupting care, weakening accountability, and undermining staffing.”
Instead of pursuing privatization, Copley called for the state leaders to use funds from the state’s budget reserves toward better pay for health care staff and system upgrades.
“The governor has bragged about a $1.8 billion surplus,” Copley said. “If that’s not enough to upgrade systems and pay a competitive wage to public healthcare workers, then what are we saving it for?”
While Iowa has built up a sizable surplus over several years, Republicans at the Iowa statehouse are planning to use those funds in part to finance the implementation of recent tax cuts. In the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers approved a $9.425 billion budget, spending more than the projected $8.5 billion in revenue for Fiscal Year 2026. This shortfall was made up for by drawing from the state reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and remaining balance from previous years.
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, said the RFP to privatize health care in Iowa’s correctional facilities is due to Republicans’ budgeting decisions, saying the move would be a “costly mistake.”
“We shouldn’t be surprised that Republican leaders are once again making Iowa workers pay the price for their poor budgeting decisions by privatizing healthcare at the Iowa Department of Corrections,” Brown-Powers said. “It’s part of a disturbing pattern of short-sighted choices as Republican lawmakers continue to ruin the state’s finances and spend more than available revenue, which hurts working families and costs the state more in the long run.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/health-care-stethoscope-cash-_-Getty-RF-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sentenced four foreign nationals, two of whom admitted to illegal reentry and two for possession of fraudulent immigration documents, to time served in prison and remanded them to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, according to the Montana U.S. Attorney’s office.
U.S. District Judge Brian M. Molloy presided over all four cases.
Two Mexican citizens, Francisco Alcocer-Sanchez, 62, and Luis Alberto Vega-Lili, 57, pleaded guilty in May 2025 to single counts of use or possession of fraudulent immigration documents.
According to press releases from the U.S. Attorney’s office, law enforcement made contact with Vega-Lili on a train in Havre in March.
The government alleged in court documents that when Vega-Lili spoke to Border Patrol agents, he acknowledged his Mexican citizenship and that he did not have immigration paperwork to enter or remain in the United States. He provided a Mexican passport issued in North Carolina.
Further investigation by law enforcement found that in 2008, Vega-Lili submitted an incomplete application for naturalization because he was married to a U.S. citizen, but she since passed away, per the U.S. Attorney’s office.
The government further alleged that during a security search of Vega-Lili’s cell, agents found a fraudulent Social Security card and fraudulent permanent resident card in the sole of his boot containing information belonging to a person from India, born in 1973 and living in Texas.
In the other case, court documents say that law enforcement agents arrested Acocer-Sanchez on Feb. 28, in Fairview, Montana/McKenzie County, North Dakota during a DUI stop. Alcocer-Sanchez provided an expired licensed permanent resident card with his picture, but another name and alien number. Law enforcement noticed the card was missing security features and the next day verified his true identity and a prior removal from the United States. He later acknowledged his Mexican citizenship and and illegal status in America.
According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, Alcocer-Sanchez’s immigration history shows he was granted status as a lawful permanent resident on Feb. 12, 1991, but that status was revoked on June 25, 1998, following his conviction for importing cocaine, an aggravated felony. There is no record he applied for readmission into the United States.
The two men were sentenced to time served of 121 and 131 days in prison, respectively, and remanded to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol upon release, according to U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme.
 Illegal reentry 

In two additional Monday press releases, Alme said that two foreign nationals had been sentenced to time served for illegal reentry and also remanded to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.
A Mexican citizen, Jose Luz Rojas-Flores, 35, and a Honduran citizen, Enys Jose Rosales-Lara, 39, each pleaded guilty in May to one count of illegal reentry.
According to court documents, Rojas-Flores was removed from the United States in 2012, again in 2013 after serving a 30-day sentence for illegal reentry, and again in 2015 after serving a 60-day sentence.
The press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said that in April 2025, the Havre Police Department encountered five individuals during a traffic stop, none of whom spoke English and all of which had Mexican identification documents. Rojas-Flores had no documents permitting him to enter or remain in the U.S., and he later admitted to crossing into the country near El Paso, Texas, in 2020.
According to Alme, also in April, law enforcement conducting a traffic stop in Havre found Rosales-Lara, who possessed a Honduran Identification Card but no additional documents. He admitted to entering the U.S. in late 2023 near El Paso, Texas, and that he had no lawful right to remain in the United States.
The two men were sentenced to time served of 73 and 74 days, respectively, according to Alme.
The two cases were part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that mandates the Department of Justice to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators violent crime.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/borderpatrolcar-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Every dollar the Oklahoma Legislature invests in the state’s public higher education system produces over $17 in economic output, a new study found. 
Oklahoma public higher education supported over 111,000 jobs either directly or indirectly and  produced over $460 million in tax revenue at state, county and local levels, according to the study published by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. The regents contracted with the University of Cincinnati Economics Center to conduct the study. 
“The state regents and our public colleges and universities remain focused on producing successful graduates that fulfill Oklahoma’s evolving workforce needs,” said Regent Dennis Casey in a statement. “The $14.61 billion total economic impact of our state system clearly shows that public higher education is integral to Oklahoma’s continued economic growth.”
Over the past decade, the number of Oklahomans over 25 with an associate degree or higher grew more than 5%. 
Median annual earnings also increased with degree level earned. In 2023, people with less than a high school diploma had a median annual earning of $30,185. Those with a bachelor’s degree earned a median $57,336, while a graduate or professional degree earned $71,642. 
Almost 94% of resident undergraduate students were employed in Oklahoma one year after graduation. Over 61% of non-resident graduates stayed in Oklahoma and entered the Oklahoma workforce. 
“Oklahoma’s public institutions play a crucial role in shaping the workforce, driving innovation, and advancing economic development,” said Chancellor Sean Burrage. “Our Blueprint 2030 strategic plan prioritizes aligning academic programs to meet employment needs, with the goal to produce more educators, engineers, computer scientists, and nurses.”
Blueprint 2030 is the strategic plan by the regents to produce workforce-ready graduates, focus on student success and improve system efficiency and effectiveness.
Every dollar invested in the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship program generates $5.88 in economic output, according to the study. Oklahoma’s Promise offers qualified Oklahoma students an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition. 
One year after graduation, over 94% of Oklahoma’s Promise graduates were employed in the state and after five years that number was 86%. 
Graduates of Oklahoma’s Promise earned over $197 million in wages in 2023, compared to the $171 million in wages earned by graduates who didn’t go through the program.
The last economic impact study was released in 2019 using 2016 data. A spokesperson for the state regents said studies like this are generally conducted every five to 10 years because of the time required for data collection and analysis.

Missy Irvin of Mountain View said during a Game and Fish/State Police Subcommittee meeting on July 8, 2025 that she wanted to have more conversations about emergency preparedness in Arkansas after devastating flash floods in Texas killed over 100 people last week. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas lawmaker said Tuesday that she wants a legislative subcommittee to focus on emergency preparedness for flooding in light of the disastrous flooding in Texas that had killed at least 109 people as of Tuesday afternoon.
Such a discussion is “really critical at this time,” Sen. Missy Irving, R-Mountain View, said during a meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Game and Fish/State Police subcommittee.
Flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas occurred last weekend in an area popular with campers. Camp Mystic, which serves young girls, saw more than two dozen of its campers and counselors killed in the disaster, along with its longtime director and co-owner, CBS reported. 
The river rose rapidly early Friday morning after a storm system parked itself over the region, dumping heavy rain. The river rose over 25 feet in two hours, according to a stream gauge close to Camp Mystic. 
Irvin, co-chair of the Arkansas subcommittee, said she knew the Texas floods were on the minds of many legislators, especially given the Camp Albert Pike flood that killed 20 people in Arkansas 15 years ago.
“In future meetings I really want to focus on emergency communication, the lack of cell phone coverage in many areas of the state of Arkansas, and really work with our federal delegation, with our FCC [Federal Communications Commission] commissioner — bringing those people in and seeing what we can do to really push the ball forward to make sure that we have good warnings in place,” Irvin said. 
County government is also an important piece of the warning and response puzzle that must be accounted for, Irvin said.
Mike Hagar, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, which oversees both the Arkansas State Police and the Division of Emergency Management, said his department was looking into what it could do “more proactively” on emergency preparedness in conjunction with the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism.
“Unfortunately, the world that we live in and the arena that we all work under — we typically are more reactive, after-the-fact. We’re reactive; once the disaster happens, that’s when we assign resources to come in and try to mitigate that disaster as much as possible,” Hagar said. “Obviously, we need to do better. They say if it’s predictable, it’s preventable.”

(Courtesy of Centers for Control and Prevention) New Mexico health and veterinary officials urged the public to prevent mosquito breeding and protect against bites after officials detected the West Nile virus in insect populations in Bernalillo County last week.
Mosquitos, which require blood for their breeding cycle, spread West Nile virus by biting infected birds and then biting humans or horses—mostly in the summer. No vaccines exist for people, nor do specific treatments for the infection.
No West Nile cases in humans have emerged so far, New Mexico State Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps told Source NM.
“We typically start to see cases in July and August,” she said. “We have not yet seen a case this year, but that’s not unusual. It’s a little too early to stay if that portends a more mild season.”
New Mexico has had more than 500 recorded cases of West Nile since 2005, and at least one death recorded in all but two of the years. New Mexico’s most severe year occurred in 2023, with 80 recorded cases and eight deaths. While multiple species of mosquito can spread the disease, the Culex family of mosquito, which can live anywhere in the state, is the main culprit.
The majority of people who experience the infection have no symptoms, while about 10% to 20% of people experience fevers, muscle aches or headaches.
“Those are often undiagnosed because they mimic any other common illness,” Phipps said.
Only about 1% of the cases progress to a more severe stage, called a neurologic infection, Phipps said, which causes seizures, disorientation and profound weakness, potentially leading to permanent disability or even death.
“While it’s relatively rare, it’s very serious so we encourage everyone to take the prevention measures that they’re able to to decrease their risk of infection,” Phipps said.
An approved vaccine does exist for horses, which can also suffer brain swelling or other complications from contracting the disease. The New Mexico Department of Agriculture reported 19 cases of West Nile in horses in 2023, resulting in six fatalities.
“Vaccinating horses against West Nile virus is one of the most effective steps owners can take to protect their animals during mosquito season,” New Mexico State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Holeck said in a statement. “Prevention through vaccination is far safer – and often less costly – than trying to treat the horse after infection.”
New Mexico state law delegates mosquito control to municipal and county officials, but Phipps said residents can take some additional measures to minimize bites and breeding spaces for the insects. Those include wearing loose-fitting clothing, using insect repellents and avoiding being outside at dusk and dawn.
Mosquitos can lay eggs in very small bodies of standing water — think the amount in a bottle cap — and larvae can transform into adults in as soon as a week. Phipps encouraged changing standing water at least every week, and removing any debris that could collect water.
“Now is the perfect time to start thinking about West Nile, because prevention is key,” Phipps said.

Ian Masters, R-Berkeley.","Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, sits in a meeting of the House Public Heath subcommittee on March 5, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Several clergy leaders in Monongalia County are calling on House Speaker Roger Hanshaw to “conduct a full investigation” into how an antisemitic comment was made by a personal Instagram account belonging to Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley.
In addition to the comment — which Masters has denied making — the clergy leaders are also asking Hanshaw, R-Clay, to look into the account’s profile picture, which features symbols associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs.
“As clergy, we condemn antisemitism in the strongest terms possible,” the letter reads. “… Jewish people have been the subject of horrific violence and oppression by governmental actors over the centuries, including in the United States. Whether Delegate Masters is indeed the one who made these comments deserves thorough scrutiny.”
The clergymembers who signed onto the letter include: Rabbi Joseph Hample, Tree of Life Congregation; Rev. Jenny Williams, United Methodist; Rev. Zac Morton, First Presbyterian Church; Pastor Stephen Prince, United Methodist; Rev. Stephen Lowe, Morgantown Church of the Brethren — Mennonite and Pastor Teresa Prince, United Methodist.
The comment the clergymembers are referring to was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Masters has denied making the comment since West Virginia Watch first reported the story on June 24. At that time, he said he didn’t have “any active Instagram” account and didn’t acknowledge any affiliation with the handle @NoQuarterMasters.
When the comment was made, the account still used Masters’ full name and was previously tagged and featured in photos of Masters posted by other public Instagram pages.
On June 27, House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan issued a news release saying he obtained “definitive proof” showing Masters did not make the comment. He did not release the proof upon request. 
In their letter to Hanshaw on Tuesday, the Monongalia County clergymembers said the release from McGeehan “evoked antisemitic tropes” as the Majority Leader specifically called out Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish members of the state Legislature. 
After the two asked for an investigation into Masters’ social media and his resignation if the allegations were true, McGeehan said they were “not interested in the truth” and were making “deceptive accusations” because they “desire power and social status at the expense of others.”
“There is a long and terrible history of painting Jewish people as deceptive, power-hungry sub-humans who use trickery to advance their agendas,” the clergymembers wrote. “These stereotypes have been used again and again to justify some of the worst atrocities in human history.” 
Last week, McGeehan and Masters gave separate interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively to WRNR TV regarding the comment and the allegations against Masters. WRNR is owned by another member of the House Republican caucus, Del. Mike Hornby, R-Berkeley, according to the Secretary of State.
McGeehan said he personally investigated the incident and found the person responsible: A “basically homeless” man with an unnamed illness and substance use disorder who was “probably going to eventually die in the near future.” 
Masters, McGeehan said, gave the man his old inactive iPhone in 2024 but left his social media accounts — including Instagram — logged in. The man used Masters’ account, McGeehan said, to leave the comment.
In his interview the next day, Masters reiterated McGeehan’s explanation, though in less crass terms. The man, he said, was a friend of his late brothers and he wanted to help him while he was struggling. His name has not been released. 
The profile picture on the page showing symbols burnt into wooden pendants, Masters said, was his and was a “memorial” to his late brother, who loved Norse mythology. The symbols shown included several classified by the Anti-Defamation League as being affiliated with antisemitic beliefs, including the Wolfsangel, which was was appropriated by Nazi Germany as the divisional insignia for several Waffen-SS units and is currently used in the logo for the Aryan Nations in the U.S. and Europe.
Outside of McGeehan, leaders for the West Virginia House Republicans have not commented on the allegations against Masters. The state Democratic Party — led by Pushkin — has requested a “legitimate” investigation into the matter. 
McGeehan said last week that the matter was settled due to his investigation. 
“This is over as far as I’m concerned,” McGeehan said. “… There’s a lot of things that would go into [an official investigation] and I’m not going to have some sort of witch hunt. I’ve done due diligence.”
In their letter to Hanshaw, the clergymembers from Monongalia County said McGeehan has “waived off the scandal” and that his own investigation is not an appropriate conclusion given the allegations at hand.
“McGeehan stated publicly that he has looked into the matter and that he will not further pursue what he is alleging has taken place: the federal crime of impersonating a lawmaker. He has also stated that he is a longtime friend of Delegate Masters,” the clergymembers wrote. “For these reasons we believe he is unable to impartially and fully investigate the matter. We are calling upon [Hanshaw] to initiate a full, impartial investigation to right the prejudiced wrongs being perpetuated by members of the House.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ian-Masters-20250305.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo MDT)The only public rest area along a nearly 100-mile stretch of the heavily traveled Interstate 90 between Billings and the Wyoming border has reopened after more than a year of closure.
The rest stop, located between the town of Hardin and Billings, is the latest in a series of state construction projects looking to rehabilitate rest stops throughout the state. 
In Hardin, crews improved the experience of taking a break along the side of a highway. There’s more parking space — 30 truck stalls and 22 vehicle stalls at the Westbound site, and 28 truck and 21 vehicle spaces at the Eastbound site — and buildings are now more energy efficient and ADA accessible, too. MDT also added fenced off pet areas, ADA-accessible picnic areas with shelters, and new waters supply and wastewater treatment facilities.
“Rest areas are essential for highway safety, offering drivers a safe and convenient place to stop, which helps reduce the risk of fatigue-related crashes,” Mike Taylor, MDT Billings District Administrator said in a press release. “With increasing travel across the region, it is important that these facilities are designed to accommodate growing demand and ensure accessibility for all. We are proud to open this new facility.”
As part of the facility expansion, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks got an updated Watercraft Inspection Site, and an MDT Weigh Station was added.
“We are excited to complete this important restoration project,” Nolan Smith, a construction manager for Dick Anderson Construction said in a release. “Our team worked hard to ensure the upgraded facilities not only meet the needs of today’s travelers but will accommodate future visitors for years to come.”
In recent years, the state also completed projects at Quartz Creek and converted the Gold Creek rest area, both along I-90, near Garrison into a facility geared toward large truck parking. Three other facilities have been rebuilt by CDM Smith — I-90 rest areas near Columbus and Hysham as well as one along I-15 near Divide between 2015-18, costing a little more than $19 million in total. A new rest area was also built along I-90 near Three Forks, closing one nearer to Bozeman.
Much of the work stems back to complaints in the 1990s about rest stops throughout Montana. One of those was safety, and the Hardin project added additional lighting as well as video surveillance.
In 2009, major changes in the state’s rest area program were initiated when it received dedicated funding and a more formalized process for prioritization of projects. Five years later, the 2014 Rest Area Plan was finalized and remains the guidebook for those projects within the state. It was amended in 2019 to add data and projections, Charity Burns, a MDT spokesperson, wrote in an email. 
Two of the 69 rest stops in Montana remain closed, Bad Route near Glendive as well as the westbound Dena Mora (Lookout Pass) rest area on I-90. The Glendive rest area could be open by late fall, Burns added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HardinRestArea.png,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

Green International Airport is officially the best airport in the United States, Travel + Leisure, the New York-based travel magazine declared Tuesday.
T.F. Green received a score of 84.9 in the annual competition based on reader surveys evaluating airport accessibility, check-in and security processes, restaurants and bars, overall design, and shopping. Last year, the Warwick airport ranked second in the nation with a score of 82.31 — .01 points behind Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
The Twin Cities airport has now dropped to fourth place. In second place for 2025 is Portland International Airport in Oregon, which achieved a score of 82.44.
No other New England airports cracked the top 10 T.F. Green’s honor will appear in the August 2025 issue of Travel + Leisure, along with being featured online as part of the magazine’s annual World’s Best Awards. 
“To be named the No. 1 domestic airport by some of the most seasoned travelers in the world is both humbling and inspiring,” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, said in a statement. “We’re proud to be Rhode Island’s gateway to the world and the fastest growing airport in the country.”

Voters praised T.F. Green for its size and quick check-in time. Many readers said they travel farther in order to fly out of T.F. Green to avoid the more congested big city airports, according to Travel + Leisure.
In last year’s second-place ranking, the magazine took note of “an extraordinary number of comments about the bathrooms.” In 2023, the airport completed renovations in the men’s and women’s restrooms, which now have marble floors and fresh flowers in vases.
The best airport award adds another feather in T.F. Green’s cap as it works to stand out from competitors like Logan International Airport in Boston or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The Warwick airport will also remain the official hub of the New England Patriots for another three years.
Gov. Dan McKee called the honor not just an “incredible” designation for the airport, but the entire state of Rhode Island.
“The airport’s commitment to reliable, smooth, and convenient travel has paid off for countless passengers each year, getting them where they need to go when they need to be there,” McKee said in a statement. “I look forward to the new heights PVD is soaring towards, and what it brings to our economy, tourism, and business landscape.”

Registered nurse Amanda Manatt, 36, of Marshalltown, was recently charged by the Iowa Board of Nursing with misappropriating patient medications, falsifying records, committing an act that might adversely affect a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the nursing profession.
The board alleged that in December 2023, Manatt diverted an unspecified number of doses of controlled substances from a hospital’s supply and “took them for her own personal use.” In addition, she was accused of falsely documenting that the patients had actually received the drugs, which they had not.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Court records show that in 2024, Manatt was criminally charged with 10 felony counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances, one felony count of insurance fraud, and one misdemeanor count of tampering with records.
State prosecutors alleged that while working at UnityPoint Health-Marshalltown Hospital, Manatt repeatedly withdrew painkilling drugs such as morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone, claimed to have administered them to her patients, and then kept the drugs.
In one instance, a 22-month-old child identified as “E.M.” allegedly came to the Marshalltown Hospital emergency room in November 2023 after being attacked by a dog that prosecutors said “badly mauled” the child’s legs.
“E.M. was crying out in pain and Manatt was supposed to administer pain narcotics,” prosecutors alleged in charging documents. “Instead of administering the pain narcotics to E.M., Manatt diverted the pain narcotics and kept them for herself.”
Prosecutors also alleged that in December 2023, while Manatt was again working in the Marshalltown Hospital’s emergency room, a patient arrived with head and ankle injuries sustained during a fall down a flight of stairs. Manatt allegedly kept some of that patient’s fentanyl for her own use, according to prosecutors.
In March 2024, while Manatt was working at Mary Greeley Medical Center in Story County, prosecutors alleged, she stole hydromorphone intended for an emergency-room patient who was being treated for post-operative pain related to the fusion of spinal vertebrae.
In October 2024, all of the state charges against Manatt were dismissed with Assistant Marshall County Attorney Brianna Nelson informing the court that Manatt was then facing newly filed federal charges related to the same conduct.
Court records show the federal charges included eight counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit while working at the Marshalltown hospital, plus four counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit while working at the Story County hospital, and one count of one count of false statements related to health care matters.
In March 2025, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss 10 of the 13 charges in return for Manatt’s agreement to plead guilty to two counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit and one count of making false statements related to health care matters.
She is currently scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 14, 2025.
Other nursing board actions
In separate, unrelated disciplinary cases, two other Iowa nurses agreed recently to surrender their licenses:
— Registered Nurse Jennifer Kinson, 46, who was alleged to have stolen intravenous morphine from an unspecified patient or agency.  The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals, and Licensure investigated the allegation and concluded the allegation was founded, the board alleges.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Kinson agreed not to contest the charges and agreed to surrender her license.
The board has not disclosed where Kinson lives, where the alleged theft took place, when it occurred, the manner in which the drugs were taken, or whether any patients were harmed.
However, court records show that in May 2023, Kinson was criminally charged with prohibited acts involving controlled substances and tampering with records. She was accused of diverting medications from at least 10 patients at an Iowa Select Specialty Hospital campus in Wright County.
In November 2023, county prosecutors agreed to a deferred prosecution that resulted in the criminal charges being dismissed due to Kinson pleading guilty to other charges in another county.
The other charges appear tied to a February 2024 case in which police met with administrators at Veterans Memorial Hospital in Waukon to review video evidence that suggested Kinson, a former nurse at the hospital, had stolen morphine from patients. Kinson was then charged with illegal possession of a controlled substance. She later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor fifth-degree theft and was fined $105.
— Licensed Practical Nurse Julie Porter, who was first licensed in 1989. Board records show that in 1993, while living in Waverly and known as Julie Wefel, Porter was charged by the board with willful or repeated departure from the minimum standards of nursing.
The board alleged she was employed at a long-term care facility from 1991 through 1992, when she failed to respond to reports from two certified nursing assistants that a patient was experiencing chest pain. The patient died during that shift, the board alleged, and Porter was fired a week later.
The board also stated in December 1991 and February 1992, Porter received five separate five-day suspensions at work for excessive absenteeism, falsely documenting treatments which had not actually been completed, and not reporting for work as scheduled.
As a result of the allegations, Porter’s license was placed on probation for two years.
Recently, the board charged Porter with failing to assess or evaluate the status of a patient and with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient. The board alleged that in August 2023, after working an overnight shift at an unspecified facility, Porter falsely documented completing a patient assessment.
“When confronted with video footage showing she was at the nurses’ station at the time she reported performing the assessment, (Porter) admitted she did not perform the reported assessment,” the board alleges.
The available board documents give no indication as to the patient outcome in the 2023 case.,
Porter recently agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.

The township paid for the concert with national opioid settlement funds. (Photo courtesy of Irvington Township)Irvington officials took $632,000 in funds meant to help people struggling with addiction and spent it instead on two “opioid awareness” concerts, steering the bulk of the money to a township employee who’s a DJ, a state watchdog said in a new report released Tuesday.
The township blew more than $14,000 on popcorn, cotton candy carts, shaved ice, and other food, almost $13,000 on luxury VIP trailers for performers, and more than $205,000 to promote the summer concerts, which were held in 2023 and 2024, investigators from the state comptroller’s office found.
“These funds are supposed to be lifelines for communities overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic — not a slush fund to host concerts and throw parties,” acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh said in a statement. “Irvington wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars that should have been used to save lives and help people recover from addiction.”
Irvington Mayor Tony Vauss denied the report’s findings, released a 36-page response, and vowed to proceed with a defamation lawsuit officials filed against Walsh’s office in April.
“We’ve been definitely going back and forth with the comptroller’s office over these issues for a while now, and we actually had to file a lawsuit because we totally, totally disagree with what they’re saying,” Vauss told the New Jersey Monitor. “I mean, there’s no basis in law. They’re coming up with theories. We’re just like, how are you coming to these conclusions?”
The $632,000 was part of more than $1 million Irvington has received in national opioid settlement funds, which pharmaceutical companies are paying to atone for their role in the deadly opioid crisis.
Towns and counties across New Jersey, as well as the state itself, are expected to receive more than $1.1 billion by 2038 and began receiving the funds in 2022. But a state council tasked with advising public officials on the best use of the funds didn’t issue guidance until last month.
That’s one reason why Walsh’s scrutiny isn’t fair, said attorney Christopher Kinum, who represents Irvington.
“Every municipality is using the funds for a different reason. These funds were disbursed before there was guidance. All there was, was some term — ‘evidence-based.’ ‘Proven evidence-based methods to combat the opioid crisis,’” Kinum said.
Irvington officials have been fighting the comptroller’s probe for months, asking courts to block the office from releasing its findings. Lower courts initially sided with Irvington, forbidding the office from releasing its report and even extending that injunction to Gov. Phil Murphy, Senate President Nicholas Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who received early copies for review. 
But an appellate judge last month ordered the injunction lifted, saying Irvington had a chance to respond to a draft report and the issue was moot anyway because the report was already partially released. He stayed the report’s release until the state Supreme Court decided whether to hear Irvington’s appeal.
That court on Tuesday declined to hear the case, clearing the way for Walsh to release his report — which his office did, within minutes.
The report is blistering, blasting township officials for deciding to hold the concerts with no input from community groups, residents on the frontlines of the opioid crisis, or even the township’s own health and public safety officials.

Entertainment companies tied to Antoine “DJ Qua” Richardson, a township employee, received $368,500 to secure performers, with officials failing to seek competitive bids in violation of procurement law, investigators said. Officials spent no money on Narcan, although they said they did distribute doses of the overdose-reversing drug at both concerts. Most concert materials promoted the performers, the mayor, and the concerts, rather than educating residents about addiction or offering information about treatment, according to the report.
Officials failed to track metrics to evaluate the concerts’ success, as required by the settlement agreements, and yet proceeded with a second concert anyway against the advice of the comptroller’s office, the report says.
Walsh’s office made 28 recommendations, including urging the state Department of Human Services to bolster oversight and issue detailed guidance to local public officials on acceptable use of opioid settlement funds. The office also referred their findings to various agencies for further action.
“Local governments are asking for direction, and DHS is the agency with that expertise,” Walsh said. “A passive approach by state government risks setting local governments up to fail and may invite more waste.”
Irvington did not hold an opioid awareness concert this year, but Kinum said the concerts are not off the table in the future. The township still has close to a half million dollars in unspent opioid settlement funds.
“We are exploring it,” Kinum said. “This is an evidence-based proper use of funds. We’ll take a look at it, and we potentially want to bounce ideas off that board (the state advisory council).”
Kinum cited an April letter a Rutgers Health manager sent Irvington expressing support for their concerts and the concerts’ role in emphasizing “cultural competence and community engagement.”
But opioid-awareness concerts are not something the New Jersey Harm Reduction Council recommends.
Jenna Mellor heads that council and also sits on the state advisory council that issued June’s guidance.

That guidance was shaped by 15 months of data research and input from experts and residents who have firsthand experience with addiction, Mellor noted. The council’s five-year strategic plan prioritizes expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, harm reduction supplies and services, and wraparound supports, including affordable housing and legal aid.
“Public education is good. Reducing stigma is good. No one is disputing that. But it’s not what turns the tide on any of this,” Mellor told the New Jersey Monitor.
“These are precious dollars,” she added. “We are facing federal budget cuts. We are always in a struggle to have a state budget every year that meets the basic needs of residents. Our recommendations are really what is smart use of this money, because they immediately, in real time, save people’s lives.”
Mellor and other members of the state advisory council were fighting their own battle Tuesday.
They sent an open letter to Murphy and legislative leaders, calling on lawmakers to return $45 million they diverted in opioid settlement funds (the money is going to four hospitals to offset federal Medicaid cuts). At least two of the hospitals are led by Murphy allies.
Harm reduction advocates protested and held a die-in in the Statehouse in Trenton last week, in an effort to persuade legislators to reject the diversion. Lawmakers approved the budget anyway.
In Tuesday’s letter, six members of the 11-member council urged lawmakers to “reverse the raid of opioid settlement funds” and establish “lockbox protections” around how the funds can be used.
“We are deeply alarmed by this decision and what it means for the future of New Jersey’s overdose prevention efforts,” they wrote. “Raiding the opioid settlement fund completely undermines the role of our Council, which exists to ensure these funds are used for overdose prevention initiatives that are effective, evidence-based, and rooted in community need.”
Elected officials should consider their legacy and their accountability to their constituents in deciding whether to heed the council’s call to reverse the cuts, Mellor added.
“My dad says it’s OK to be wrong, but don’t be wrong long,” Mellor said. “There’s part of leadership that requires finding solutions and not accepting the status quo. If our lawmakers wanted to fix this, they can. I’m hopeful that they will do the right thing.”

Residents in King, Spokane and Clark counties can now report hate crimes and bias incidents to the non-emergency hotline at 1-855-225-1010 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. This pilot will last 18 months, before Washington expands the hotline statewide in January 2027.
Staff can help callers find support services or assist in reporting incidents to local police. Anyone in the three counties can also report online. If experiencing an active emergency, residents should call 911, not the new hotline.
“Hate crimes not only directly harm individuals but also can instill harm throughout the community,” state Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. 
The Legislature created the hotline last year, with mostly Democratic support. 
Oregon established a similar hotline in 2020, and has seen reports steadily rising since then, from about 1,100 in 2020 to more than 5,800 last year. But spam and harassment calls are driving much of that increase, a new report found this month. At the same time, reported incidents declined slightly last year, which officials attributed to waning confidence in the program.
Oregon’s attorney general called the developments a “a sobering gut check and a call to action.”
California’s hotline, implemented in 2023, saw about 1,000 hateful acts reported in the first year.
Most years, Washington sees 500 to 600 hate crime incidents reported to police, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. This places Washington consistently in the top five states with the most reports. Hate crimes can be based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability, among other protected classes.
For decades, the state’s hate crime statute called such actions “malicious harassment.” But in 2019, amid the rise in these crimes, lawmakers changed the term to the more commonly used “hate crime offense.”
“We took an important step in 2019 by changing our hate crime laws — but the rise in hate and bias incidents shows there’s still more to do,” said Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, who sponsored last year’s bill creating the hotline. “That’s why this hotline matters. It’s not just about policy — it’s about people. It’s about making sure every victim is heard and supported.”
Since 2019, legislators have made more changes to the hate crime statute, such as specifying the charge as a “crime against persons,” which makes perpetrators subject to supervised release after finishing their sentence. They also removed the requirement for “physical injury” to meet the hate crime threshold. And they took out from the law the term “swastika” in recognition of religious communities that use the symbol Nazis appropriated.
Lawmakers also added property damage as a possible basis for a hate crime.
And later this month, another law, passed this year, will take effect to clarify that bias need not be the only motivation to commit a hate crime. 
Unlike hate crimes, “bias incidents” don’t rise to the level of a crime. Examples of such conduct include insulting language based on someone’s gender, mocking someone with a disability or creating racist drawings.
“When immigrant families in my network face verbal harassment that makes them afraid to send their children to school,” Catalina Velasquez, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said in a statement. “When transgender people of color experience daily microaggressions that chip away at their humanity, when our elders are told to ‘go back where they came from’ — these are acts of violence that shape our material conditions and our ability to exist safely in the world.”
Washington’s state Republican Party called the new hotline a “snitch line” that would be “weaponized against those with viewpoint diversity.”
Beginning in July 2027, the attorney general’s office will publish annual reports on calls the hotline receives.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/person-with-cellphone-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

These include proposals to establish a climate superfund, repeal the state’s 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases that is currently tied up in court and establish a comprehensive data privacy law. 
Legislation that would prohibit local police from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities will also be picked back up next year, as well as an omnibus tribal sovereignty bill. 
On the final day before lawmakers adjourned this year, legislators passed a joint order listing the proposals that will be revisited when the Legislature reconvenes in January. They will resume work on the bills based on where they left off when the session adjourned last month. 
While some of the bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. The 193 carry over bills compiled by Maine Morning Star don’t include those that were left on the special appropriations and study tables, which will also be carried over, as well as any bills otherwise left in the possession of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee. 
Though there were no formal limitations as to the types of bills that could be introduced in the first regular session, the second session is limited to budgetary matters, legislation from the governor, as well as proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.
Often, committees will carry over legislation from the first session as a way to act on legislation that couldn’t be introduced in the second session. Lawmakers may also determine that a proposal needs more time to be workshopped or may depend on external factors with longer timelines than the first session allows, such as a court case.

Ned Lamont and New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, both exploring runs in 2026, agreed they have similar ideas on local control over zoning.","The mood was congenial as politicians joked and laughed at a Tuesday celebration of the opening of a 154-unit affordable housing complex in New Britain.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat weighing a run for a third term, joked about the ease of building housing in Houston, which doesn’t have zoning. He spoke alongside Republican New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who has created an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial campaign, at the ribbon cutting of the building, which was funded through nearly $8 million in state grants.
Their easy banter and public comments Tuesday gave a potential preview of one issue that is unlikely to be a topic of heated debate between the two should they find themselves going up against one another in a 2026 gubernatorial race — housing policy.
Both politicians, who easily won the New Britain vote in their last elections, agreed their ideas on housing are similar, with a focus on local control.
“This is great for my neighborhood,” Stewart said, gesturing at the former homewares manufacturing factory behind her, which is now home mostly to families earning between $30,000 and $80,000 annually. “This is not good for a bedroom community that is home to two-acre properties and white picket fences. I think that’s what the argument is all about. When it comes to policy, you don’t want to take away local control from the people that live in those communities.” 
Lamont has long adopted a more moderate stance on housing policy and spoken in favor of local control. He said he and Stewart have similar ideas on the issue.
“When it comes to transit-oriented we’ve been here,” Lamont said, of New Britain. “You have the FasTrak. We’ve done a lot of housing together along that [route].”
During Stewart’s tenure, New Britain has focused on building more housing and shops near its bus stations.
Lamont last month caused a political stir when he vetoed Democratic lawmakers’ housing omnibus bill, House Bill 5002. The sweeping measure would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units, removed some off-street parking mandates for smaller housing developments and prioritized state funding for towns that develop more housing near public transit, among other things.
Although the governor’s staff had negotiated the bill and previously indicated he would sign it, after pushback from local groups, Lamont sided with Republicans and vetoed the bill. 
After the veto, another potential Republican opponent, Westport First Selectwoman Jen Tooker, who has already announced her candidacy for governor, said in a statement that Lamont’s veto was “a victory, for sure,” and criticized the proposal for diluting local control. 
Lamont’s office is now in negotiations with lawmakers and plans to call a special session to vote on a reworked bill.
Stewart said she was among the local officials who reached out to Lamont to ask him to veto the bill.
“You have a lot of legislators who come up with great ideas for what may work for them in their communities, but it just doesn’t work in other communities across the state,” Stewart said. “And you know, Connecticut, we’re 169 different fiefdoms, and we have to be respectful of that.”
She said housing policy should be focused on giving communities the tools and training they need to develop what they want to see.
Lamont said his staff is working to “clean up,” and “clarify,” a few details of the housing bill, but declined to offer details. He added he’d like to have a special session later this month.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4799-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Over the weekend, Deputy House Democratic Leader Laura Telerski published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader in which she castigated House Majority Leader Jason Osborne for his “out of touch” budget statements on the House floor late last month. 
“He stood up and said that people at the barbershop or the grocery store aren’t asking about Medicaid reimbursement rates,” she wrote. “It was an elitist dismissal.”
She went on to argue that “the reality is that working people do think about the ways this budget harms them.”
I was watching, too, on June 26 when Osborne delivered that facepalm closing argument, and Telerski’s criticism is legitimate. But that’s not even the most frustrating thing about Osborne’s speech. He was essentially claiming that the purpose of public service is to give the people what they want, for themselves, while keeping them in the dark about broader, more consequential matters that affect the whole — directly or indirectly, now or later. For that reason, his barbershop stand wasn’t the “man of the people” flex he intended it to be. Instead, it was a confession of compromised legislative stewardship and, worse, a purposeful abdication of responsibility to all the people of the state — including those very barbershop and grocery store patrons.
As a top Republican leader in the State House, Osborne should understand better than most how much Medicaid — reimbursement rates included — does matter to the function of the state’s entire care system. He should also understand that it’s his job as a lawmaker and party leader to report back to his constituents about the direct and indirect price that will be paid for the cuts he supports — and in their name.
But here’s what he said on the House floor: “When I go to the barbershop … or the grocery store, or anywhere else in the state, they’re not asking me about all of the things that are in (House Bill 2) like, you know, elevator weights and measures and Medicaid reimbursement rates and all of these things that the folks in finance (here, Osborne is interrupted by a small Democratic uproar in the chamber, prompting a sharp general reprimand from House Speaker Sherman Packard) … The one thing they ask me about is, ‘When are you going to repeal those car inspections?’ And that’s what we are doing today.”
Huh.
Osborne didn’t intend it as such, but that’s a good example of what happens when governance by self interest overrides governance for the public good. Systems designed to benefit the whole are often complex and budget policy is what allows those systems to function — or not. That complexity is the main reason we elect people to serve in legislative bodies to make decisions on our behalf and at our behest. Maybe direct democracy could work for something like repealing car inspections, where a benefit can be weighed with relative ease against the potential consequences. But to take anecdotal public disinterest in something as broadly consequential as Medicaid reimbursement rates — or the program as a whole — as some sort of a mandate for applied ignorance is broken government in action. It is, in true modern Republican fashion, callousness rebranded as political bravery.
As a rolling result of that brand of legislative aloofness, you’re likely to hear one question again and again from the voting public as the ripples of federal and state budget cuts inevitably spread outward and undermine crucial care and support systems: How could this happen? 
Republicans will most likely answer by continuing to blame phantom “waste, fraud, and abuse” or immigrants or the LGBTQ+ community or previous administrations or the amorphous boogeyman known as “The Libs.” But the real answers aren’t hard to find. Follow the money, follow the policies that directed, redirected, or eliminated that money — the tax cuts, the budget cuts, the universal school vouchers — and then follow those policies to the politicians who championed them. 
If their defense amid all of the crumbling still amounts to something like “Medicaid reimbursement rates are boring,” we’ve clearly set the bar too low for public service.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osborne-press-conference-1024x758.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo by Jim Argo/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY – State park restaurants have been closed following a contract dispute with the vendor, officials announced Tuesday.
Officials with the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation said they made the decision to close The Lookout Kitchen restaurants because the vendor owes the state $254,943, hasn’t supplied required records and still must provide a $500,000 surety bond or letter of credit, according to a letter made public by the agency.
“Please note that until such time that your client has taken care of the gross receipt remittances and reporting listed above, OTRD is unable to execute or negotiate any change in the monthly payment amount,” the letter said.
Brian Buswell, an attorney for RPW ENT LLC, which operates The Lookout Kitchen, said they were “currently negotiating with the state” on those issues. He said couldn’t comment further.
The company had operated restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose, Quartz Mountain and Sequoyah state parks.
State officials said the restaurants will be closed until further notice.
Sterling Zearley, the agency’s executive director, on Tuesday declined a request for an interview.
The agency said in a statement that it was working to minimize disruptions to park operations and provide alternative food options, such as grab and go sandwiches, snacks and drinks. It was also looking into the use of food trucks, the agency said.
In 2022, the agency canceled its contract with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen.
The company had been hired to redesign, rebuild and revitalize the six restaurants
In 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted three people, including Swadley’s founder Ronald Brent Swadley, in connection with the controversial state contract to operate park restaurants. They were charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state. 
The three have pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has been set for Nov. 3, according to court records.
The Lookout Kitchen was awarded the state park restaurant contracts following the dispute with Swadley’s.

The Appalachian Regional Commission is an economic partnership between the federal government and 13 state governments, including Kentucky, in a region of the U.S. that has been historically impoverished. Congress created the commission in 1965.

The letter says that Appalachia “has built incredible momentum towards a multi-industry economy that provides good jobs that take good care of the communities around us” in recent years and credits the commission with “driving forward this potential.” 
“Reductions to its programs pose a risk to innovative initiatives in workforce development, community revitalization, and American-made resilient energy,” the letter says. The letter was sent to the chairs, vice chair and ranking member of House and Senate appropriations committees.
With Trump and the GOP’s megabill signed into law, Congress is poised to begin focusing on appropriations for the next fiscal year and responding to the president’s discretionary budget funding proposal. 
In a press release about the letter, Jeffery Justice, of Letcher County, said the commission “has been and continues to be a driving force in the Appalachian Renaissance.” Justice is the president and executive director of the Pine Mountain Partnership, an economic development initiative in Eastern Kentucky. 
“We must maintain momentum in order to build a more diverse, sustainable economy,” Justice said. 
Ruthie Caldwell, a grant writer in Eastern Kentucky, said the commission has “helped young people learn skilled trades so they don’t have to leave home to find a good-paying job” and “brought in tourists who shop at our local businesses — and even some folks who end up investing in new ones.” Caldwell is the owner of Vision Granted based in Floyd County. 
“I’ve worked with recovery programs where people are turning their lives around — getting jobs, rebuilding families, and finding hope right here in their hometowns,” Caldwell said. “The ARC is one of the few federal programs that truly understands our region and meets us where we are. It helps us build a better future from the ground up. Cutting this funding now would undo so much of the progress our communities have worked so hard for. I hope Congress will continue to invest in Appalachia — we’re worth it, and the work is far from done.”

,DC,2025-07-08 21:10:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,USDA chief outlines plan to block China from U.S. farmland ownership,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/usda-chief-outlines-plan-block-china-us-farmland-ownership,,"President Donald Trump’s administration will pursue a ban on Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland as part of an effort to strengthen farm security, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Tuesday.Appearing alongside other Cabinet officials, Republican governors and members of Congress at an event outside the U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters in Washington, D.C., Rollins announced a department initiative to block “foreign countries of concern” from owning U.S. agriculture lands.Rollins said officials will even try to revoke lands already owned by China-backed entities.The administration will “take swift legislative and executive action to ban the purchase of American farmland by Chinese nationals and other foreign adversaries,” she said.The executive branch will also work with state and local officials “to do everything within our ability, including presidential authorities, to claw back what has already been purchased by China and other foreign adversaries.”Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the nation’s food supply was a national security issue on par with energy and water supplies.Plan detailsThe seven-part initiative, titled the National Farm Security Action Plan, is based on the idea that “farm security is national security,” according to a preamble to USDA’s written plan.U.S. farmers dominate the global industry, the preamble said.“Because that dominance is earned and not assured, it is critical we continuously adapt our approach to American agriculture security and elevate it to the top echelon of national security priorities,” the document read.To protect U.S. farmland, the USDA, with help from the Justice Department, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and cooperative state and local governments, will seek to block investment by foreign adversaries and launch an online tool to help farmers report on potential unknown foreign ownership.The administration will look for vulnerabilities in the agricultural supply chain and attempt to ensure crop and nutrition programs are not being used to fund terrorist or criminal activity, while cutting down on fraud and abuse. The plan instructs the administration to strengthen biosecurity measures.The initiative also calls for making sure foreign governments cannot access USDA research grants or other department funding programs.The USDA will continue to work with the national security establishment and law enforcement to protect the agriculture sector’s critical infrastructure, according to the plan.After Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Roger Marshall of Kansas at the event criticized the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an executive branch agency, for not having a spot for the Agriculture secretary, Rollins said she would be joining the panel as of Tuesday afternoon.Farmland securityAt the Tuesday event, speakers offered few specifics about the initiative but praised the administration for elevating the issue of foreign investment in farmland.“A country has to be able to feed itself, fuel itself, and fight for itself to truly be free,” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “We now have a president who understands it and is willing to do everything within his power to make sure the United States continues to be the greatest country on the face of the planet.”“Our farmland is not just dirt, it is our national security, it is our economic future, it is our children’s heritage,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said. “And it is under threat, and the leaders here recognize that.”Speakers emphasized what they called the threat of Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland.“Today, we tell China to get the hell out of American agriculture,” Marshall said.Nebraska Gov. James Pillen said his state had moved to ban Chinese equipment from telecommunications infrastructure and has worked to deny Chinese companies from owning farmland. He related a story of stonewalling Chinese-owned Syngenta, which sought a meeting with the governor.“I said, ‘I have no interest in having a meeting,’” he said. “‘Have no interest in you being in Nebraska. My suggestion would be to leave. My suggestion would be to get a different job.’”The company later sold their assets in Nebraska, Pillen said.Alabama and ChinaTuberville, who is running in the state’s gubernatorial race next year, appeared to say China owned 2.2 million acres of farmland in his state alone – a number that actually describes the acres of land owned by all foreign entities in the state. Chinese entities own no acres in Alabama, according to USDA data.“China is a threat,” he said. “They're not a threat. They are dominating us in almost everything that they do because we've sat back and the politicians have been counting their money instead of doing what's right and helping this country stay in the front. We've got to be number one. We can't be number two. We've got to fight back.“They are coming into our country and buying our farmland. In my state of Alabama alone, they own 2.2 million acres of farmland. That's right in Alabama. Foreign adversaries.”Asked about the comment, Tuberville spokesperson Mallory Jaspers said he was referring not only to Chinese ownership but all foreign adversaries and indicated that he opposed any foreign ownership of U.S. farmland.“Sen. Tuberville believes American farmland should be owned by Americans,” she wrote in an email.The most recent year-end USDA report on foreign investment, in 2023, showed Chinese-linked investors held about 276,000 acres of U.S. farmland nationwide.An analysis from the American Farm Bureau, an advocacy group, estimated Chinese investors accounted for only about .02% of all foreign owned U.S. agricultural land.GOP governors back planIn addition to Lee, Huckabee Sanders and Pillen, who spoke outside of USDA, the Republican governors of Indiana, Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota and Oklahoma signed a Tuesday letter to Rollins in support of the plan.“As America First Governors, we firmly stand together in our unwavering support of President Donald J. Trump and his administration’s National Farm Security Action Plan,” they wrote. “This plan is a critical and decisive response to the invasion of our land, food system, and sovereignty by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).”",,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

The Republican from Jackson made the long-expected campaign announcement Tuesday with a video featuring clips of him speaking to constituents and sharing a stage with President Donald Trump as well as footage of his football career at the University of Georgia.
Jones was elected lieutenant governor in 2022, and before that he served in the state Senate for a decade.
“Today, I see a Georgia where families are prospering,” Jones says in the announcement. “A Georgia where businesses are moving here and growing here. A Georgia where our families are safer thanks to tougher crime laws. And our schools strengthen thanks to empowering parents’ rights.”
“What do I call all that we’ve accomplished together? Just a start,” he adds. “Because our work’s not done yet, and that’s why I’m running for governor.”
Jones pledged that if he is elected, he will work to eliminate the state income tax, reduce fentanyl deaths and continue to prevent transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams.
The Republican field

But before he has a chance to kick his feet up in the governor’s mansion, Jones will have to win the GOP primary, where his only major challenge so far is Attorney General Chris Carr, who entered the race early back in November and has sopped up plenty of donor dollars since then.
Carr announced Monday that he had raised $1.25 million between February and the end of June for a total of nearly $3.5 million since joining the race.
“This campaign has always been about Georgia, and these numbers show just how motivated folks are to keep Georgia strong,” Carr said in a statement Monday. “That kind of energy can’t be bought — it’s earned, and we’re ready to deliver.”
Because Jones entered the race after the end of the filing deadline in June, he has not filed a financial disclosure report.
Carr, who was appointed by then-Gov. Nathan Deal as the state’s top lawyer in 2016 and elected twice since then, has campaigned as a tough-on-crime conservative.
Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone indicated there will be a spirited debate between the two candidates.
“Chris Carr is a smart, principled conservative with a proven record of leadership – and the discipline to get things done,” Mazzone said. “He’s spent his career serving the people of Georgia, not himself. We look forward to a campaign that will offer a clear contrast between a record of results and a record of self-interest.”
But with official qualifying not set to begin until spring, there’s still plenty of time for other Republican heavyweights to enter the race.
That could include Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Rome Republican who is arguably more aligned with Trump than either candidate already in the race. That could be a boon in the GOP primary but potentially a hindrance in a general election where a candidate would need more moderate support.
Greene told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last month that she was weighing whether to step down from Congress for a run at the governorship.
“It’s definitely something that I think is smart for me to consider, but it’s not a decision I take lightly,” she said. “I absolutely love my district. I cannot say that enough times. I think Georgia’s 14th District is wonderful. and I have a very powerful position in Congress. But I love my state. I really do.”
If Greene’s flaw is that she has more appeal with the base than the general electorate, another potential GOP candidate could have the opposite problem.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is seen as a potential candidate for governor, even though delegates at the state GOP convention last month passed a resolution seeking to bar him from qualifying for the ballot as a Republican.
Raffensperger’s refusal to cooperate with Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia earned him respect from some liberals and moderates but made him persona non grata with elements of the conservative base.
The Dems
Whoever walks away with the GOP nomination will face a Democrat hungry for a win after nibbling around the edges in recent election cycles.
  Sen. Jason Esteves. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In 2018, candidates for governor in Georgia competed for an open seat after Deal was term-limited from running again. At the time, a Republican president named Donald Trump was implementing policies that were more popular with the Republican base than swing voters.
That year, Stacey Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to now-Gov. Brian Kemp.
Since then, Democrats’ hopes have been buoyed with statewide wins from Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and former President Joe Biden in 2020. Warnock also eked out a reelection victory in 2022.
Party leaders are seeing similarities to 2018 and hoping that continued demographic changes, get-out-the-vote infrastructure and frustration with federal Republicans will be enough to push Democrats over the top and reclaim the governor’s mansion for the first time in two decades.
So far, two frontrunners are aiming to be the one to lead that charge.

State Sen. Jason Esteves and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms have both claimed major fundraising hauls since entering the race earlier this year.
Each claimed war chests of $1.1 million during the period between February and June. Bottoms’ haul includes a $200,000 personal loan to her campaign, while Esteves donated the maximum amount of $8,400 to his campaign but did not loan his campaign money.
In a statement following Jones’ Tuesday announcement, Esteves sought to tie the Republican hopefuls to the White House.
“We can’t afford a governor who cares more about cheerleading for Donald Trump than making life better for Georgians,” Esteves said. “Whether it’s Burt Jones or Chris Carr, the truth is they’re both running on out-of-touch agendas that will raise costs, leave millions of Georgians uninsured, and abandon working families. As the GOP primary becomes a race to the extreme, I’m focused on what really matters: making life more affordable, expanding health care access, and investing in Georgia.”
State Rep. Derrick Jackson, a Tyrone Democrat running for governor, reported raising just over $88,000 since February, including a $77,000 loan from himself.
The Democratic field still has time to coalesce as well, and more could join the field of candidates.
Abrams was reportedly considering a run as recently as April, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She comes with the advantage of being a national star and the Democrat to come the closest to winning a gubernatorial election in recent history but also the baggage of two recent losses – including a nearly 8-point loss in 2022.
But the darkest of dark horses might come in the form of former Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose messy divorce from the GOP began after Trump’s refusal to concede in 2020 and was finalized in January when the party banished him for supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president.
In an episode of the AJC’s “Politically Georgia” podcast released July 1, Duncan said he’d be open to running for statewide office as a Democrat.
“If given the opportunity to be taken seriously by the Democrats and have an opportunity to shift the platform, I’d certainly think about it.”

Gilchrist is seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor, which will be decided by voters in next year’s August gubernatorial primary election, while Byrum is seeking the position of secretary of state. Democratic Party delegates will decide who gets that nomination during its 2026 nominating convention.
Announcing their support for Gilchrist on Tuesday were Democratic state Sens. Veronica Klinfelt of Eastpointe and Paul Wojno of Warren, and nine members of the Michigan House of Representatives.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Democrats on that list include state Reps. Brenda Cater of Pontiac, Kimberly Edwards of Eastpointe, Morgan Foreman of Pittsfield Township, Peter Herzberg of Westland, Donavan McKinney of Detroit, Cynthia Neeley of Flint, Amos O’Neal of Saginaw, Laurie Pohutsky of Livonia and Mai Xiong of Warren.
Support from Edwards, Klinefelt, Wojno and Xiong could be crucial for Gilchrist in Macomb County, who would face current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in August 2026 if all three candidates are able to make the ballot. Neeley’s support of Gilchrist is also striking as both she and Swanson serve Genesee County.
Republicans including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are seeking their party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Meanwhile, Byrum on Tuesday also announced that several sitting and former Democratic legislators were throwing their support behind her secretary of state bid.
That list includes state Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, Pohutsky and other state representatives, like Kara Hope of Holt, Will Snyder of Muskegon and Penelope Tsernoglou of East Lansing.
“Barb Byrum has dedicated her career to ensuring her constituents have free, fair, and transparent elections, and I know she will fight tirelessly to protect those rights for all Michiganders,” Pohutsky said in a statement.
In a statement, Irwin said Michigan, now more than ever, needs a secretary of state with a solid foundation in legislative experience and the ability to work with lawmakers to make strides forward. Byrum served three terms in the House prior to being elected as Ingham’s clerk.
“As a former colleague, I saw Barb Byrum stand strong for our values when under attack from Republicans, and I also saw her ability to work across the aisle when appropriate,” Irwin said.
Also announcing their support for Byrum on Tuesday was her mother and former Michigan State University Trustee Dianne Byrum, as well as:
​​Former House Democratic Floor Leader Kathy Angerer of Dundee;

Former State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-Lansing);
Former State Rep. Pam Byrnes (D-Chelsea);
Former State Rep. George Cushingberry (D-Detroit);
Former State Rep. Marie Donigan (D-Royal Oak);
Former State Rep. Brian Elder (D-Bay City);
Former State Rep. Steve Lindberg (D-Marquette);
Former State Rep. Gary McDowell (D-Rudyard);
Former State Rep. Joel Sheltrown (D-West Branch); and
Former State Rep. Mary Valentine (D-Norton Shores).

Byrum currently faces incumbent Deputy Secretary of State Aghogo Edevbie in the race for the Michigan Democratic Party nomination. No Republican candidate has yet to declare a bid for the party’s nomination.
Rogers nets police officer support, El-Sayed has $1.8M over 3 months in respective U.S. Senate bids
On the U.S. senate front, in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), Republican candidate and former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) announced Tuesday that he has the support of the Police Officers Association of Michigan.

The association known as POAM said in a release shared by Rogers’ campaign that the candidate will work toward a shared mission of keeping Michiganders safe.

“No candidate is a better friend to law enforcement or more committed to keeping Michigan families safe than Mike Rogers,” POAM President James Tignanelli in a statement. “He has dedicated his life to service and understands the sacrifice. Mike will also be a fierce ally in our mission to make Michigan’s streets safer every day. The Police Officers Association of Michigan is all in for Mike Rogers.”

Rogers thanked POAM for its support.

“From keeping deadly drugs out of our communities, to protecting victims, and locking up the bad guys, I will fight alongside our brave law enforcement to make each day safer than the last. I’m grateful for the Police Officers Association of Michigan’s full support.”
Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed said Tuesday that he has raised $1.8 million over three months in his campaign to replace Peters.
On social media, El-Sayed said 95% of the donations were under $100 each.
“After traveling 8,000+ miles across Michigan, downing 592 espresso shots and eating 15 whitefish along the way, this movement is just getting started,” El-Sayed wrote on X.

El-Sayed will face state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and former state House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) in next year’s Democratic primary.
Rogers currently has little competition on the Republican side, with Kent Benham, a dentist, and Fred Heurtebise, a welder, as the only other candidates. Republican U.S. Rep.

(Getty Images)Gov. Tony Evers along with advocates for the environment and for LGBTQ people as well as Democratic Party lawmakers hailed Tuesday’s state Supreme Court ruling that strips a Wisconsin legislative committee’s power to block state regulations.
Republican leaders in the Legislature — who’ve deployed that power successfully against the Evers administration for the last six years — condemned the Court’s action as consolidating power in the executive branch.
Tuesday’s ruling, written by Chief Justice Jill Karofsky for the Court’s four-member liberal majority, found that state laws giving the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) the power to block state regulations were unconstitutional.
The ruling said that in doing so, the committee was rewriting state laws that affected the rights and duties authorized for executive branch officials.
JCRAR has repeatedly thwarted Evers administration rules since the governor first took office in 2019. Tuesday’s ruling was the result of a lawsuit Evers filed in 2023 challenging the committee’s actions in suspending a rule that bans conversion therapy and indefinitely blocking an update to the state building code.
“The people of Wisconsin expect state government to work — and work better — for them,” Evers said in a statement Tuesday applauding the ruling.
“For years, a small group of Republican lawmakers overstepped their power, holding rules hostage without explanation or action and causing gridlock across state government,” Evers said.
“Today’s Wisconsin Supreme Court decision ensures that no small group of lawmakers has the sole power to stymie the work of state government and go unchecked,” the governor said. “This is an incredibly important decision that will ensure state government can do our important work efficiently and effectively to serve Wisconsinites across our state.”
Conversion therapy ban maintained
The ruling ensured that a rule will continue barring therapists treating LGBTQ people from using conversion therapy to try to change sexual orientation or gender identity.
JCRAR suspended the rule in early 2023 after it was last promulgated. The professional board that had enacted the rule reinstated it in April 2024 after the Legislature concluded its 2023-24 session. Tuesday’s ruling will prevent JCRAR from blocking the rule again.
“The continuous suspensions of the rule represented legislative overreach in the rule-making process and threatened the ability of professions in Wisconsin to create their standards,” said the National Association of Social Workers Wisconsin Chapter (NASW-Wisconsin) in a statement welcoming the Court’s ruling.
The association has sought the conversion therapy ban since 2018.
“After seven and a half years of trying to ban the harmful, discredited and unethical practice of conversion therapy and having the rule repeatedly blocked by the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules, I am thrilled by this ruling,” said Marc Herstand, the social worker association’s executive director. “Professions have the right to establish their own conduct code, and no social worker should ever engage in the practice of conversion therapy.”
Republicans attack ruling
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater), chair of the committee, criticized the Court’s ruling.
“Today the liberal majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ended nearly 7 decades of shared governance between the legislature and executive branch agencies aimed at protecting the rights of individuals, families and businesses from the excessive actions of bureaucrats,” Nass said in a statement.
“The liberal junta on the state supreme court has in essence given Evers the powers of a King,” he said.
Nass also attacked Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, charging that in the budget that lawmakers passed on the evening of July 2 and Evers signed shortly after midnight, Vos “gave away the power-of-the-purse-string for the next two years, so our options of defunding bureaucrats are now off the table.”
Vos also released a statement attacking the ruling.
“For decades, case law has upheld the constitutionality of the legislative rules committee to serve as a legitimate check on the powers of the Governor and the overreach of the bureaucracy,” Vos said. “The absence of oversight from elected representatives grows government and allows unelected bureaucrats to increase red-tape behind closed doors.”
Praise for the decision
Democrats, LGBTQ allies and environmental advocates said it was JCRAR’s practices, often shrouded in secrecy — not the rule-making process — that interfered with democracy.
“Today’s court decision is a victory for Wisconsinites, who deserve the freedom to have a government responsive to everyday people, not special interests and right-wing extremists,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison). “This decision sends a clear message: We are working toward making Wisconsin a place where everyone can build a better life.”
Abigail Swetz, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Fair Wisconsin,  called the outcome “a powerful step in the right direction towards ending the harmful practice of conversion therapy,” and credited the advocacy of NASW-Wisconsin and other community members and partner groups.
Swetz also urged lawmakers and the governor to take “an even more powerful step” by passing SB 324, legislation banning conversion therapy in all licensed professions.
In a joint statement the Legislature’s LGBTQ+ caucus called the ruling “a victory against the abusive and discredited practice of ‘conversion therapy’ and a victory for LGBTQ+ people who want to live as their authentic selves.”
Environmental impact
Environmental rules were not at the heart of the Court’s ruling Tuesday, but environmental groups said the outcome would strengthen efforts to enact stronger environmental protections.
“The bottom line is that good environmental rules now face a much easier path to getting to the finish line and becoming law—which is good for the environment and public health,” said Evan Feinauer, an attorney for Clean Wisconsin, in a statement the organization issued.
Clean Wisconsin said JCRAR has  blocked regulations on PFAS contamination, nitrates, surface water pollution and remediating contaminated lands.         
“Far too often in recent years JCRAR’s ability to object to any proposed rule, for almost any reason, or no stated reason at all, prevented agencies like DNR from doing their jobs,” Feinauer said. “That political gridlock prevented our government from being responsive to environmental and public health challenges.”
In a statement from Midwest Environmental Advocates, executive director Tony Wilkins Gibart said that through JCRAR’s control of the rulemaking process, “small groups of legislators have been able to block the implementation of popular environmental protections passed by the full legislature and signed by the governor.”
MEA filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Wisconsin Conservation Voters and Save Our Water, a group of residents affected by PFAS contamination in and around Marinette and Peshtigo.
When JCRAR blocked a rule in December 2020 that regulated firefighting foam containing PFAS, it perpetuated the discharge of PFAS-contaminated wastewater in the Marinette wastewater treatment plant, MEA said Tuesday.
“Committee vetoes were anti-democratic because they allowed a handful of legislators to make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Jennifer Giegerich, government affairs director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said in the MEA statement. “We’re pleased this ruling restores constitutional balance and strengthens accountability for environmental decisions that impact all Wisconsinites.”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A New Jersey law that acts as a privacy shield for judges and law enforcement officers faced scrutiny Tuesday during a hearing in front of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
Both sides in the case suggested that a ruling in the other’s favor would have a “chilling” impact — either on the First Amendment or on the livelihood of those in public service. The statute, known as Daniel’s Law, allows certain public officials to keep their home addresses secret, and a group of data brokers and other companies like media outlets argue it is overly broad, unconstitutional on its face, and violates their free speech rights. They are seeking to have the law struck down.
“The chilling effect here is that people are invoking the statute saying that I am barring you from disclosing this information in any context whatsoever, for any reason, regardless of what I myself are doing, and I can get a thousand bucks for that,” said Michael Berry, attorney for news and digital information company Thomson Reuters, which opposes the law.
The case before the 3rd Circuit began when Atlas Data Privacy Corp. sued numerous data brokers on behalf of individuals covered by Daniel’s Law. Atlas alleges the data brokers did not comply with requests for personal information to be taken down — and says they owe damages that could amount to millions of dollars.
Under the law, businesses that receive a takedown request must comply within 10 days or they can be sued for $1,000 per claim.
The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office joined Atlas in Philadelphia Tuesday to defend the law. The three-judge panel asked why data brokers who receive a takedown request should believe that someone is a cop or a judge without requiring verification before complying. 
“What if it’s — there are 400 Michael Zuckermans in my database, I guess I’m just going to take them all down because I got this notice?” asked Judge Cindy K. Chung.
“In that kind of applied circumstance where there is someone who has a very, very common name, multiple John Smiths, the data broker could, of course, go back to that John Smith and say, ‘We’re so sorry. We’re having trouble figuring this out. We’ve got a number of John Smiths,’” said Michael Zuckerman, a deputy state solicitor general.
Berry argued that New Jersey could have enacted a more narrowly tailored statute that would not face challenges, noting that the law here bars disclosure with no exceptions and allows people to be punished for releasing information that is made available by the government.
“Here, we’re not dealing with information that is actually private, nor that there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy because it has historically been a matter of public record,” he said. 
Judge Stephanos Bibas replied: “Well, New Jersey is now changing the reasonable expectation of what’s private.”
Daniel’s Law was enacted in 2020 following the murder of Daniel Anderl, the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas. Anderl was killed when a disgruntled attorney attempted to assassinate Salas after obtaining the judge’s home address online. The law allows public officials to request that their home addresses and phone numbers be kept confidential, with civil and criminal penalties possible for anyone who ignores those requests. Since 2020, lawmakers have amended the law to broaden who the law applies to and permit the recovery of attorneys’ fees and punitive damages if someone willfully disregards the law.
Tuesday’s hearing was not the first time that the privacy law has faced a legal challenge.
The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the law in June, ruling that it bars journalists from printing the home addresses of certain public officials.
Also last month, a separate case initiated by Atlas cleared an initial hurdle when U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle rejected the defendants’ motion to dismiss the roughly 40 lawsuits involved.
It is not clear when the 3rd Circuit will rule on the case it heard Tuesday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-08 20:57:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Corps revises Pearl River flood study, sets new comment period",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/08/corps-revises-pearl-river-flood-study-sets-new-comment-period/,The Corps of Engineers released a revised study on potential flood controls for the of the Pearl River that runs through Jackson.,"Heading into the Fourth of July weekend last Thursday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a revised study on potential flood controls for the part of the Pearl River that runs along Jackson. The Corps has narrowed its focus to two proposals, and only one of them would resemble the long-debated “One Lake” plan.  
The latest step in an effort decades in the making, the 243-page document highlights an array of flood control measures such as building levees, lowering the river’s banks, and elevating and floodproofing vulnerable structures.
The public can view the study, submit comments and find information on upcoming public meetings through the Corps’ website. The public comment period lasts until Aug. 18. 
In last week’s study, which is a revision of a draft the Corps released last year, the agency wrote that “Alternative E1” could be the “NED plan,” or the option that most aligns with the Corps’ cost-benefit criteria. Alternative E1 includes all the above mentioned measures, but notably omits building a dam that would essentially create a lake on the Pearl River. 
The idea to pool a section of the river into a lake has been a key component of proposals local officials have favored for years. From 2011 until last year, the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District, the project’s local government sponsor, pushed an idea coined as “One Lake,” which would have widened the river f0r recreational use. While the Corps last year determined One Lake’s cost wasn’t justifiable, the agency instead pitched a dialed back version of the idea as the potential NED plan.

The Corps in its new study said that plan, “Alternative D1,” may have more potential for recreation than E1, but added that the two options have equal flood control benefit. The agency’s final selection, it wrote, will likely come down to those two proposals.
The costs of either would be considerably more than what the Corps considered last year: E1, the agency estimates, could cost between $708 million and $753 million, while D1 could cost between $873 million and $918 million. While the Corps pledged $221 million towards the project in 2022, the federal government is only responsible for 65% of costs, meaning the local flood control district, also called the levee board, would have to raise between $248 million and $321 million for the remaining balance through a combination of local taxes and state appropriations.
Levee board attorney Keith Turner told Mississippi Today that either proposal would expand the district to include more homes. Turner said that for many homes, tax payments needed to fund either project would still be lower than what they pay for flood insurance now. 
Part of the higher costs comes from four levees, totaling about 6 miles, that the Corps includes in both D1 and E1: a levee that would protect 250 homes in the Canton Club neighborhood; a levee in northeast Jackson that would protect 415 homes, but would require the acquisition of two other homes; a levee that would protect 40 homes in south Jackson; and one that would protect 40, mostly industrial, structures in Richland. 
Both projects would also “adversely affect” endangered or threatened species within the Pearl River’s natural habitats, the study says, including three different types of turtles. D1, the Corps wrote, would impact a wider range of species, including the Gulf sturgeon, than E1.

In a presentation to board members at a Monday meeting, Turner said he disagreed with “a lot” of what’s in the new study and that the board will submit a long list of comments to the Corps. For instance, he said the Corps’ greatly inflated its cost estimates with overly safe projections. Turner added the Corps didn’t consider additional maintenance costs from maintaining the shortened river banks under E1, which would just be underwater under D1.
The board last year gave its support to Alternative D (the same as D1 without the levees, which weren’t included in last year’s study), although Turner said their support doesn’t necessarily impact what the Corps chooses. 
Turner said the current timeline would allow the Corps’ final study to come out in November, and then a final decision to be made in December. That call would fall to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works, a currently vacant role. President Trump earlier this year nominated Adam Telle for the position, leaving it up to the Senate to confirm the choice. Telle, Magnolia Tribune reported in May, has ties to the state, including having worked for former Sen. Thad Cochran, who once advocated for the project in his role in the Appropriations Committee.
The Corps is preparing to hold a series of public meetings, including a virtual meeting on July 14, in-person meetings in Monticello on July 29, Slidell on July 30, and in Jackson on July 31. Information on those meetings is also available on the agency’s website.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06150220/Pearl-River-flooding5.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 20:54:31+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont finishes review of 203 bills passed in 2025 with a veto,Mark Pazniokas and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/lamont-vetoes-bil/,Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a measure Tuesday that would have given the town of Plainfield leverage in blocking a proposed trash-to-energy plant.,"On the last day to act on the 203 bills passed in the legislature’s annual session, Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a measure Tuesday that would have given the Eastern Connecticut town of Plainfield leverage in blocking a proposed trash-to-energy plant.
In vetoing House Bill 7004, the governor heeded calls by labor and business groups. The measure would have allowed environmental justice communities of a certain size to reverse decisions on permitting by the state through referendums.
“Allowing permitting decisions to be overturned by referenda undermines the principles of objectivity embedded in our state permitting processes, will discourage important investments in infrastructure and ultimately will drive up cost of living for residents,” Lamont wrote in his veto message.
The veto was his third and least controversial: The others were an omnibus housing bill that had been drafted in consultation with his office and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits to strikers, which had been passed despite his veto threat. 
The governor also had previously used a line-item veto to excise sections of two other bills that became law.
No attempted veto overrides are expected.
House Bill 7004 was passed by the Senate in the final hour of the annual session in a deal with the Republican minority, which can control the flow of business in a session’s final days by extending debates. The measure was called for a vote with the expectation of a veto by Lamont.
Construction trade unions had lobbied against the bill on the grounds it could prevent job-producing projects. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association also was opposed.
“Predictability is critical for those seeking to do business in our state,” Lamont wrote.
Under current law, referendums challenging permitting decisions by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection are only allowed in certain environmental justice communities located in towns with populations under 10,000. In addition, those referendums can only challenge a permit denial, not an approval. 
The bill would have increased that eligibility to towns with up to 16,000 residents, covering Plainfield and two dozen other communities, and would have allowed residents to challenge approved permits.
Its sponsor in the upper chamber, Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, denied that it had been drafted specifically to address the proposed waste-to-energy plant in her district.
Instead, she said it was intended to apply more broadly across Eastern Connecticut, which she noted is dotted with former mill towns that still bear the consequences of industrial pollution, and which is already home to three waste-to-energy facilities, in Plainfield, Lisbon and Preston. 
“Many of us in the delegation are tired of having the most populated area of Connecticut want to put stuff in the eastern part where it’s less populated, where people live here,” she said, even pointing to a year-old example when then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sought to build a state police firing range in Griswold. 
“Everything that maybe nobody else wants, they want to always push in Eastern Connecticut,” she said.
But another member of the Southeastern Connecticut delegation who served as the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Aundre Bumgardner, D-Groton, said that the Plainfield proposal had been the primary impetus for the bill. Bumgardner, whose district does not include Plainfield, said that Somers had introduced him to a few of her constituents from the town in order to hear their concerns about the proposed facility. 
“That came out of Plainfield,” he said. 
Bumgardner, who serves as vice chair of the Environment Committee, said that he agreed with Somers that the region has had to accept more than its fair share of polluting facilities and that local governments should have more say in future siting decisions. 
“I think at the end of the day, every resident of a community should have the ability to vocalize strongly, vocalize where they stand on projects or infrastructure projects or facilities that are proposed to be sited in their backyard,” Bumgardner said. “Again, whether they’re urban, rural or suburban communities, they should have that right.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday that Iowa officials have contacted the White House to be involved in discussions on how to keep immigrant agricultural workers in the country.
The governor spoke about the budget reconciliation bill Tuesday outside the Iowa Capitol with Bob Quinn, host of The Big Show, a farm radio show on WHO Radio. Reynolds, Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig attended the show’s Sweet Corn Day event, which included discussions on the radio program as well as sweet corn provided by Titan Goodyear Tires.
Both Reynolds and Naig sat down for interviews with Quinn at the event. While the state officials did talk about their love for corn, they also talked about other issues impacting Iowa’s agriculture sector — including a proposal introduced by President Donald Trump during remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday on allowing farm workers without legal status to stay in the country with support from their employers.

Trump said at the event that the issue was brought up by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, who had said the Trump administration’s mass deportations have negatively impacted farms and agricultural businesses in the country. Trump said he’s working on legislation with Rollins and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem that would aid these impacted businesses and farms by allowing employers to vouch for their undocumented employees to allow them to remain in the country.
“We figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written,” Trump said. “And let the farmers be responsible.”
Reynolds told Quinn that Iowa has reached out to the Trump administration to be involved in the discussions of this policy, and to “actually continue to highlight how important it is so that we get this right.”
“Secretary Rollins has done a great job of just pointing out the need in agriculture for this outside labor — a lot of them being there year after year after year,” Reynolds said. “And it’s how we make things work. So it’s really important to the industry that we’re able to maintain that.”
The governor added that these discussions were something that should follow having a secure U.S. border, but said that because of the Trump administration’s actions on immigration law and border security, the country is in a place where stakeholders can have a “robust conversation” about what a program would look like to allow some workers to remain in the country.
Reynolds: Cuts in federal legislation will hit other states harder
Reynolds also said Iowa is equipped to deal with federal funding cuts made in the “big, beautiful bill” signed by Trump last week. Reynolds has praised Republicans in Congress for getting the measure to Trump’s desk, saying Thursday after the measure passed the U.S. House that it “reflects what everyday Americans believe — work should be rewarded, laws should be enforced, and government should get out of the way.”
The measure makes the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term, and increases spending for federal immigration enforcement efforts. It also includes spending cuts for public assistance programs, implementing Medicaid work requirements and shifting some funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from the federal government to states — changes hunger and health care advocates say will hurt people in need across the country.
However, Reynolds argued these changes will have a smaller impact on Iowa than in other states. Iowa has already moved forward to implement Medicaid work requirements on a state level through a law signed this session and a waiver request submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in April that include similar requirements to what was outlined in the budget reconciliation bill.
Many advocates have talked about how the changes to Medicaid will also mean less money for health care providers, prompting concerns in Iowa about further closures of rural hospitals and health care providers. Reynolds said she believes some of these concerns can be addressed through provisions passed in her rural health care bill, which includes measures to seek more federal funding to implement a “hub-and-spoke” model to create more regionalized rural health care services that provide easier access to general and specialized care.
“That will really help make sure that no matter where you live in the state of Iowa, especially in rural Iowa, that you have access to high quality health care,” Reynolds said.
She said she has also reached out to the federal government on this topic. Iowa’s existing Centers of Excellence Program is a model for this health care system, Reynolds said, which she said could show the administration how giving states flexibility, “alongside the funding,” could help improve rural health care availability.
She also said Iowa is working to address SNAP payment errors, the metric used that would trigger states’ payment for SNAP benefits under the law. States with payment error rates above 6%, as assessed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, would be required to pay into the system beginning in 2028.
Iowa’s payment error rate in Fiscal Year 2024 was 6.14% — just above the cutoff. Only eight states — Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming were below the threshold in FY 2024.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Department of Education has begun writing regulations to implement some of the education-related bills lawmakers approved this spring, including the training teachers must have to respond to children experiencing allergic reactions.
The Department of Education held three brief public meetings on the proposed regulations Tuesday, the first step in the rulemaking process. Ultimately, the state Board of Education must approve the rules following a mandatory public-comment period.
New laws seek to protect student athletes, restrict corporal punishment

SB 1514 requires an “adequate number” of charter and traditional public school personnel to be trained to respond to allergic reactions, including administering epinephrine. 
Language drafted by the department defines “adequate number” as “trained personnel and contracted personnel whose duties include regular contact with a student who has experienced or is at risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis.”
According to the draft language, the training must include recognition of symptoms of an allergic reaction, administering an epinephrine delivery device that contains a pre-measured dose, and procedures for accessing and recommending care when students are on school grounds. Specific language can be found here.
The department posts its approved trainings to its website.
Existing regulations require students to have a health plan with the school nurse regarding life-threatening allergies, including a plan of action for students unable to inject themselves with epinephrine. 
Form of high school diplomas and certificate of completion
Another rule discussed Tuesday relates to HB 1105, which, in part, eliminates certificates of completion. The certificates are given to students who complete credits required to graduate but do not score high enough grade point averages to graduate. 
Eliminating the certificate better sets students up for success, lawmakers said when debating the bill.
Lawmakers suggested that most jobs either require a high school diploma, college degree, or neither, rendering a certificate of completion effectively useless. Eliminating the certificate, lawmakers argued, would encourage students to study harder.
The state is taking public comment on draft language eliminating the certificates and changing rules establishing graduation requirements for students with disabilities. 
Community service for Bright Futures
The department discussed a proposed rule for high school students to more easily earn community-service hours needed to qualify for the Bright Futures scholarship, the Lottery-funded merit award for in-state students going to college.
The rule change would allow high schoolers working as paid tutors for the Reading Achievement Initiative for Scholastic Excellence (RAISE) program to count their work hours as the requisite community-service hours. Existing regulations permit only unpaid hours.
RAISE is designed to increase reading scores for elementary students and includes an opportunity for high school students to provide tutoring. 
The highest level of the Bright Futures scholarship requires students to perform 100 hours of community service. 
A date has not been set for the Board of Education to approve the rules.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 20:39:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Two more CT unions break off contract talks with Lamont,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/two-more-ct-unions-break-off-contract-talks-with-lamont/,"The Judicial Branch unions declared an impasse after being offered $2,000 bonuses, just days after Lamont’s office said it would offer raises.","Two more state employee bargaining units declared an impasse Tuesday with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration after the Executive Branch offered $2,000 lump sum bonuses in lieu of raises.
The breakdown in talks between the administration and unions representing judicial marshals and their immediate supervisors comes just six days after Lamont’s office insisted it was preparing to offer raises to bargaining units.
The latest declarations now mean three bargaining units have stopped negotiations with the governor and are preparing to seek arbitration. The 1,300-member Judicial Professional Employees Union, which represents probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, announced an impasse July 2.
But unless Lamont — whose administration has pledged raises on multiple occasions — strikes a compromise, it could find itself at odds with the bulk of state government’s unionized workforce, even as the governor weighs launching a campaign for a third term in the near future.
“We have to wonder if, from where he sits, the governor even sees the lives of working families and the public they serve,” said Bobby Perez, president of the 100-member marshal supervisors’ unit within CSEA-SEIU Local 2001, who said the lump-sum payments won’t address problems with recruitment, retention and a rising cost of living.
 About 35 bargaining units, nearly all of state government’s unionized workforce, are working under contracts that expired when the current fiscal year began July 1.
Lamont negotiated, and legislators approved, a new contract in late May for nearly 900 unionized state police troopers, granting those employees a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase this fiscal year. A step typically adds about 2 percentage points, bringing the effective value of the raise to about 4.5%.
“The decision to withhold a raise for some state workers, while others, like the State Police, receive the raises they deserve, shows a blatant disregard for the hard-working public servants who keep this state running,” Perez said. “We will not accept this disrespect, and we will continue to fight for the fair wages our members have earned.”
Angelo Arena, president of IBPO Local 731, which represents about 700 judicial marshals, said, “We now face the reality of working under an expired contract without the wage increases we deserve, all while health care costs continue to rise. As a result, our courthouses remain critically understaffed, and the public remains at risk.”
Lamont’s office told The Connecticut Mirror last week, shortly after the Judicial Professional Employees Union became the first unit to pursue arbitration, that offers of raises were forthcoming for all unions.
The Lamont administration did not comment Tuesday immediately after the two latest bargaining units to break off talks made their announcement.
The governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said last week that “Gov. Lamont immensely values the contributions of our state employees, as evidenced by consistent wage increases, and our offer will reflect that.”
Since 2021, as Connecticut has enjoyed unprecedented surpluses driven by aggressive and increasingly controversial budget caps, most unionized workers have received effective annual raises of 4.5%.
But negotiations typically address work conditions and other issues besides compensation.
And while administration officials haven’t disclosed specifics, the governor and many legislators have expressed increasing concerns over remote-work rules, set up shortly after COVID struck Connecticut in spring 2020, and their effects on productivity. Unions have been reluctant to alter those work-from-home rules.
Still, state employee unions have been clear they will hold the governor to his word when it comes to raises.
Lamont told hundreds of members of Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, during an April 25 conference in Mystic, that “Every year that I’ve been here, you’ve gotten a raise, and every year I’m here, you’re going to get a raise.”
But the governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, often has been at odds with labor over his budget policies.
Union leaders say the administration has been too slow to rebuild a workforce that shrank during the 2010s to help close frequent budget deficits.
They also say the governor has been too focused on building large fiscal reserves and paying down Connecticut’s sizeable pension debt to the detriment of education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
“Connecticut faces a public service crisis, and our leadership team stepped up to propose real solutions in contract talks with the Judicial Branch’s representatives,” said Rob Moreau, president of the Judicial Professional Employees Union, which broke off contract talks with the administration last week after no raise had been offered. “We were focused on addressing recruitment and retention gaps by boosting investments in the staff that all state residents depend on. Unfortunately, branch representatives came up short on the kind of appropriate pay that would make a difference.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5682.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

Childcare Arkansas includes a range of search options such as county, city, ZIP code and “Better Beginnings” quality ratings. The Arkansas Department of Human Services ranks childcare quality on a scale of one to six.
The database also allows searches for specific criteria such as the ages of the children accepted at a facility, hours of operation, whether transportation is provided and whether the provider accepts school vouchers via the LEARNS Act. The search function includes an interactive map of results.
The LEARNS Act is a wide-ranging 2023 education law that includes several early childhood education provisions, among them the requirement for the new “parent-friendly” website. The law also requires “local lead” organizations throughout the state to assess local and regional access to pre-K and what gaps or barriers should be addressed. The Childcare Arkansas site includes a search function for local leads.
“Through the LEARNS Act, which created the Local Leads program, and tools like this website, we are empowering Arkansas families to make informed decisions and helping set our children on the path to success from early childhood on,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in Monday’s news release announcing Childcare Arkansas.
The website also allows parents to file complaints against childcare facilities and search the School Readiness Assistant portal, which provides eligible families with “free or reduced childcare at approved state licensed providers, pending the availability of funds,” according to the portal’s website.
Arkansans face more challenges than most accessing child care, report shows

The LEARNS Act also moved the state’s Office of Early Childhood from the Department of Human Services to the Department of Education. The law “codified a commitment to improve access to quality childcare providers and streamlined education from cradle to career,” Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said in Monday’s news release.
In 2023, childcare for infants in Arkansas cost only 1.8% less than four-year public college tuition and 22.5% less than the average rent cost, according to a study released earlier this year by the Economic Policy Institute.
Arkansans have historically faced more challenges accessing quality childcare than residents of other states, and Arkansas remains one of the worst states for child well-being overall, according to the Annie E.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office will consider joining a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency, he told Newsline in an exclusive interview on Saturday.
Last week, the Trump administration’s Bureau of Land Management invoked the emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of a permit to expand a loading facility near Price, Utah for oil coming out of the nearby Uinta Basin. The expansion could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day.
It’s anticipated that the expansion of what’s known as the Wildcat Loadout facility — located on publicly owned federal lands — and other nearby facilities will allow the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for transport in the Uinta Basin Railway project. Eagle County and state officials have long opposed increased oil trains along the Colorado River.
In a June 27 letter to Jerry Davis, acting Utah state director for the BLM, Weiser wrote that an expedited environmental assessment for the proposed Wildcat right-of-way expansion would be a “violation of applicable laws and regulations” that would block proper public input and “subject Colorado communities to significant economic, environmental, and health and safety risks.”
Weiser argued there is no national energy emergency given the United States produced more oil last year than any nation in history, and he urged the BLM to follow standard, legally required procedures in reviewing the project. An attorney for Eagle County and an environmental group that successfully sued the federal government to delay the rail project, also sent letters.
But late Thursday, the BLM issued its approval, finding “no significant impact” related to the expansion, which Colorado opposes due to increased derailment, wildfire and oil-spill risks, and the agency directly cited its authority under Trump’s January executive order declaring a national energy emergency, allowing for the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects.
On Saturday, before a fundraiser here for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, Weiser said he had not heard about the expedited approval of the Wildcat Loadout or had time to debrief the ruling.
“I am sorry to hear that. I’m not shocked, but it’s a sign of the times we’re in — the lack of stewardship to protect our land, air, and water is appalling,” Weiser said. “We’re going to have to be creative to find every way we can to make sure that these decisions aren’t being made hastily with long-term, harmful consequences.”
In May, 15 states — led by the attorneys general in Washington and California — filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s energy emergency executive order. Calling it a “fake” emergency designed to line the pockets of Big Oil, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown pointed to the order’s exclusion of clean energy projects as it strips away vital environmental protections.
The May lawsuit claims Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency is a violation of the National Emergencies Act itself, which is designed to prevent frivolous or partisan declarations.
“We don’t think it is a real emergency,” Weiser said Saturday. “Up until now, this national energy emergency order hasn’t affected Colorado. But given these dynamics (of the expedited BLM approval), we’re going to be looking at that to make sure that we can do all we can to protect Colorado.”
Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited what they deemed illegal fast-tracking of environmental reviews by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in violation of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other key environmental laws.
“The only ‘emergency’ is that the president disagrees with policies to address climate change in Washington state and elsewhere,” Brown wrote in May. “He is illegally using emergency authorities to keep the nation reliant on energy sources like coal, oil and gas.”
Weiser has previously said he will keep all of his options open in opposing the Uinta Basin oil expansion as it seeks to vastly expand oil-train traffic along the headwaters of the endangered Colorado River, which supplies water to more than 40 million people. The BLM approval in a two-week window now has him questioning Trump’s national energy emergency rules.
“So we didn’t have an ability to make this case [back in May], but we at the time said that we would be looking closely at whether and when it would affect Colorado and we’d be ready to file,” Weiser said Saturday. “And with this, now we have to look at it.”

Article summary

The domestic policy law signed by President Donald Trump last week creates new work requirements that could jeopardize food assistance benefits for 360,000 Illinoisans.
Illinois will be required to cover a greater portion of the administrative costs and benefits of SNAP, which could cost several hundred million dollars.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes will substantially reduce costs for the federal government while most states will have to pay significantly more.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 


Hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans could lose benefits from a federal food assistance program while the state will be required to cover more costs under changes passed in the latest domestic policy plan.

President Donald Trump signed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” into law on July 4, making sweeping changes to social services programs, including Medicaid. Among the programs being revamped is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. The bill institutes new work requirements for many people to remain eligible for benefits and shifts some costs for the program to the states.

Food stamps were first established in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Renamed to SNAP in 2008, the program provides monthly stipends for low-income Americans to purchase select foods at grocery stores. While states implement the program and pay a portion of administrative expenses, the federal government has historically covered the cost of the benefits.

Under the law, work requirements to qualify for SNAP benefits have been expanded to include people up to age 64, along with homeless people, veterans and young adults leaving foster care. Previously, only people age 18-54 had to meet work requirements.

Those populations didn’t previously have to prove they were doing a certain amount of work, but when the changes kick in, they will have to do 80 hours of paid, unpaid or volunteer work each month to qualify for benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The law continues to provide exemptions for people who are physically unable to work, such as for pregnancy.

The changes could leave 360,000 people in Illinois at risk of losing eligibility, according to the state.

“Trump and Republicans would rather children go hungry so their friends can receive tax cuts,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “Here in Illinois, we have been working to combat food insecurity for years, and while no state can backfill these costs, the State of Illinois will continue to fight against these harmful impacts and stand up for working families.”

About 1.9 million people were using SNAP in Illinois as of March 2025, according to the USDA.

New costs for the state

Illinois and most other states will have to cover a greater portion of costs for SNAP under the law, including benefits based on the state’s error rate of over- and under-payments on benefits.

Beginning in federal fiscal year 2028, which begins in October 2027, the law requires states with an error rate greater than 10% as of at least FY25 to cover 15% of the cost of benefits. States with lower error rates would cover a smaller portion of the benefits. Illinois recorded an 11% error rate in FY24, according to the USDA.

More than 1.8 million Illinoisians received $4.7 billion of SNAP benefits in FY25, according to the state. If Illinois must pay 15% of the cost of benefits, it could leave the state on the hook for $705 million — or about 1.3% of the current-year budget.

Also beginning in federal fiscal year 2027, which begins in October 2026, states will have to cover 75% of administrative costs for SNAP, rather than 50%. This year’s state budget appropriates $60 million for administrative costs for SNAP — up $20 million from last year.

The changes are part of initiatives by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to shift more responsibility for assistance programs to states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates changes to SNAP will reduce federal spending by $279 billion over 10 years but increase state spending on SNAP by $121 billion over the same time. The CBO predicts some states could abandon the program or choose to provide a lower level of benefits and not make up for reductions Congress made to the program.

Pritzker and 22 other governors sent a letter to Congress last month saying it’s possible states will have to leave or reduce the SNAP program because of the new cost requirements.

O. Williams Hall on the campus of the Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Baton Rouge. (Photo courtesy Southern University)Nine Southern University students who had their visas revoked by the Trump administration earlier this year have since had them reinstated, according to the university. 
Seven of the students are enrolled at Southern University’s main campus in Baton Rouge and two are at Southern University at New Orleans. 
The nine students had their visas revoked in early April without explanation from federal officials, Southern spokeswoman Janene Tate said at the time. She did not disclose the students’ names, citing the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
The Southern students are among 16 international students enrolled at Louisiana universities known in April to have lost their visas in the Trump administration’s sweeping termination of at least 1,800 students’ legal status to study in the United States. 
Of the seven other students, three were enrolled at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and two each attended the University of New Orleans, Tulane University according to representatives with the schools. 
Two LSU students have since had their visas revoked, according to LSU spokesman Todd Woodward. 
The university confirmed that two Iranian-born students were arrested by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last month. 
One of the students, Pouria Pourhosseinhendabad, is currently being detained at the ICE facility center in Jena. The agency has not responded to requests for comment about why he is being detained.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Sweat beaded on foreheads inside the sweltering warehouse of 84 Lumber on Richmond’s Southside Tuesday, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin appeared unfazed by the heat as he declared victory on one of his administration’s signature promises — slashing red tape across Virginia’s government by 25%.
“The heart of the day is recognizing that when we reduce the burdens of excess regulations on businesses in Virginia, businesses come, businesses thrive, businesses grow,” Youngkin said to applause. “Today is about results. Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”
Youngkin announced that Virginia has surpassed his administration’s goal of cutting regulatory requirements by 25%, six months ahead of schedule. 
The benchmark, established in Executive Order 19 during his first year in office, set in motion a sweeping review of every agency’s rules, guidance documents, and permitting practices — an effort that culminated in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 regulatory requirements and the elimination of 11.5 million words from official documents, according to state officials.
“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”
 From paperwork to paychecks

The governor connected the regulatory rollback to broader economic wins during his term, including more than $120 billion in corporate investment commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.
“Jobs that are open and ready,” Youngkin said. “And we have had 15,000 high-growth startups over the course of the last three years, and our goal is to get it to 20,000.”
While the administration emphasized the savings — pegged at $1.2 billion annually by the Office of Regulatory Management — Youngkin also said the effort was as much about speed and accessibility as cost.
“Regulatory and permitting timelines (have been) cut 65% in our Department of Environmental Quality,” he noted. “VDOT alone has eliminated 20,000 regulatory requirements, hundreds of pages of incorporated documents. That saves Virginians time — and time matters.”
 Housing, licensing, and stormwater

Youngkin pointed to housing as one of the clearest examples of regulatory reform making a difference.
“We went to look at the whole building code,” he said, “and said, ‘Let’s reduce (regulations), maintain safety, but let’s reduce them.’ What we found is $24,000 of cost savings to building a home — that reduces the cost of the home by nearly 6%. That means someone has to pay less to get into the home of their dreams.”

Hans Klinger, a real estate executive and president of the Home Builders Association of Virginia, said the impact has been felt throughout the industry.
“Regulation affects every part of (the homebuilding) process — what gets built, how long it takes, and what it costs,” Klinger said. “When the system becomes too complex or outdated, the burden extends beyond our builders. It pushes families out of homeownership, drives up rents and holds communities back.”
Klinger credited Brian Horn, director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, with leading a streamlining of more than 48,000 housing-related regulations. 
“Several individual items could have easily added $25,000 to $35,000 to the cost of a single home,” Klinger said. “That directly goes down to the homebuyer — it’s a pass-through cost.”
The Uniform Statewide Building Code is currently under formal review by the Department of Housing and Community Development. As part of that process, the state is accepting public comments on proposed changes through December. Virginians can weigh in by visiting the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall website.
Environmental regulations were also a major focus. Andrew Wheeler, the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief under President Donald Trump who helped launch Virginia’s Office of Regulatory Management, described the previous system as lacking accountability.
“We quickly discovered that over 50% of the regulations in Virginia were drafted by agencies and were not reviewed by anybody outside of the agency writing the regulation,” Wheeler said. “That’s just not good government.”
He offered stormwater regulations as a case study: “We had a stack of 23 inches of stormwater regulations and guidance documents, and we whittled that down to five inches.”
Wheeler did not elaborate further on which regulations were cut. 
 A “common sense” filter

Throughout his remarks, Youngkin emphasized that the process wasn’t about gutting public protections, but about eliminating redundancy and inefficiency.
“Why in the world do we have three competing (regulations)?” he asked. “Why do we demand the maximum level of insulation on everything we do that drives up housing costs?”
The process, he said, involved a practical “common sense score” alongside economic reviews. Some regulations stayed — especially those tied to health and safety — while others were restructured or repealed. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” Youngkin said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”
Agencies were tracked using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind and red for those lagging. “It allows us to focus management attention on who we need to put a little pressure on to get going,” Youngkin said.
The results varied by agency. Some exceeded the 25% benchmark, while others are still working toward it. But overall, the state’s regulatory code has been pared down by one-quarter — a milestone Youngkin says proves that “we can deliver results.”
Despite repeated references to the $1.2 billion in annual savings and 89,000 streamlined regulations, neither Youngkin nor administration officials on Tuesday provided a detailed breakdown of how those figures were calculated. The administration also did not release a full cost analysis or explain the specific methodology used to tally reductions across agencies.
 Legislative roots and next steps

Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, said the success of Youngkin’s effort builds on work that began under previous legislatures.
“In 2018 under Speaker Kirk Cox, we passed House Bill 883 — a pilot program dealing with occupational licenses and the Department of Criminal Justice,” said Webert, who sponsored the proposal. “Even with COVID and the delays, they still hit 25%. That goes to show you how overburdensome government can be.”
Youngkin’s reforms were institutionalized early in his term through the creation of the Office of Regulatory Management, which now oversees the review process, cost-benefit analysis and agency transparency. 
Under the administration, all agencies are required to annually publish a Unified Regulatory Plan, publicly outlining new or amended rules for the coming year. Guidance documents, permits, and actions are tracked on the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall website.
Wheeler said one of the biggest reforms was requiring economic analysis of not just new regulations, but also legacy rules. 
“We built off of the pilot program that was created for two agencies, requiring a 25% reduction across all agencies by the end of this year,” he said. “It’s only July — we’re not at the end of the year — and we’ve already met the 25% reduction.”
Youngkin, whose name continues to swirl in speculation about his political future beyond the Virginia governor’s mansion, was eager to link the policy win to broader economic momentum in Virginia.
“At the heart of our commonwealth today, businesses are thriving,” Youngkin said. “We broke through $120 billion of commitments from companies to invest in Virginia … and we’ve got roughly 200,000 jobs in Virginia that are ready for someone to say ‘Yes, thank you. I will come work for you.’”
Reflecting on the original pledge, Youngkin acknowledged he wasn’t sure exactly how his administration would meet the 25% reduction goal — but credits a coordinated effort across state government for delivering results ahead of schedule. 
“I didn’t know how we were going to do it,” he said. “But I knew we could. Now, we’re going for 35%.”

District 13 is solidly Republican. According to election results, Woods won 94% of votes in 2022 against libertarian Mark Davenport. 
The primary election will be on Sept. 30, with primary runoff on Oct. 28, if needed, according to a press release from the governor’s office. The general election will be on Jan. 13, 2026, which is the first day of the 2026 Legislative session.

All seven defendants made brief court appearances Tuesday before Judge Tracy Lee Dayton, and all had their cases continued to August 13. Dayton said on that date she expects to take a guilty plea from Josephine Edmonds, the first to do so.
The judge did not discuss the terms of that deal or whether Edmonds will get jail time or have to testify against other defendants.
Edmonds is facing four felony charges. including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election. Her attorney Public Defender James J. Pastore would not comment on the agreement.

Moments later, Dayton revealed that a second defendant, Jazmarie Melendez, also is negotiating a plea with the Chief State’s Attorney’s office and will meet prosecutors next week.
Deputy Chief State Attorney Lisa D’Angelo confirmed that the meeting will take place but did not say what any terms of a potential deal with Melendez would entail. 
D’Angelo made her first appearance in the case, replacing Kevin Lawlor, who recently retired. Lawlor has been in charge of the office’s multiyear investigation that led to all of the arrests.

Melendez is one of three sitting city council members facing election fraud charges for either mispresenting who is eligible to vote absentee, fraudulent voting, taking possession of voters’ absentee ballots or being present while voters filled out those ballots. Melendez is facing six felony counts from the 2023 mayoral election.
The five other defendants are city council members Maria Pereira and Alfredo Castillo, Margaret Joyce, Nilsa Heredia and Wanda Geter-Pataky. All had their cases continued until August 13.

Dayton said at that time she expects plea negotiations to occur with the other five defendants to see if a resolution to the cases can be reached, otherwise a trial date will be set. Attorneys for all of the defendants met with Dayton in her chambers for nearly a half hour.
While that meeting was occurring, several of the defendants, including Castillo and Geter-Pataky, sat together on a court bench, complaining about all the trips to court.
Geter-Pataky, the vice chair of the city’s Democratic Town Committee, is facing 92 separate criminal charges, including conspiracy to take possession of multiple voters’ absentee ballots. 
Heredia is facing similar charges as Edmonds from the 2019 election but has not entered plea discussions with the state yet.
Her attorney Ken Krayeske had applied for accelerated rehabilitation — a form of probation — for Heredia but was denied by Dayton, who signaled the case was not going to be business as usual.
Dayton said that allegations of election fraud and voter manipulation were serious matters comparable to cases stemming from the embezzlement of public funds.
“I have granted [accelerated rehabilitation] in very, very serious situations,” Dayton said. “I certainly understand my ability and discretion to do so. I find this case to be more serious. I think taking someone’s vote is more serious than taking someone’s money.”
Meanwhile, Joyce, who lists no permanent address, was recently fined $1,000 by the State Elections Enforcement Commission for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law for her actions in the 2024 Bridgeport elections. 
According to State Elections Enforcement Commission staff, Joyce told state investigators that she was compensated during those 2024 elections for the sole purpose of soliciting absentee votes — which is a violation of state law. They said she also admitted to taking possession of at least one voter’s absentee ballot ahead of those contests, which is a felony in Connecticut.
Joyce is currently facing nine criminal charges from the state’s investigation of the 2023 elections.
SEEC’s decision in the Joyce case is likely to seep into the criminal case, as Krayeske has questioned why low-level party members like Heredia are facing jail time while party leaders and Mayor Joseph Ganim remained untouched.
“What is there in this process that would discourage candidates for the office of the mayor for the city of Bridgeport from putting indigent people in this position, over and over and over again?” SEEC Chairman Stephen Penny said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023_1212_SR_Fireside_008-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 16:10:49.435543

(Getty Images)In 2024, the max temperature in Phoenix sat at or above 100 degrees for approximately 30% of the year — and that non-stop consecutive heat has environmental advocates and doctors worried about the years to come as climate change continues to make the world and Arizona hotter.
Last year saw Arizona break a number of heat related records and Phoenix experienced 113 consecutive days of 100 degrees or hotter, the longest run ever recorded. The next highest run was set in 1993 and was 76 days, the third longest run is from 2023 at 66 days.



In fact, a number of the most recent heat-related records all come from more recent years. The top 10 for the most consecutive days with temperatures at or above 110 includes 2020, 2021 and 2022. The record was shattered in 2023, when Phoenix experienced 31 consecutive days of 110 degrees or higher heat.
This year has already had a 17-day run of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees, including seven where highs were above 110.
The records have also taken a grim toll.
While 2024 was the hottest year on record for the state, there was a slight decline in the number of heat-related deaths from the record-breaking 2023, where 645 people lost their lives in Maricopa County due to the heat. Those 645 deaths in 2023 made up more than half of all heat-related deaths reported nationally, according to Centers for Disease Control data.
Overall temperatures have been rising across the globe, contributing to what we are seeing in Arizona. The global temperature has risen by approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, but in Phoenix you can add another 5 degrees to that number due to the urban heat island effect.

The urban heat island effect is when the temperatures in an urban area increase due to the heat retained by structures and ground coverings, lack of vegetation and other impacts of urbanization.
That heat island also leads to other environmental effects, such as more and more days where pollution lingers in the atmosphere.
A previous analysis of data from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality showed that Phoenix in recent years has experienced more days where the level of ozone in the air exceeds health and safety standards.

For example, in 2015, Phoenix experienced 33 exceedance days for the whole year. In 2022, the region experienced 53, a 60% increase.
“We are at the epicenter of this crisis in the United States and there is nothing that kills more in regards to global warming or extreme weather than heat,” Dr. Jack Tuber, a Phoenix pulmonologist and member of the Sierra Club said to the Mirror.
A ‘People’s Hearing’ 
On a hot Thursday evening when temperatures outside were a sweltering 103 degrees, local environmental advocates, students, physicians and more were gathering at South Mountain Community College to discuss the impacts of extreme weather.
The event featured a large number of groups from the Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter to the Union of Concerned Scientists, and even religious leaders who have opened their doors to vulnerable populations who often find themselves endangered by extreme heat.
The event, dubbed the “People’s Hearing” on extreme heat, featured representatives of Democrats Sen. Mark Kelly and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari. State Sen. Priya Sundareshan, a Tucson Democrat and former attorney who focused on climate issues, also attended.
While the event focused on the stories of those impacted by climate change and extreme weather, it also had another major goal: to implore policy makers to pay attention to the climate crisis and bring into focus concerns about President Donald Trump’s plans to roll back environmental protections.
Trump’s head of the EPA has vowed to eliminate regulations meant to curtail pollution, fire staffers that serve overburdened areas and push EPA scientists to approve new chemicals, moves that former and current employees have begun to voice their concerns over.
“I’m actually horrified at the administration’s planned rollbacks,” Vernon Morris, a climate scientist and Arizona State University professor. (Morris said at the event that he was speaking on behalf of himself and not the university.)

Morris voiced concerns over rollbacks to agencies like the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which scientists have warned could harm weather prediction models, leading to further harms and even deaths.
“There is no precedent for what we are experiencing today,” Dr. Ryan Glaubke, a paleoclimatologist and member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the audience. “We are pushing the climate into uncharted territory.”
Glaubke and other scientists who spoke all agreed that climate change is real, happening and that humans are largely responsible — observations that have consensus among the scientific community.
However, how to go about addressing that crisis and helping those directly impacted by it is not as easy to answer.
‘The weight of the sun’ 
It takes less than 30 seconds of being exposed to an object that 130 to 140 degrees to get a second- or third-degree burn, according to Dr. Clifford Sheckter, a burn surgeon at the Regional Burn Center at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in California.
Sheckter is also the Burn Prevention Committee Chair for the American Burn Association and does health policy research focusing on the prevention and health economics of burn care.
When the Mirror took the temperatures of common objects in Phoenix at midday in late June, temperatures regularly were dangerous. A sidewalk registered 136 degrees, the road was a blistering 146, a bike rack was 125 degrees, a mailbox clocked in at 136 and sand in a kid’s playground reached 131 degrees.

Those temperatures are already causing severe burns on people, particularly among the unhoused, those with drug and alcohol addiction issues and, as Sheckter pointed out, those with neuropathy.
Neuropathy is seen largely in people with diabetes and it is a condition where a person loses sensation in their hands or feet. Sheckter said they have seen patients who don’t realize they’ve burned their feet until it is too late.
The Phoenix Police Department has also come under fire for ignoring the danger of extreme heat. In June 2024, two officers held a woman down on the hot pavement leading to severe burns — and it wasn’t even the first time officers had caused similar injuries.
For the family members of people who work in the heat, though, the dangers are known to them and they’re only getting worse.
“Try to imagine the weight of the sun on your skin for 8 to 10 hours,” Jazmin Moreno, with the non-profit environmental advocacy organization Agave Community Threads, said to the crowd when speaking about her father who has worked in construction for the past 30 years. “This isn’t just weather, it is a climate crisis on full display… Climate change is real, and denying it won’t make the heat go away.”
For doctors like Sheckter and local pulmonologist Tuber, though, that crisis means an increase in certain types of cases and a new need for more education.
For burns, it means getting information to parents on how to make sure their kids are safe on playgrounds, and that those who have neuropathy are paying close attention.
“These are ways we’ve been able to save countless lives, through prevention,” Sheckter said, although he admitted that, “at the end of the day, there is no way you can force somebody to put their shoes on when they go outside.”
But for Tuber, the challenge is a bit more difficult.
Vector borne illnesses — those illnesses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas — are seeing a rise due to climate change. The change in the earth’s climate has allowed for the insects that carry these diseases to spread farther and wider than ever before, impacting new populations.
Illnesses like malaria, Lyme disease and the West Nile virus have all seen their numbers increase, with climate change being cited as a major contributing factor.
Add to Arizona specifically that more heat, less rain and more building also translates to an increase in coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, and you have what Tuber calls an “environmental disaster.”
The increase in heat is also not helpful for people’s lungs.
“The lungs are exposed, just like skin, to the ambient air temperatures, and if you are breathing drier, less moist air, you are going to be transpiring more humidity out from the lungs into the environment,” Tuber said, comparing it to like leaving a cut apple out. “There is a lot of truth to the heat causing more trouble to the lung than if there was not so much heat.”
This week, the state got its first monsoon storms of the season as the majority of the state is still under heat advisories and wildfires, made more aggressive by the drier conditions created by climate change, rage in the state.

Henry McMaster’s office said Tuesday.
More than 100 people, including 30 children, were killed when rivers in the Texas hills flooded over the weekend, inundating a girls’ summer camp along with nearby homes. At least 25 people remained missing as of Monday, though the total number unaccounted for was still unclear, The Texas Tribune reported.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott asked McMaster for the state’s help in a Monday phone call, according to the South Carolina governor’s office. McMaster obliged, deploying a specialized team from South Carolina Task Force 1, which is trained to find and, when possible, help people in all sorts of disaster scenarios.
The team includes two K-9s trained in detecting human remains through Greenville nonprofit Foothills Search and Rescue.
“Team South Carolina stands ready to offer any support we can,” McMaster said in a statement. “In some of our toughest moments, the people of Texas were there for us. Now, it’s our duty to return that support and stand by our friends in their time of need.”
Last year, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department employees traveled to South Carolina to help clean up debris left behind when Helene swept through the state as a tropical storm.
A federal mutual aid system called the emergency Management Assistance Compact helped coordinate the effort. South Carolina has long participated in the program and sends teams to help wherever disaster strikes, said Kim Stenson, director of the state’s Emergency Management Division.
“Over the years, we’ve helped coordinate assistance for incidents in Kentucky, Florida, California, Alaska, and now Texas,” Stenson said in a statement. “Our emergency response community stands ready and capable of answering the call when help is needed.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-floods-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 16:10:49.435543

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Peter Mancini leaned back in his shade-covered yellow-checkered lawn chair outside Veazie Street Elementary School Tuesday afternoon, gazing out at a parking lot filled with lawn signs, but no people.
Mancini was there to greet voters and potentially sway their choice for the open Rhode Island Senate District 4 seat before heading inside the Providence polling place. But his steamy stakeout had yielded little success, save for a sub sandwich dropped off by friends around noon.
“It’s the heat,” Mancini said of the lackluster turnout. “And, it’s a special election.”
The heat is on in R.I. Senate District 4 ahead of Tuesday’s Democratic primary

The race to fill the open seat in the district spanning North Providence and the northern part of Providence was prompted by the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Ruggerio died in April, after representing the district for 40 years.
Four Democrats are running: North Providence Town Councilperson Stefano Famiglietti, for whom Mancini was volunteering, along with former state Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, Lenny Cioe and Manny Taveras. 
The sleepy primary appeared to fly under the radar of many of the district’s 25,000 residents, including some who showed up to vote on Tuesday. 
Rhonda Cardin, a 59-year-old North Providence retiree, cast her ballot for Famiglietti, a family friend. But, leaving the polls at Dr. Joseph A. Whelan Elementary School Tuesday afternoon, Cardin confessed she didn’t recognize the names of the other candidates on the ballot.
“I want to be able to get in touch with my senator when I have a problem, and I know Stefano will be number 1,” Cardin said.
Oyeniran Oyewale, 47, a small business owner, struggled to recall Ranglin-Vassell’s name when explaining his support for her. But Oyewale touted Ranglin-Vassell’s message of change and support for residents — seniors, children and small businesses — as the most persuasive to him.
Oyewale and Cardin were among 30 voters who cast ballots at Whelan during a 45-minute midday period as the heat index climbed to nearly 100 degrees. In the seven hours since polls opened at 7 a.m., the Mineral Spring Avenue polling place welcomed 231 voters through its doors, despite construction work that limited onsite parking, said JoAnn Chiarini-Corey, the polling place moderator.
Just 1.5 miles south at Veazie Street, 57 ballots were cast through 1 p.m., said Robert Colantonio, moderator for the polling place.
More than 22,000 voters are registered to vote in the district, including nearly 10,000 Democrats, and 9,700 unaffiliated voters — a partisan bent that puts emphasis on the Democratic primary more than the general election.

Low drama race
Colantonio cited the heat and summer schedule as factors for the low turnout. But the race has also been low drama, said Colantonio, who has worked as a local polling administrator for 20 years.
There’s been little mud-slinging — or really any interaction at all — between candidates. But on Tuesday morning, Ranglin-Vassell said she reported one of Famiglietti’s supporters to the Rhode Island Board of Elections for allegedly breaking state election rules.
A video taken by Ranglin-Vassell and shared with Rhode Island Current shows Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and Famiglietti supporter, inside the Veazie Street polling place, asking poll workers for the number of on ballots cast. Ranglin-Vassell can be heard telling him, “You’re not supposed to be here.” 
Ranglin-Vassell later explained that Corvese was intimidating poll workers, and also breaking state rules preventing anyone but candidates from wearing campaign stickers inside a polling place. 
Corvese declined to comment.
The Board of Elections has not received any formal complaints as of 3 p.m. Tuesday, said Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Board of Elections. The Providence Board of Canvassers has not received complaints either, Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, confirmed via email. 
Despite her frustration with Corvese, Ranglin-Vassell said the day was “going great,” as she greeted voters outside Whalen early Tuesday afternoon. 
The mood inside was similarly cheery, despite the lack of air conditioning. Poll workers fanned themselves and chatted about the pending forecast, which included a heat advisory and a flash flood watch. 
“That could be bad,” Chiarini-Corey said to another poll worker of the weather forecast.
Bad not just for commuters, but also candidates relying on a post-work rush to boost turnout.
Many of the midday voters were retirees, including Joel Darelius, a former maintenance supervisor for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. Darelius, 72, of North Providence, insisted that funding the cash-strapped public bus service should be a top priority of state lawmakers, including his new state senator.
“I think it’s ridiculous,” Darelius said of the General Assembly’s refusal to fully close the agency’s deficit. “It’s a public service.”
Bill Sullivan, 59, was fueled more by national politics in his decision to cast a ballot Tuesday. Sullivan, a former Democrat who became a Republican in 2016, had to disaffiliate in order to participate in the Democratic primary. Sullivan cast his ballot for Famiglietti, citing his history on the North Providence Town Council.
“The other people are too far left for me,” Sullivan said. “I don’t like their agenda.”
He did not give specific examples of policies he disliked among the other candidates when asked.
Voting continues through 8 p.m. Tuesday, with unofficial results from the Board of Elections expected shortly after. The winner of the primary will face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, in an Aug. 5 general election to decide who serves the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) is working with her congressional colleagues to introduce legislation that will seek to counter China’s stranglehold on critical materials and set aside $10 billion to make it happen.
Unveiled Tuesday, the Unearth America’s Future Act was described as a means to lower costs, create jobs and ensure Michigan workers and manufacturers are leading the way in critical mineral production.
At present, the U.S. and many other nations are dependent on China for these materials, including cobalt, lithium and magnesium, which are needed in the manufacture of many high tech electronics. Stevens’ bill aims to fix that by putting money toward responsible domestic mineral production. The legislation would also support partnerships between government and private industry, with investments in innovation that would keep jobs in Michigan.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Donald Trump has pushed an agenda that puts our economy and national security at risk,” Stevens said in a statement. “They talk tough and make headlines but their policies have only caused prices to rise, weakened our manufacturing industries, and left America more dependent on China. This bill is about real results.”
Stevens’ bill would enact a three-part strategy on critical material production. It would provide direct federal incentives, focus on innovation investment and create fair labor policies around production.
The incentives would aim to boost domestic mineral production, while the investment portion would aim to drive clean and competitive manufacturing. The act is currently supported by United Steelworkers and was developed with collaboration from other labor, industry, environmental and trade organizations.
Stevens is one of several Democrats seeking the nomination next year to run for the U.S. Senate seat being opened up by the retirement of U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township). Also in the running are state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit).",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4041632-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 16:10:49.435543

House Minority Leader Brad Jones and his colleagues will find their own work altered as a result of what President Donald Trump signed into law.
The post Sour taste as Mass. pols unpeel ‘big, beautiful bill’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE TOP REPUBLICAN in the Massachusetts House is still parsing the so-called “big, beautiful bill” that became law Friday to figure out where he lands.
House Minority Leader Brad Jones is nearly certain of one thing, though: he and his colleagues will find their own work altered as a result of what President Donald Trump signed into law.
“This [law] is, what, nearly 1,000 pages, touches on hundreds of different aspects of tax and public policy and spending policy?” Jones said in an interview Monday. “I would find it nearly impossible to think that the Legislature wouldn’t have something to do to bring us in sync, or to address something funding-wise that we view as a priority that’s now not going to be covered by the federal government.”
Top lawmakers, including Democrats who wield supermajority margins in both chambers, had their hands full over a long holiday weekend beginning to unpack one of the most significant new federal laws in decades, a package with major impacts for MassHealth, food aid, clean energy and more.
Rep. John Lawn, the point person for the House on most health care matters, said Monday he expects the new law to be “devastating” for Massachusetts — and he “do[es] not see any silver lining in these cuts.”
Hundreds of thousands of people who lose MassHealth coverage will still need care, Lawn said. He expects they will still show up in emergency rooms and “go into the free care pool,” further straining community hospitals and safety-net providers who are already struggling financially.
“The cuts will really ripple across our entire health care system,” he said.
His counterpart on the Health Care Financing Committee, Sen. Cindy Friedman, agreed.
“It’s not hyperbole to say that this bill is far from beautiful, and in fact is terrible for our economy, for our working-class residents, and for government operations of Massachusetts,” Friedman said in a statement.
Both Lawn and Friedman signaled they will have their hands full developing and navigating a legislative response — Friedman said “it will take an immense, collaborative effort to even begin to mitigate the negative impact this bill will have on just physical health here in Massachusetts” — to the Medicaid cuts.
However, Lawn said the timeline is not clear, especially because lawmakers are still trying to get a better grasp of the full scope of impacts.
“We’ve already been having discussions, but until we knew actually what the cuts would be, how we go from there will remain to be seen,” he said. “As you know, we’ve got a hospital system and health care system that’s very fragile going into this, and these cuts will really have effects downstream on our workforce, especially in our rural areas.”
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet released updated projections on how the final law could affect Medicaid enrollment by state. Nonprofit health policy organization KFF previously estimated the House version of the bill could cause 165,000 to 275,000 Bay Staters to lose coverage by 2034.

Food Security and Assistance
Tens of thousands of Bay Staters are also at risk of losing access to food aid.
The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute estimated that about 175,000 Bay Staters could lose some or all of their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits under the law, which according to anti-hunger group Project Bread tightens work requirements, eliminates SNAP eligibility for immigrants with legal status, and shifts a significant portion of program costs to state governments.
For about half a century, food stamp benefits have been completely funded by the federal government, while Washington and states split administrative costs evenly, according to Leran Minc, Project Bread’s director of public policy.
The new law will require states to pick up 75 percent of administrative costs and, depending on a state’s “error rate” in paying out aid, 5 percent to 15 percent of benefit costs. Minc said those two changes could together add roughly $450 million per year to the amount Massachusetts must pay per year to maintain SNAP.
“We’re very much concerned about what are we not going to be able to do, or what are we going to scale back on because we’re covering that amount,” Minc said.
“If the state ultimately decides that they can’t fund that, it’s a bit of an open question of what the federal government would do,” he added. “What’s expected is that cost-sharing, cost-shift would slide proportionally, so if the state was only able to cover half of their obligation, the federal government would likely only cover half of their obligation. That becomes a very big cut to the program, so then there have to be decisions made of, ‘How do we scale back eligibility and benefit levels?'”
Cost-sharing changes will not take effect immediately — especially if Massachusetts winds up triggering a carveout delaying implementation in states with the highest payment error rates — so there will be some time for lawmakers and Healey to craft a response plan.
Minc said Beacon Hill could also invest more to lower its payment error rate, which might lower the share of benefits that state government needs to cover.
“It would be really hard to walk away from that 85 percent and still find a way to help people meet their basic needs, so I believe once we think about all those different facts, as much as it’s a bitter pill to swallow, I feel fairly hopeful it is a pill they will swallow,” he said of the cost to cover benefits.
House and Senate Democrats in recent years have deployed state dollars to plug gaps opened up by changes to federal programs or to continue offering services once funded by the federal government, like free school meals and so-called C3 grants to early education providers.
While legislative leaders have not made any pledges yet, they’re already facing calls from advocacy groups to once again function as a financial cavalry.
“If we do not mitigate this federal damage in the Commonwealth, hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents will go hungry, get sicker, grow poorer, and struggle unnecessarily – and our local communities and economies will suffer the consequences,” said Georgia Katsoulomitis, executive director of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
Sen. Jo Comerford, a regular advocate for enhanced food security funding through SNAP and other programs, said Monday that the “big brutal betrayal bill” represents “cuts to lifeline programs” for people across Massachusetts. She said cuts to food aid programs are particularly surprising in light of increases in food insecurity nationally.
“They’re cutting at a time when folks are struggling more,” she said.
Comerford stressed that it will take time for the impacts of the new federal law to trickle through state agencies and for issues to reveal themselves. As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Steering, Policy and Scheduling, the Northampton Democrat is involved in the Senate’s “Response 2025” effort to address changes out of Washington. She said she believes state government is “bracing for real hardships here.” 
She said she has focused on protecting Bay Staters from federal cuts and has not identified a positive from the new federal law.
“We’re all preparing for how Massachusetts responds to what happens out of Congress and we’re doing it in, I think, responsible ways as we understand that it’s going to be a range of cuts, from health care to food security to other critical programs for constituents,” she said, pointing to an $800 million cushion lawmakers built into the new state budget and the governor’s further budget cutting. “I hope that for the people I work for there isn’t pronounced or prolonged hardship. That’s what I hope will be the case. I fear that people will experience some — they certainly are experiencing anxiety right now, that’s without question. I hope we’re able to work together as the House and Senate and the administration to do the best we can in these really, really difficult circumstances for the people we serve.”
The “Largest Tax Cut in History”
The White House promoted the bill the president signed on July 4 as a “once-in-a-generation piece of legislation that makes good on his campaign promises and puts America First.” The administration said the new law features the “largest tax cut in history for middle- and working-class Americans,” a permanent increase in the Child Tax Credit for more than 40 million families, a $12.5 billion outlay to modernize air traffic control across America, federal spending cuts that total $1.5 trillion, funding for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system, and more.
“President Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill delivers on the commonsense agenda that nearly 80 million Americans voted for – the largest middle-class tax cut in history, permanent border security, massive military funding, and restoring fiscal sanity,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The pro-growth policies within this historic legislation are going to fuel an economic boom like we’ve never seen before.”
The bill includes a handful of policy ideas that Trump made popular last year on the campaign trail. For example, most workers will be able to deduct the first $25,000 they earn in tips annually from their taxable income through 2028. Similarly, the first $12,500 that an individual earns in overtime pay will be eligible for a deduction through the 2028 tax year.
The Joint Committee on Taxation last week estimated that, for calendar year 2027, the largest tax cut by percentage will benefit people who earn between $15,000 and $30,000, a projected 27.1 percent tax cut that translates into about $3 billion saved. By dollar amount, people who make $200,000 to $500,000 stand to benefit the most, to the tune of $51.2 billion in total tax savings (which represents a 3.5 percent cut). 
From less than $15,000 to more than $1 million, every income bracket is expected to see a tax cut under the new law, the committee said. Across the board, taxpayers can expect to save a cumulative $179.8 billion (3.8 percent) in 2027.
Bay State Republicans have been far slower than their national counterparts to embrace the new law. Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr of Gloucester was not able to provide a comment on the bill Thursday when the US House sent it to Trump and told the News Service on Monday that he was still analyzing the legislation.
“There’s not a lot to say right now,” Tarr said. When asked if he expects the federal law to be a net positive to Massachusetts, he said, “Don’t know. Not sure. That’s why it doesn’t make sense to talk right now. When we know, we’ll be happy to talk.”
Jones gave the new law a mixed review. He said some of the tax code changes, like allowing tax deductions on tips in overtime pay, could be great for some Bay Staters, but voiced concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food aid.
“I put myself in the category of TBD,” Jones told the News Service. “Depending where you are situated, tax-wise, you know, maybe it’s a big upside, at least initially. But from what I read, most of the beneficial tax things — overtime and tips — are sunsetted, so you may get a false sense of, ‘Oh, wow. This is wonderful.’ Whereas some of the things that you think have more downside are maybe more permanent.”
“If you read a lot of reports, the gap between the bookends of worst-case [and] best-case can be pretty broad,” he added.

Others, including a cadre of GOP representatives who withheld their support for the bill until the final vote, have raised concerns about what the new law will mean for federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that its estimate is that the new law will increase federal deficits by $3.4 trillion between now and 2034. 
S&P Global Ratings said states and nonprofit health care providers “are affected by new Medicaid stipulations that standardize work requirements for recipients, reduce the provider tax, and introduce other programmatic changes that could financially pressure issuers in the longer term.” 
“On the positive side, modifications to some federal income tax provisions could benefit individuals in states with high tax burdens and potentially support employees in some industries,” S&P Global Ratings Chief Analytical Officer Nora Wittstruck said.
One of the more closely-watched policy sections of the federal legislation here was a proposed 10-year ban on state-level regulation of artificial intelligence, which was removed by the US Senate before the bill went to Trump. During an appearance on WCVB’s “On The Record” Sunday, Sen. Barry Finegold talked about the need for state and federal guardrails on the technology.
“I think people really don’t understand what regulating AI means. We want artificial intelligence to grow. It is an incredible technology and it’s going to do wonderful things. But just like social media early on, we didn’t really truly understand what this thing would become,” he said, agreeing with a host that state lawmakers “missed the boat” when social media first took off. “And I think to have proper guardrails around artificial intelligence is a good thing.”
The Andover Democrat said he’s been working with state senators from New York and California on AI issues but said the country “absolutely” needs comprehensive federal regulation of AI as well.
“We don’t want to have, you know, 50 different versions of an AI bill and 50 different regulations for each state. So should this happen on the federal level? It should. Is it happening? No. The same reason why we still don’t have a federal privacy bill,” Finegold said. “So that’s why states like ours, I believe, need to step up — not to fully regulate it, but to have proper guardrails so people don’t get hurt.”
Big Weekend For Budget Action
Gov. Maura Healey signed a $60.9 billion state budget on the same day Trump signed the federal megapackage into law.
The fiscal 2026 spending plan Healey approved has a few measures built into it to absorb some federal funding changes. She vetoed $130 million, lawmakers left a roughly $800 million cushion of projected but unappropriated revenues, and the budget also deploys a larger bucket of income surtax revenues.
Healey’s team will also wait to pay roughly $125 million in earmarks until at least the fall, at which point officials hope they will have a better sense of whether that spending is feasible.
Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said last week that his team has been examining the megabill’s impacts on Medicaid, the Massachusetts Health Connector, food aid, higher education and taxes.
Gorzkowicz said he expects to have a solid grasp on how those issue areas will affect state government and the state budget within about a month. The full impact of other provisions outside that shortlist might take longer to parse, he added.
The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation said in a report published Monday that Medicaid impacts to the state budget “could be close to $100 million” in fiscal 2026, which started July 1.
Still, the cavalcade of federal changes will not hit all at once, and the bigger impacts on the state budget might be more concentrated in subsequent fiscal years. 
Extension of many tax cuts will start this year and appear when Bay Staters file tax returns next year. Some clean energy tax credits will also end in the coming months. Reforms and restrictions on health insurance could start next year, Medicaid work requirements will not begin in most states until the end of 2026, and a major shift in federal funding toward Medicaid and food aid will not start until 2028, according to The New York Times. 
As the Times noted, the combined effect means many of the law’s tax benefits will arrive soon, while cuts will be delayed largely until after next year’s midterm elections.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A mining company released an initial assessment this week that outlines the potential for an open-pit gold mine northwest of Lead in South Dakota’s northern Black Hills.
According to Dakota Gold’s new report, its Richmond Hill project could produce between 2.6 million and 3.9 million ounces of gold over 17 to 28 years, based on an analysis of historic data from the previously mined area and 146 exploratory holes drilled in the past three years. 
The nearby Wharf Mine, operated by a different company, has produced about 3 million ounces of gold since 1982. The Homestake Mine, also nearby, produced more than 40 million ounces before it closed more than two decades ago.


Not accounting for taxes and production costs, Dakota Gold estimates the Richmond Hill mine could generate $6.1 billion to $8.7 billion worth of gold at current prices. Developing the mine would would require an estimated initial investment of $384 million.
The company expects to advance into production as soon as 2029, “firmly placing Dakota Gold as having one of the largest development gold assets in the U.S.,” said CEO Robert Quartermain in a news release. 
The company will need a large-scale mine permit from the state of South Dakota, and has already taken steps toward producing a socioeconomic study, an initial part of the permitting process. The Richmond Hill deposit sits mostly on previously mined, privately owned land, which Dakota Gold believes could streamline permitting.
The company estimates the mine could generate $400 million to $600 million in state severance taxes over its 17- to 28-year lifespan, and hundreds of jobs.
The project would be half a mile north of the Wharf Mine, which is the only operational, large-scale gold mine in the state, operated by Chicago-based Coeur Mining. The Wharf Mine is visible from the Terry Peak Ski Area.
Dakota Gold has offices in Lead and Canada. Richmond Hill is one of the company’s multiple exploratory projects in the Homestake mine region.

With the facility update, the release stated Muscatine Community College will offer a new computer numerically controlled machining program, alongside expanded welding education slots and labs and other spaces for high school students participating in a career academy.
The largest contribution to the renovation came in the form of $1 million from the State of Iowa Career Academy Incentive Fund grant, according to the release, followed by a $250,000 donation from Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust, $50,000 from HNI Charitable Foundation, $25,000 from the MCC Foundation and $10,000 from the Midwest One Foundation.
Individual donations to the project totaled $5,200, and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges matched $325,000 for local gifts.
“Our success is built on partnership,” DeWinter said in the release. “When the college identifies a need, we bring together our partners in government, business, and the community to make it happen. At the core of it all is student learning, which changes lives and builds communities.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wants the state to give the county monitoring authority over the new Everglades immigrant detention center.
The mayor cited in a Tuesday letter to the state’s top legal officer the county’s ownership of the land where the detention center is located as warranting remote video access, weekly reports, and scheduled site visits.
Gov. Ron DeSantis used his authority under a 2023 emergency declaration against illegal immigration to commandeer the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport and built the detention center in eight days.
“Given the critical environmental significance of this area and the deep-rooted commitment Miami-Dade has made to properly protecting and preserving our treasured Everglades, it is imperative that local authorities maintain clear transparency in all stages of their handling,” Levine Cava wrote.

Additionally, the mayor voiced deep and growing concern about the safety of people in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a separate Tuesday letter to Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year, three at the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, according to press releases from ICE.
“Detention centers like Krome and the newly opened facility in the Everglades have been placed in isolated areas with poor access to hospitals and legal counsel,” the mayor wrote.
The county received 32 calls regarding life-threatening conditions from the ICE detention center in Miami in June, Levine Cava wrote to Noem. In June 2024, there were five emergency calls.
Immigrant advocacy group wants legal action
Levine Cava’s letters come as she faces mounting criticism over the county’s response to the detention center, which the state is calling “Alligator Alcatraz,” where detainees started arriving Wednesday.
The Florida Immigrant Coalition paid for two billboards calling for Levine Cava and county officials to sue the state to stop the detention center.
“We feel that the mayor and the county commission are not just failing to protect the rights and wellbeing of the detainees and prospective detainees at the facility, which is obviously the most important thing, but they’re not also protecting the interest of Miami-Dade residents, who theoretically are the owners of this land,” said Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for FLIC.

But the county is in defense mode in a lawsuit from environmental groups, asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to halt activity at the detention center. Attorneys for the county responded to the suit from Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity on June 30 by stating that the court couldn’t force the county to take action against the state.
“State law affirmatively requires the County to use best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law, and the County’s failure to comply with that statutory duty could have dramatically adverse consequences for the public interest, including but not limited to the suspension from office of County officials elected by the voters of Miami-Dade County,” the response states.

Who’s allowed to visit?
While members of Congress can conduct oversight visits at federal immigration detention facilities, it’s not clear who will enjoy the same authority over the detention center in the Everglades. The Trump administration recently changed the policy governing Congressional visits to detention centers, requiring 72-hour notice, according to Axios.
Officers guarding the site denied entrance to a group of state Democratic lawmakers Thursday.
“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” wrote Democratic Sens. Carlos Guillermo Smith and Shevrin Jones and Reps. Michele Rayner, Angie Nixon, and Anna Eskamani in a press release Thursday.
A spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which is in charge of the detention center, wrote in an email to Florida Phoenix that the lawmakers were turned away because the center is not under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections, and that statute only allows visits for legislative committees.
“Florida Statutes grants inspection authority to a legislative committee, not to individual legislators engaging in political theater,” wrote Stephanie Hartman, FDEM’s deputy director of communications. “This distinction is crucial for ensuring that oversight is conducted through formal, established legislative processes.”
FDEM, DHS, and the attorney general’s office didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Levine Cava’s letters.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin system campuses will raise their undergraduate tuition by a maximum of 5% next year, under a plan UW President Jay Rothman announced Tuesday. 
The announcement comes just days after the state Legislature passed and Gov. Tony Evers signed a state budget that includes increased investments in the system by over $200 million for operational costs and over $800 million for capital projects. While the increases took a different direction from Republican’s proposed cuts, they are nowhere near the $855 million operational budget increase initially requested by the system last year when Rothman warned that tuition increases would be on the table if there wasn’t significant investment. 
Rothman said in a statement that the state’s universities have become dependent on tuition due to lagging state funding over many years, but the “turnaround” from proposed cuts to the state investing in the budget will help “preserve access and affordability” for students and families. 
“Preserving quality while maintaining our ability to be a leader on tuition affordability in the Midwest is a top priority,” Rothman said. “After a decade of a tuition freeze and lagging state aid, we believe we have struck a balance for students and families with this proposal and the recent state investments in the UWs as part of the 2025-27 biennial budget.”
Rothman will ask the UW Board of Regents to approve a 4% increase at all campuses for the 2025-26 year. 
Individual campuses would also have the option under his proposal of implementing an additional 1% increase. All universities except UW-Green Bay plan to adopt that. UW-River Falls is also seeking to increase its tuition even further by 5.8% to support “ student success initiatives.” 
Under the proposal, nonresident undergraduate tuition at each campus would increase by the same percentage or dollar amount. 
The system noted that most of the increases approved in the state budget are for specific purposes, including virtual mental health services, wage increases and addressing staff recruitment and retention. 
State funding today makes up about a fifth of the UW’s total revenue. The UW system’s 2023-25 biennial budget was $13.7 billion with 58% of that coming from program revenue, 24% from the federal government and 18% from general purpose revenue. 
In 1984-85, state general purpose revenue made up 41.8% of the UW System’s budget. 
According to the UW system, the average increase when segregated fees and room and board costs are included would be 3.8%. 
If approved, the increase will be the third consecutive year of tuition increases for UW since the end of a 10-year tuition freeze in 2023. The system said its tuition increased just 7.7% from 2015 to 2025, below the tuition increases for its peers in other states that had increases ranging from  21.7% to 28.8% over the 10 years.
The UW Board of Regents will consider the plan on July 10.
Here are the proposed resident undergraduate tuition costs for 2025-26 at each campus:

UW-Eau Claire: $10,067
UW-Green Bay: $8,985

June 28, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceThe sweeping and draconian cuts to Medicaid by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have left healthcare advocates around the country reeling. 
At a virtual press conference hosted Tuesday by the Protect MI Care coalition, policy experts, advocates, and stakeholders contextualized what changes in the recently enacted “big, beautiful” bill will mean for Michiganders. 
“By passing this bill, members of Congress have chosen to rip away healthcare from millions of Americans,” Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy said. “Hundreds of thousands of Michigan residents, including kids, seniors in nursing homes, people with disabilities, all stand to lose coverage, lose access to services, or face longer wait times because of these tax cuts.”
CEO of Michigan Health and Hospital Association Brian Peters explained that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that federal funding for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program will undergo a $1.02 trillion reduction by 2034. The budget office later clarified that this reduction stems from a revised enrollment estimate,  anticipating 79.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries by 2034 instead of the previously projected 90 million.
Peters went on to state that the effects of this legislation will be far-reaching as the reductions won’t just impact Medicaid beneficiaries; they’ll affect all patients.

Essentially, hospitals and healthcare providers rely on the federal funding disbursed through Medicaid to fund critical services and patient care. This is made possible by the Medicaid provider tax program, which allows states to maximize healthcare funding by levying taxes on providers instead of taxing citizens. 
Elizabeth Hertel, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that if 40% of a county’s residents are Medicaid beneficiaries, 40% of that hospital’s revenue comes from Medicaid.
“Our hospitals and our providers will face limiting services or closing locations, and healthcare workers will lose their jobs when a hospital or provider limits services or closes,” Hertel added. “They don’t stop seeing patients who have Medicaid. They stop seeing everybody who lives in or visits that community.”
For Michigan hospitals, Peters noted, that’s a loss of more than $6 billion in funding over the next decade. 
The future of Medicaid has effectively been shifted to individual states, many of which may have to begin either limiting Medicaid benefits, lowering the rates they pay providers, or stiffening eligibility requirements so that fewer people will qualify for coverage.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Hospitals typically work with three to five-year strategic plans, which means that, while these changes aren’t set to take effect immediately, healthcare providers must make crucial staffing and budgeting decisions sooner rather than later. 
State legislatures are likely to be in a similar position. To Peters, the potential for future disruption is a present call to action. 
“I think there’s the opportunity in the here and now, working with our state officials, our state lawmakers, and certainly at the federal level as well, to create new legislation, new policies that can help the provider community and the healthcare community,” Peters said. He went on to add that he looks forward to working with partners in the state government to mitigate the impact of this new legislation.

“We’ve been following up with them, and we’re going to continue to do so,” Morrisey said. “I’m going to get back to the office and launch another call there, because we’re going to push.”
Nine people from Ohio County died in flash flooding caused by heavy rain that began June 14. The flooding also caused an apartment building in Fairmont to collapse, displacing more than two dozen residents. 
Morrisey formally requested a federal disaster declaration for Marion and Ohio counties June 20, but Donald Trump’s administration has yet to grant the declaration. Disaster declarations allow affected areas assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, depending on the circumstances. 
Trump on Sunday approved a disaster declaration for the state of Texas, where flash floods killed at least 104 people last week. 
Morrisey’s comments were in response to a question from Ogden News reporter Steven Allen Adams after a press conference Tuesday at Yeager International Airport, in Charleston.

  A joint investigation by The Independent and MuckRock.
After years of mourning family and friends who succumbed to aggressive cancers, activists in Missouri finally won federal recognition that radiation released during the development of nuclear weapons is to blame.
Since the publication of a six-month investigation by The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has pressed for Missourians to be included among the states where residents are eligible for compensation. The provision extending help to the St. Louis region, where uranium was processed for the first atomic bombs, New Mexico, where the first bombs were produced and tested, and six other states, was finally included in the massive budget reconciliation bill signed Saturday by President Donald Trump.
“We blinked and after 13 years of being in the dark, we were in the sun,” Dawn Chapman, co-founder of Just Moms STL, said in an interview with The Independent.
Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

The passage was celebrated as a victory in a news conference in a St. Louis County park adjacent to Coldwater Creek, contaminated by radioactive waste since 1949.
Hawley and Chapman were joined by Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and activists from around the country to get the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act renewed and expanded. The law, originally passed in 1990, lapsed in 2024.
“It’s a tremendous privilege to be with these heroes who are beside me and behind me,” Hawley said as he opened the news conference.
The people who lived in the areas now eligible for compensation have waited far too long for help, Hawley said.
“The truth is, it wasn’t just the people of Missouri who had waited for 70 years to have justice done,” Hawley said. “It was the people of the Navajo Nation. It was the people of Utah, it was the people of New Mexico, it was the people of Idaho, it was the uranium miners and atomic veterans from all over the country who had been waiting for decades for the federal government to finally own up to what it had done.”
The Navajo Nation has suffered from fallout swept by winds onto its Arizona lands from nuclear weapons tests, Nygren said. More than 100 uranium mines were on reservation land and, in 1979, the Church Rock Spill, the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history, poured 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Puerco River.
“People were devastated because their livestock, their cattle, their land, their water resources were extremely affected,” Nygren said.
All of New Mexico’s downwinders could be compensated under Senate’s ‘big, beautiful bill’

Under the provisions included in the budget bill, Missourians who contracted one of 20 cancers, including lung or breast cancer, after living in any of 21 zip codes for at least two years are eligible for compensation. Leukemia is also covered, but only if it occurred at least 20 years after residence in the designated areas.
In addition to Missouri, the budget bill allows compensation for radiation exposure related to the Manhattan Project in 14 zip codes in Tennessee, two zip codes in Alaska and three in Kentucky. New Mexico is included among the states where fallout spreading downwind from atomic and nuclear tests contaminated the land. The downwind areas, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah in the original compensation act, now include New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho and Montana.
New Mexico delegation, radiation victims renew call for compensation

Missouri is also working to identify if other areas are contaminated.
During this year’s legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region. The measure, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has indicated he will sign Thursday, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land and removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation.
The celebration of the bill’s passage is clouded by the memories of people who died without compensation or acknowledgement that nuclear material caused their deaths, Chapman said at the news conference.
“The hard thing today, and why it’s so heavy, is there’s so many people that should be behind us, that have already passed on,” she said. “There’s many people from the Navajo nation that have passed on, that were part of this fight, that are not here to be recognized.Our government made it harder. They did everything they could to hide the truth from us.”
The compensation can cover medical costs for people who are still alive, or they can elect to receive a single payment of $50,000. Family members of people who died of one of the listed cancers are eligible for a one-time payment of $25,000, to be divided equally among the living heirs.
The compensation for people who lived downwind of nuclear tests or worked in uranium mining was increased to $100,000.
The money will help people pay for treatments and expenses not usually covered by insurance, Chapman said.
“When you look at this list of cancers, and you look at the cancers that people are getting in North County, they’re horribly aggressive,” she said. “And we have great hospitals and cancer centers here, but what we do not have is the ability for a mom who’s already used up all of her parental leave, her family medical leave, to take extra time off with her child.’
The new federal legislation sets the starting date for possible exposure at 1949, a key date uncovered in the joint investigation by The Independent and its reporting partners.
Giving The Independent access to the documents obtained through years of federal Freedom of Information Act requests was “one of the scariest, riskiest things that we did, and it is the thing that ended up paying off the most,” Chapman said. “It is the thing that launched RECA, when Sen. Hawley read the story and saw the documents that you guys put up.”
The documents showed that during the war, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium for the Manhattan Project, the name given to the effort to build the bomb, in downtown St. Louis. Uranium from the Mallinckrodt plant was used in the first sustained nuclear reaction in Chicago, a significant breakthrough.
An internal Mallinckrodt memo from 1949 shows the company was storing highly radioactive residue called K-65 in deteriorating steel drums at the St. Louis airport near Coldwater Creek. The material was so dangerous, the memo said, that Mallinckrodt couldn’t simply put it in new containers because “the hazards to the workers involved in such an occupation would be considerable.”
Efforts to find a buyer for the waste resulted in a sale in 1965, and within a few years, most of the waste was sold and moved just up the road to a site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood where it, again, sat exposed to the elements and adjacent to Coldwater Creek.
In early 2024, more than 70 years after workers first realized barrels of radioactive waste risked contaminating Coldwater Creek, the federal government put up signs warning residents. Cleaning up the creek carries a cost estimated at $400 million.
“We are here today in the very park that made me sick,” said Karen Nickel, a co-founder of Just Moms STL. “I grew up on that street right there, a place where I played as a child, never knowing the danger from radioactive atomic bomb waste.”
Nickel has lupus and other auto-immune diseases she believes were caused by the radiation but her illnesses are not covered in the compensation act expansion. She doesn’t regret the hard work, even if it won’t help her, she said.
“I feel like the little girl who got sick here didn’t suffer in vain,” Nickel said. “This moment is bittersweet. It’s victory wrapped in grief. But I also hope that no other community has to wait this long to be heard.” 
The waste was spread by efforts to remove it. After extracting valuable metals from the bomb waste, the buyer, Cotter Corp. initially received permission to use a pit at the Weldon Spring quarry in St. Charles County, which was already a disposal site for other radioactive waste.
After that decision was reversed over concerns that radiation was already leaking from the quarry, over a period of 2 ½ months in the summer and fall of 1973, Cotter took the problem into its own hands, without telling government regulators.
The company mixed the radioactive waste with tens of thousands of tons of contaminated soil from the site and illegally dumped it in a free, public landfill called West Lake, under three feet of soil and other garbage.
The landfill was declared a federal toxic Superfund site in 1990. In 2010, a subsurface smoldering event, similar to an underground fire, at the Bridgeton Landfill threatened the radioactive waste buried in the since-closed Westlake Landfill nearby. That fire sent noxious and hazardous fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. The company in charge of the Bridgeton Landfill now spends millions a year to contain it.
At the news conference, activists from across the country who lost family members told a part of their story and their fight for recognition and compensation.
Maggie Billiman, whose father Howard Billiman was a Navajo code talker in World War II, said her family lives downwind from where 100 nuclear weapons were tested. He died of stomach cancer in 2001.
“When we heard RECA was passed, we cried for happiness,” Billiman said.
Sherrie Hanna of Prescott, Arizona, said she lost both her husband and her father to cancer and received compensation under the act before it expired in 2024. She was worried it would not be renewed, Hanna said.
“For many of us downwinders, myself included, the question is not if we will receive a cancer diagnosis but when,” Hanna said.
To get the renewal and expansion passed, Hawley said he had to overcome resistance among Republicans to new federal spending and find legislation that had to pass to carry it.
“It happened because it’s justice,” Hawley said. “But there’s more to do.”

Danny Alvarez, state Sen. Jay Collins, Rep. Karen Pittman Gonzalez, and Rep. Michael Owen in Tampa on July 7, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)Hillsborough County Republican state lawmakers fielded questions from supporters regarding the increasing cost of living in Florida on Monday night as they held a recap of the just-concluded 2025 legislative session.
Sen. Jay Collins and Reps. Danny Alvarez, Karen Gonzalez Pittman, and Michael Owen fielded queries on a host of other topics as well, such as concerns about chemtrail sightings and alleged voting irregularities, during the hour-plus meeting in Tampa.
Other topics that have dominated the headlines from Tallahassee this year — from immigration to the enmity that developed between Gov. Ron DeSantis and fellow GOP member of the Florida House — went untouched during the proceeding.
Affordability remains front and center among Floridians, encapsulated by one Republican in the audience who asked what the lawmakers were doing on property insurance, property taxes, and auto insurance rates.
Regarding property insurance, Rep. Danny Alvarez described how just weeks after he was elected in 2022, he confronted the topic in Tallahassee.
“The very first vote I ever took was in a special session where I was told that if I voted on this bill, the insurance rates would go down and our crisis would stop,” he said. “That was partially true.”
That vote did stabilize reinsurance rates, Alvarez said, but “we weren’t told all the truth when we voted.”
That was a reference to a Tampa Bay Times report that emerged during this year’s session that insurers claiming financial ruin following Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Michael in 2018 had paid $680 million in dividends to shareholders while simultaneously funneling billions to affiliated companies.
“So, I voted on something without all the information,” he told the audience.
Subsequently, “for the first time in a long, long time” legislators began using their oversight authority in committee hearings, calling upon the sitting and former state insurance commissioners to testify about why they didn’t bring more attention to a 2022 report detailing money transfers from Florida insurers to out-of-state affiliates.
“I was told that people were dying on the vines and were going to run away from Florida, when in reality all they had done was shift their money to their secondary companies that were making billions of dollars while we suffer,” Alvarez said. “That was completely unfair, and we are righting that wrong.”
Lawmakers in the House did introduce a proposal (HB 881) this session that would have required property insurers to demonstrate that fees, commissions, and other payments to affiliates were fair and reasonable. But that measure died in committee.
Property taxes
Both Gonzalez Pittman and Owen are serving on the 37-member House Select Committee on Property Taxes. That’s the group slated to meet throughout the year to devise a strategy for how the state could wean itself off property taxes without suffering a major reduction in revenues. That work is expected to help inform lawmakers, who have already said that they intend to place a constitutional amendment on the 2026 statewide ballot to repeal property taxes.
Owen, a freshman lawmaker who previously served on the Hillsborough County Commission, said that although some counties don’t rely so much on property taxes to fund important services, others like Hillsborough essentially “run” through that revenue source. He dismissed some of the ideas that have already been proposed in the committee so far, but said he would not do anything that would essentially “defund the police.”
“What I’m saying is, we will have to come up with another solution to pay for our first responders if we are going to [remove] property taxes from Hillsborough County because it’s such a great percentage of what we use to pay our first responders,” he said. “I’m not saying that we can’t get it done. I’m saying that’s a heavy lift.”
Another member of the audience asked the lawmakers about escalating energy costs — the average energy bill went up by more than 50% between 2018 and 2023.
“What is your opinion on TECO and the never-ending increases that we’re all experiencing right now?” the Hillsborough Republicans were asked. “And why isn’t there any competition coming?”
The legislators had little substantive to say about the issue, with Alvarez noting that Florida public utilities can raise their rates only if approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC). He and Sen. Collins said a possible remedy to address the state’s growing energy needs could come from small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), listed in a feasibility report written by the PSC earlier this year. “It’s something that we should be at the very forefront of,” said Collins.
Alvarez acknowledged that such technology is “probably over 10 years away.”
Chemtrails
One audience member asked the four Republicans, “When will we stop seeing the chemtrails?” That was a reference to a bill banning weather-modification projects recently signed into law by Gov. DeSantis and that just went into effect last week.
Although such projects exist, what many people consider chemtrails are actually harmless “contrails” (for condensation) caused by freezing water vapor emitted by jet engines.
“People should be able to contact law enforcement and make sure that those flights do not take off and, if they are, when they land, they’re given a citation,” Gonzalez Pittman said.
The lawmakers stayed clear of opining too much when asked by another member of the audience about an allegation by a Republican congressional challenger to Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor of  “substantial” voting irregularities in their race last fall, which Castor won by more than 15 points. The questioner asked if they would look at “overturning this election.”
The Republicans bobbed and weaved regarding the question, with Collins ultimately pivoting to how strong voting integrity protections are in Florida and how DeSantis recruited him to run for the Legislature, and not Congress, which he originally intended to do in 2021.
He said the governor persuaded him to run in the Senate District 14 race (in which he defeated Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz by 10 points), promising, ‘”You’ll get more done in a year than you would in 20 years in Congress.'”
“And the man didn’t lie. He was 100% right,” Collins said.
Collins is considered a leading candidate to become the next lieutenant governor. DeSantis said last week he would make his long awaited appointments for both that position and for the chief financial officer seat “in relatively short order” following the July 4 holiday weekend.
Topics not on the agenda
Not discussed was the Hope Florida Foundation. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the nonprofit program initiated by Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis. In April, state lawmakers began investigating $10 million in “donations” it received from a Medicaid overpayment settlement.
Shortly after the legislative session broke in early May while lawmakers continued to work on the state budget, Gonzalez Pittman passed out a flow chart in a meeting with constituents showing where that flow of that money had moved around, ultimately landing with political committees that spent the money opposing the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis last year.
That display had angered the governor, who blasted the South Tampa lawmaker a week later during a Hope Florida event in Brandon, saying that she had “took propaganda that was done by far-left Democrats,” and adding that she had done a “poor job as the representative from South Tampa.”
The evening was marked by numerous references to how the Republicans now represented the “red” county of Hillsborough, whose shift to the right over the past five years has been echoed across Florida. Less than five years ago, county voters went for Joe Biden by more than six percentage points over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, while re-electing State Attorney Andrew Warren by more than six points.
Flash forward to last November, when Trump bested Kamala Harris by three points and Warren, running after being suspended for two years by DeSantis, fell short in his bid to recapture the state attorney’s office by more than five percentage points.

(Danielle Prokop, Source NM)New Mexico justices Tuesday morning denied Tesuque Village residents’ emergency petition in a dispute over a proposed sewage permit for a nearby resort and development.
Chief Justice David Thomson delivered the ruling from the bench after a short deliberation, saying the arguments made by residents failed to meet the bar for the high court to intervene in an emergency fashion. Thomson also allowed administrative hearings on the permit to resume. The court had previously paused them until they could hear arguments from the parties.
Earlier this year, the New Mexico Environment Department approved a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development in Tesuque to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.
Tensions have been building for the last year, as dozens of residents in the village of about 1,000 have opposed multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort. In April, attorneys for the nonprofit Protect Tesuque filed an emergency petition. In asking the high court to weigh in, Protect Tesuque claimed the state regulators’ permitting actions violated the state constitution and said the permit would threaten water quality downstream.
New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

Both NMED and owners of Bishop’s Lodge maintain the permitting process’ validity and both have said the treated wastewater quality exceeds state and federal standards. Both argued Protect Tesuque’s claims did not meet the threshold of an emergency, needlessly interrupted the permitting process and requested a lower standard of safety requirements.
The panel of five justices asked questions of all parties during the 50-minute hearing, but appeared skeptical regarding Protect Tesuque’s stance.
For instance, justices remarked that given that no final decision has yet been made regarding the permit, residents still have avenues to appeal in the administrative process, making emergency intervention by the state Supreme Court unnecessary.
Attorney Tom Hnasko, who represented Protect Tesuque, said he doesn’t know what comes next. “We’ll have to regroup,” he told Source NM after the hearing.
Rusty Day, a board member at Protect Tesuque, said after the hearing he was “disappointed at the delay,” and said the group would seek a potential appeal in the administrative process.
“They didn’t rule on the merits, so now we need to wait, months, if not years to get a dispositive ruling on the merits,” Day said.
Leadership at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge resort, issued a statement Tuesday saying they appreciated the court’s ruling.
“Bishop’s Lodge will continue using its state-of-the-art Membrane BioReactor wastewater treatment facility to fully treat effluent from the hotel and adjacent homes under the existing permit from the department,” said Chris Kaplan, the head of asset management, in a statement. “We continue to exercise good environmental stewardship and water conservation for the benefit of our guests, residents and the entire Tesuque Valley.”
State environment officials did not immediately respond to a request from Source NM on the next steps for the administrative hearings. This story will be updated as needed.

Samuel Corum/Getty Images (file photo)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year. 
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous VA performance improvements under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings. 
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide RIF is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA. 
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

Nashville had the fifth-highest reported gun theft rate in 2022, with 210 incidents per 100,000 residents. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)This story originally appeared on Stateline. 
A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Dugan has been indicted on charges that she helped an immigrant without legal status who came to her courtroom for a hearing on a misdemeanor charge evade federal immigration authorities. 
Dugan was arrested in April and indicted in May. She’s pleaded not guilty to charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. 
The case has become an example of the Trump administration’s effort to punish judicial interference with its escalation of immigration enforcement. In April, 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz was in Dugan’s courtroom when federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest him. 
Prosecutors say Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz out a side doorway to avoid arrest but the doorway Dugan led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney use led to the same hallway in which the agents were waiting and one took the elevator down with them. Flores-Ruiz was arrested on the street outside. 
In May, Dugan had filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her, arguing she is immune from prosecution because she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and that the arrest violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty as a state by disrupting a state court hearing and prosecuting a state judge. 
On Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. The final decision on dismissal is up to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who does not need to follow Joseph’s recommendation. 
“We are disappointed in the magistrate judge’s non-binding recommendation, and we will appeal it,” Dugan attorney Steven Biskupic, a former federal prosecutor, said in a statement. “This is only one step in what we expect will be a long journey to preserve the independence and integrity of our courts.”
In her recommendation, Joseph wrote that judicial immunity applies when a judge is being sued for civil damages, not criminal charges. 
“A judge’s actions, even when done in her official capacity, does not bar criminal prosecution if the actions were done in violation of the criminal law,” she wrote.

In her role, Navarrete Villegas will build relationships with Hartford residents and institutions, crowdsource questions on anything from city events to school enrollment to Medicaid, then research answers and push that information out via text, social media and events.
She will also write about what’s working in Hartford’s communities, and she will seek out information and story tips to bring back to the CT Mirror newsroom.
The goal of the Raising Voices Lab is to understand and meet the information needs of communities of color and to shine a light on stories that have been historically absent from dominant narratives about underrepresented communities. Navarrete Villegas will join Reginald David, who is CT Mirror’s community engagement reporter for Bridgeport.
Originally from Mexico, Navarrete Villegas has also lived in Panama. She previously served as the community engagement and video assistant at Epicenter NYC, a nonprofit newsroom that connects community members to news and practical information. She has also served as a podcast intern at The Take, Al Jazeera English’s daily news podcast.
“We’re excited to have Mariana join CT Mirror to report on the capital city of Hartford,” said Enterprise Editor Keila Torres Ocasio. “Her experience in community engagement and understanding of how people share and consume news in underserved communities make her a great addition to the team.”
Navarrete Villegas holds a B.A. in global studies with a minor in psychology from Saint Leo University in Florida and a master’s degree in bilingual journalism from the City University of New York’s Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
Her first day at CT Mirror was Monday.
CT Mirror’s Manager of Membership Irene Mackey chatted with Navarrete Villegas about her plans for her new role. Their conversation is below:
CT Mirror: What drew you to CT Mirror and the role of Community Engagement Reporter?
Navarrete Villegas: What drew me to CT Mirror was its commitment to in-depth, transparent policy reporting that not only informs readers but also holds the government accountable. As a bilingual journalist passionate about bottom-up journalism, I was excited by the opportunity to connect directly with Hartford communities through engagement-driven reporting that centers voices often left out of mainstream coverage.
CT Mirror: Hartford, like many cities, has communities that feel overlooked or misrepresented by traditional media. How will you build relationships with residents and earn their trust as a new voice in local journalism?
Navarrete Villegas: I will build relationships with residents and earn their trust by being present in the third spaces they gather at, by providing resources whenever they need them and by explaining when and how policies affect their everyday lives. I believe trust is built through consistency, listening without judgment and showing up even when there’s no story to file. For me, it’s important that through the relationships we build, they see me not just as a reporter, but as Mariana.
CT Mirror: Community focused journalism often blends reporting with resource-sharing. How will you determine when a story should answer a question, surface a systemic issue, or guide the reader toward action?
Navarrete Villegas: I will determine when a story should inform, reveal, or guide by listening with no assumptions, closely to the communities’ concerns, identifying gaps in access to information, and assessing what’s most useful at the moment. 
CT Mirror: CT Mirror has historically focused on state policy. How do you plan to connect city-specific concerns to broader state policy issues?
Navarrete Villegas: State policy affects the daily lives of people at a local level. Hence, I plan to connect city-specific concerns by identifying how local challenges, like housing, health care, or education, are shaped by decisions made in the Capitol. By grounding policy reporting in residents’ lived experiences, I can help bridge the gap between legislation and everyday impact.
CT Mirror: What are you most excited to learn or experience as you embed yourself in Hartford’s neighborhoods?
Navarrete Villegas: I’m most excited to learn about how communities in Hartford build systems of care for one another and how they stay connected across generations and neighborhoods. I’m also eager to experience their artistic expressions and the foods that bring people together.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mariana-Navarrete39-copy-1024x1024.png,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

This excerpt, which Reardon wrote in 2023 on the anniversary of the 2008 presidential debate hosted at Ole Miss, recalls a rare moment of relative political harmony. 

Fifteen years ago yesterday, I was thinking, “What the hell have I gotten myself into?”
It had started months earlier when Chancellor (Robert) Khayat, Vice Chancellor Gloria Kellum and Provost Carolyn Staton assigned me to work with student leaders to plan student activities to go along with the 2008 presidential debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. My friend, Dr. Andy Mullins, had worked arduously to make sure that Ole Miss would put on a first-class affair. I recruited Jennifer Taylor, director of student programming, and her assistant, Bradley Baker, to assist with the students. We were lucky to have Dave Brooks, a production consultant from Cleveland, Ohio, advise and assist us. We couldn’t have done it without him.
I remember distinctly our first meeting with the students when all kinds of ideas were being tossed around. Our student group represented a cross section of the Ole Miss campus, and they were lively and creative. Eventually, they decided to host a week-long series of events and cap it off with a “festival” in The Grove on the day of the debate. 
I also remember sitting in a meeting in the Lyceum boardroom around what has to be the longest table in north Mississippi with administrators, PR folks, maintenance and landscape crews, communication and tech folks, law enforcement leaders and others responsible for assuring that Ole Miss put on a first-class event. When it came my time to give a report on the student events, I said, “Well, the students are planning a festival in The Grove with music and food and speakers.” After Dr. Kellum and Provost Staton looked at me with a “Have you lost your mind?” gaze, I went on to report what the students were planning. I’m sure that most around the table were envisioning a football Saturday with copious amounts of alcohol, blue blazers, chandeliers, fried chicken and fisticuffs. I wish that I could remember all the outstanding students who worked so hard to make the festival happen. Students like Caleb Herod, Anna Rogers, Sarah Rogers, Jake McGraw, Tyler Craft, Tyler Rose Clemons, Kent Ford and others put together a great plan. The event would be an effort to draw attention to the importance of voting and the importance of having free and open dialogue about the election. The students planned for music, food, high-tech displays, voter registration, and providing a forum for dialogue. And, having fun on a day without classes.
We ended up with a strong line-up of music with the North Mississippi All Stars, Josh Kelley, Paul Thorn, Saving Abel, the Mayhem String Band, the Kudzu Kings and the Ole Miss Gospel Choir. I recruited my former student Ben Campbell, award-winning radio disc jockey from KNIX in Phoenix, to emcee. He was funny as always and even revived his imitation of me doing Tone Loc. We started at noon with an amazing acapella solo rendition of the national anthem by a member of the Ole Miss Gospel Choir, and when they finished their set with “O, Happy Day,” I was feeling pretty good about things and thinking, “Wow. This is gonna be good.”

My friend and food expert extraordinaire John T Edge helped us bring to The Grove some of the South’s all-star foodies. We had Newk’s with pimento cheese and caramel cake and sweet tea, Taylor Grocery with fried catfish plates, Jim and Nick’s of Birmingham with barbecue, Taqueria del Sol of Atlanta with tacos and Chef John Folse and Company out of New Orleans with a variety of Cajun dishes. The food was outstanding, but we ran into one little problem. The state of Mississippi Tax Commission showed up about 20 minutes before serving was to begin and demanded that all these businesses provide tax IDs or they wouldn’t be able to serve. Evidently, some uninvited entity had their feelings hurt and reported us to the tax commission. I was riding around in a golf cart with Mississippi’s treasured cartoonist Marshall Ramsey when I got a call about the situation. John T and I tried everything we could think of to get the tax deputies to allow us to go on with the event. I ended up reaching out to Gloria Kellum, asking for her help in getting in touch with “someone in charge.” As it turned out, she was right beside Gov. Haley Barbour at the time. After a quick chat with him, she told me to hold on — help was on the way.
About 10 minutes later the governor’s chief of staff showed up, and I watched from a distance as he had a quick conversation with the tax deputies. Only he spoke as they listened and soon walked away. He looked at us, gave us a thumbs up and lunch was served. We had permission to proceed. It helps to know someone who knows someone. Catfish, tacos, pimento cheese, sweet tea, caramel cake, barbecue, gumbo and jambalaya for all!
I was unsure how the tech displays would be received. Boy, was I surprised when there were long lines all day for the mobile buses and booths from Dell, FedEx, Apple, Cellular South (C Spire) and Microsoft. There were virtual reality displays, new technology, video games and lots of other neat stuff that was well beyond this digital immigrant’s understanding.
The Rock the Vote tent for voter registration was busy all day. They had become a great, valued partner in sponsoring the festival and were excited about the number of students who registered to vote that day.
There were also speakers, most who were stumping for a candidate or for themselves. There were personalities everywhere. Harry Smith did CBS’s The Early Show from the union early that morning. Chris Matthews set up Hardball on the Union Plaza. Katie Couric was everywhere and dropped by the Tri Delt house to visit her sorority. Sean Hannity set up in the union. It was a big day for Ole Miss to be seen by the nation and the world.
What gave the whole affair legitimacy was a concept that the students came up with called “Issue Alley.” Along the sidewalk that leads into The Grove from Farley Hall were designated spaces where groups with agendas could set up. This turned out to be a huge success. The lion lay down with the lamb. The NRA set up next to pro-choice groups. We had the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians setting up next to Rednecks for Obama. We had windmills promoting clean energy. All in all, we had about 30 organizations and associations represented. No one hit anyone or called each other names.
Around 5:30, I got a call to let me know that there was a ticket to the debate available for me if I wanted it. I chose to pass. I was where I wanted to be.
As The Grove darkened and the North Mississippi All Stars rocked their last song, two large screens on either side of The Grove came to life with the logo of the presidential debate. I’m no Sean Spicer, but I’m estimating that there were approximately eight to ten thousand in The Grove that night watching the debate. I pulled my golf cart well behind the crowd and watched from afar. There was a diverse crowd mixed with town folks, families, students and visitors. I don’t remember any booing or arguing or demonstrating. 
That day in The Grove there were no fights; there was no shouting. No one called anyone names. There were those on the Left and those on the Right, but they were sitting next to and across from one another eating fried catfish or gumbo and drinking sweet tea. We provided news outlets a beautiful, positive Ole Miss backdrop for their reporting. There were White folks and Black folks and folks from far away. There were young folks and old folks. There were no arrests. And, as the debate wound down and as PBS NewsHour host and debate moderator Jim Lehrer said, “And good night from Ole Miss,” I thought to myself that this is the way it is supposed to be.
It’s hard to believe that just 10 years ago might be considered “the good old days,” but they were. 
And that was the best day that I ever had at Ole Miss.

Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, park dispatch received multiple satellite SOS reports stating that individuals had fallen into Avalanche Creek, and CPR was being performed on two of the individuals.
A group of four visitors from Florida were gathering for a photo on the rocks above Avalanche Gorge when one individual slipped and fell into the water, and a second and third person trying to help also fell in.
Two of the individuals were swept through the gorge while one was able to grab ahold of tree branches in the gorge, waiting for help, the release said.
Rangers who responded found both individuals who had been swept through the gorge to be responsive, as bystanders performing CPR were successful in resuscitating them. It wasn’t immediately clear how the individuals were removed from the creek or the number of bystanders on scene who came to their aid.
The first ranger on scene was informed of the individual who was trapped in the gorge. The ranger was able to rappel to the individual and secure them while the technical rescue team was assembled and retrieved both the individual and the ranger.
All patients were transported to Logan Health in Kalispell, the park said. One patient was transported by ALERT, the second patient by Three Rivers Ambulance, and the third patient by Whitefish Ambulance.
All members involved are in stable condition, according to the release.
Drowning is the number one cause of death in Glacier National Park, according to park officials, and visitors are reminded to watch their surroundings near water.
“Swift, cold glacial streams and rivers, slick rocks or slippery logs all present dangers. Never walk, play, or climb on slippery rocks and logs, especially around waterfalls,” the news release warned.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)An appeals court will not reconsider its decision finding that the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens lack standing to bring a voting discrimination case against the state of North Dakota, a ruling that could impact the makeup of the state Legislature.
The Native American Rights Fund, one of the legal groups representing the plaintiffs in the case, in a statement called the decision “a loss for Native American voters in North Dakota.”
The plaintiffs could still file a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.
In the lawsuit, filed in 2022, two North Dakota tribes and three Indigenous North Dakotans argued that a redistricting plan adopted by the state in 2021 diluted the power of Native voters, thereby violating the Voting Rights Act. 
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to adopt a different map.
In a 2-1 decision in May, a panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that finding on the basis that private parties cannot bring lawsuits alleging racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act.
The plaintiffs requested that the case go before all 11 judges on the 8th Circuit for a rehearing, noting that the panel’s decision is at odds with how other federal appellate circuits have interpreted the law.
A total of 19 state attorneys general, a handful of advocacy groups and former Department of Justice attorneys filed briefs in support of an en banc hearing. 
North Dakota opposed the rehearing request. While they didn’t file anything on the en banc petition, 15 other Republican-led states had previously submitted briefs to the 8th Circuit in support of North Dakota’s position.
North Dakota tribes ask circuit judges for rehearing of voting rights case

The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.
It’s the only circuit to rule that private individuals cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices. The court in a 2023 ruling in a separate case declared that it is the role of the U.S. attorney general to enforce compliance with Section 2.
In the North Dakota lawsuit, the plaintiffs had attempted to use a separate civil rights law as a vehicle to file their Voting Rights Act claim. That law, Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code, says people may sue for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities” granted by the Constitution and federal law.
They noted in briefs that for decades, the bulk of lawsuits enforcing Section 2 have been brought by private individuals. The plaintiffs reasoned that even if the court found that they can’t bring a lawsuit directly under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, they still have a right to file their lawsuit through Section 1983. 
The 8th Circuit panel in its May ruling said this was not a viable path either.
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first – a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street previously said in a statement about the ruling. “This decision threatens that progress and weakens our voice in state government.”
Last week, the full 8th Circuit decided 7-3 not to give the case another look. The three judges who wanted an en banc hearing were Chief Judge Steven Colloton, former Chief Judge Lavenski Smith and Judge Jane Kelly. One judge didn’t participate in the decision.
In 2024, after Welte’s ruling, three Native American lawmakers were elected to the state Legislature from District 9, drawn to include two reservations: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats.
Brown is a freshman lawmaker. Marcellais had previously served 15 years in the statehouse until he lost his bid for reelection in 2022, after district lines were redrawn in 2021. Davis was first elected in 2022, then reelected last year. 
The 8th Circuit did not weigh in on the underlying question of whether North Dakota’s original 2021 map is discriminatory; it only found that the plaintiffs do not have the right to file the suit in the first place. The May opinion indicated the appellate court would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit. 
The state is still waiting to see what, if anything, will happen next in the case. The plaintiffs have about a three-month window to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lawsuit if they choose. They have not announced whether they intend to go that route.
If the 8th Circuit’s decision takes effect, North Dakota would revert back to the 2021 map. Three state lawmakers would represent different districts in that scenario. Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9.
The state would have to decide whether the ruling disqualifies those lawmakers from finishing out their terms, according to a June memo from Legislative Council.
Traditionally, when redistricting has shifted state lawmakers into different legislative districts, they have been allowed to serve until the next election cycle, the memo states. However, under the state constitution, state lawmakers are forbidden to live outside the district they represent.
All three lawmakers who would change districts are up for reelection in 2026.

On Monday, the KCC unanimously approved the company's plan to build new natural gas and solar plants. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas Corporation Commission gave Evergy the go-ahead to build two natural gas plants and a new solar plant, over the objections of multiple parties.
Evergy Kansas Central customers will see bills increase about 8.6% to build the new plants, KCC filings said.
EKC, the subsidiary of Evergy Inc. that serves Kansas customers, will be 50% co-owner of the two 710-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plants and 100% owner of the Kansas Sky solar facility, to be built in Douglas County. The Viola gas plant will be built in Sumner County, and the McNew gas plant will be in Reno County.
Cost of construction is estimated to be $788.75 million for the Viola plant and $800.52 million for the McNew plant, according to EKC’s filings. The solar field is expected to cost $228.1 million.
The other half of the two natural gas plants will be owned by Evergy Missouri West, but only if the Missouri Public Service Commission — KCC’s Missouri counterpart — approves the construction.
The Missouri commission’s staff has recommended against pre-construction approval because too many costs in the proposal were uncertain, according to Missouri Public Service Commission filings.


Work in progress
The unanimous decision from Kansas’ regulatory commission Monday afternoon to approve building two natural gas plants and a solar field was the first time in 15 years the KCC has been asked to do a pre-determination docket, said Brian Fedotin, KCC counsel.
In a pre-determination docket, Evergy seeks KCC approval before beginning construction. The company can then use a construction work-in-progress rate mechanism, called a CWIP,  approved by the Kansas Legislature in 2024, according to the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board. The CWIP lets companies begin charging customers for new infrastructure projects while they are under construction, rather than waiting until the next rate case to recover costs.
In Kansas, utility companies typically invest in infrastructure or other initiatives and then add the costs of those projects during a rate case that occurs after the projects are completed. The CWIP allows the company to collect dollars to fund projects as they are built, and it can be added to customer bills one year after construction begins. 

 
Rate concerns
The decision to build the natural gas plants was opposed by the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, industrial consumers and environmental groups, among others. In general, most agreed with building the solar plant, according to documents filed at KCC.
Commissioners also made note of their concerns about Evergy rates.
“The commission is concerned and troubled by the frequency and magnitude of rate cases, and strongly encourages Evergy to focus on pacing its proposed investments to better align those investments with actual load growth and the mitigation of large rate increases,” said Commissioner Dwight Keen at Monday’s virtual hearing.
Keen said that while the commission approves the addition of generation capabilities to meet the needs of Kansans and ensure stability of the power grid, they remain concerned about rate increases. Evergy currently has a separate rate case at KCC, asking for as much as a 15% hike to residential rates, which would be on top of the increase from building the plants.
Evergy last received a $41 million rate hike in 2023.
“The commission understands that from time to time, new investment in electric capacity is needed to support reliability and economic development in Kansas,” he said. “However, affordability and genuine maximum capacity needs must be major priorities and proactively pursued as Evergy addresses a seemingly endless list of ostensibly justifiable projects and initiatives.”
His words were matched by opponents to building the natural gas plants.
 
Opponents
Jim Zakoura, president of the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group, said Evergy has enough generation to meet electricity demand if current electricity systems, such as coal plants, are not retired before the end of their useful manufacturing life.
“Evergy’s plans to retire coal facilities early, while those facilities continue to provide electric service at costs which are far lower than new gas-fired generation, is not related to increased electric demand,” Zakoura said in a statement. “It is simply trading low-cost generation for high-cost generation to serve the same level of demand. Retail ratepayers get no greater value for their money — only higher prices.”
KCC staff and commissioners don’t agree.
“The oldest of the Jeffries units was commissioned in 1978 and will be over 50 years old if the proposed Viola combined cycle gas generation plant comes online in 2029,” Keen said. “It is impossible to know the exact timing of when coal units will retire. Load growth may require their lifespan to be extended, or environmental policy changes or technological advances may shorten their lives.”
Keen said an October 2022 fire at the Jeffrey Energy Center in Pottawatomie County caused that unit to be out of service for more than a year.
Officials with the Sierra Club, which testified in the Missouri Public Service Commission case for Evergy’s proposed plants and not in the Kansas case, said ratepayers are being asked to take on costs and subsidize a billion-dollar industry.
“Governor Kelly and KCC Commissioners supported and approved these gas plants, and now they have the opportunity to ensure that utilities and data centers pay their fair share, because the alleged new demand for electricity is from data centers, not Kansas families or existing businesses,” said Zack Pistora, director of the Kansas chapter.
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, expressed concerns that natural gas prices are difficult to predict.
“I am really worried that we are going to push ourselves into a really risky position with fossil fuels,” she said. “I obviously am concerned about the climate impacts of adding fossil fuels, right? But secondarily, gas prices are so volatile. We saw that with Winter Storm Uri. It’s supply and demand.”
Winter Storm Uri brought arctic weather to the Midwest in February 2021, resulting in increased utility prices for most customers after natural gas prices shot high because of production problems and high usage.
Costs of natural gas are a “straight pass-through” from the utilities, she said. She referred to Empire District Electric, which in 2007 served southeast Kansas.
“They were heavily invested in gas and people couldn’t pay their bills,” Barnett said. “They were one of the first utilities that began to invest in wind in Kansas. It wasn’t because they cared about the environment or cared about clean energy. It was because they were trying to diversify their fuel mix so that they weren’t reliant on gas.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said in a statement the company is pleased with KCC’s approval to help ensure system reliability.
“Kansas and Missouri are experiencing record economic growth, and today’s predetermination order affirms that the plants are needed to serve customers and are an efficient way to meet the growing demand,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KCC-commission-2-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-08 15:07:42.807883

(IPBS logo)Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations will be eliminating its entire statewide team of reporters and editors at the end of the year after the Indiana General Assembly defunded the organization.
“This is an incredibly difficult decision, but with the loss of state funding, individual stations have to make some very difficult decisions to address funding shortfalls and are focused on sustaining services to their local communities,” said Mark Newman, the executive director of Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations, Inc.
IPBS is a non-profit consortium of 17 public radio and television stations established in 1979. IPBS and its member stations are partners on education initiatives, civic affairs programming and public safety projects.
Indiana lawmakers in April cut the program’s $3.675 million annual funding after a lower-than-expected revenue forecast. Other programs were trimmed, but IPBS lost its entire line item.
Shortly after, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that cut all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and member stations, alleging “bias” in the organizations’ reporting.
Outside of public dollars, stations largely rely on donations and grants.

IPBS posted a statement Tuesday with few details.
“Amid the loss of state funding and the threat of potential federal funding cuts, the Indiana’s public broadcasting stations have proposed strategic changes and reductions for the IPB News statewide reporting collaboration,” the post said.
According to IPBS, its 17 member stations serve 95% of Hoosiers, delivering critical public safety information at no charge to Indiana residents. Such local broadcasting was crucial during flooding in North Carolina when residents didn’t have access to power, with hosts using their stations to connect residents to resources.
“The state funding cuts are being felt for real. This is the impact on public services that Hoosiers depend on and care about. It’s a quality of life matter and a necessity of life matter. That’s the hand we’ve been dealt,” Newman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
He said the organization’s focus will be to maintain their “core services,” or local content in Indiana communities.
“This is a transformative time. This is an opportunity to figure out a way to do this better, more effectively and with more impact. Focusing on how our stations operate and what we do. We intend to be here the next fifty years,” Newman said.
“Individual stations will continue to collaborate on statewide reporting relying on the deep community knowledge and on-the-ground work of local reporters who live in, listen to, and report for their own communities. This proposed approach and reorganization to the IPB News statewide reporting collaboration is an immediate consequence of state funding cuts. Specifics of the plan will be released in the near future,” the post concluded.
Indiana Public Broadcasting has an eight-person statewide team that includes education, labor, health, Statehouse and energy and environment editors and reporters.
Some recent stories include: a feature on the Indiana Court of Appeals’ program taking arguments on the road; Gov. Mike Braun celebrating improved coordination to enforce anti-abortion laws; reaction to Indiana University degree cuts; detailing a Medicaid beneficiary panel; sharing results from a youth tobacco study; and highlighting a citizenship ceremony.
Brandon Smith has covered the Statehouse for more than a decade and co-hosts Indiana Week in Review on WFYI. Other impacted reporters include: health reporter Abigail Ruhman; energy and environmental reporter Rebecca Thiele; digital editor Lauren Chapman; and labor and employment reporter Timoria Cunningham.

The law, signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in June, will require battery manufacturers to create a state-approved plan for battery disposal and recycling that includes free, drop-off locations across Connecticut. It will cover single-use batteries, rechargeables, those found in laptops, e-bikes, scooters and more.
The law goes into effect in October, but gives manufacturers until 2027 to get the collection programs up and running.
The new battery recycling program is Connecticut’s latest crack at something called “extended producer responsibility” or EPR. Similar EPR programs already exist in the state for paint and mattresses. The idea is that manufacturers bear responsibility for a product’s environmental impact beyond its point of sale.
Right now in Connecticut, the burden of recycling batteries is left up to cities and towns. And it can be an expensive proposition, said Jennifer Heaton-Jones, executive director of the Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority.
Currently, her group organizes battery drop-offs in western Connecticut.
“A hazardous waste event for us, on average, is about $50,000 for one day,” she said.
There’s the cost of collecting batteries, shipping them to a recycling facility and even telling people where to go, she said.
“Municipalities lack the resources, the financial resources, to be able to reach every resident when it comes to recycling in general and then to be able to educate a resident on a very specific item like batteries,” Heaton-Jones said.
The law could also reduce the risk of fire for trash collectors, by increasing the options for proper battery disposal. In May, a sanitation worker in North Haven suffered minor injuries when a lithium ion battery exploded during compacting, causing the garbage truck to catch on fire.
“We need an immense amount of water to be able to contain the battery,” said Fire Chief Paul Januszewski.
“It’ll emit a tremendous amount of smoke, heat and flames and you will not be able to put it out with a common fire extinguisher,” he said.
Battery manufacturers will have the next year to come up with a collection and recycling plan.
Until then, you can find your nearest battery drop off location by going to Call2Recycle.org

After years of mourning family and friends who succumbed to aggressive cancers, activists in Missouri finally won federal recognition that radiation released during the development of nuclear weapons is to blame.
Since the publication of a six-month investigation by The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has pressed for Missourians to be included among the states where residents are eligible for compensation. The provision extending help to the St. Louis region, where uranium was processed for the first atomic bombs, New Mexico, where the first bombs were produced and tested, and six other states, was finally included in the massive budget reconciliation bill signed Saturday by President Donald Trump.
“We blinked and after 13 years of being in the dark, we were in the sun,” Dawn Chapman, co-founder of Just Moms STL, said in an interview with The Independent.
Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

The passage was celebrated as a victory in a news conference in a St. Louis County park adjacent to Coldwater Creek, contaminated by radioactive waste since 1949.
Hawley and Chapman were joined by Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and activists from around the country to get the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act renewed and expanded. The law, originally passed in 1990, lapsed in 2024.
“It’s a tremendous privilege to be with these heroes who are beside me and behind me,” Hawley said as he opened the news conference.
The people who lived in the areas now eligible for compensation have waited far too long for help, Hawley said.
“The truth is, it wasn’t just the people of Missouri who had waited for 70 years to have justice done,” Hawley said. “It was the people of the Navajo Nation. It was the people of Utah, it was the people of New Mexico, it was the people of Idaho, it was the uranium miners and atomic veterans from all over the country who had been waiting for decades for the federal government to finally own up to what it had done.”
The Navajo Nation has suffered from fallout swept by winds onto its Arizona lands from nuclear weapons tests, Nygren said. More than 100 uranium mines were on reservation land and, in 1979, the Church Rock Spill, the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history, poured 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Puerco River.
“People were devastated because their livestock, their cattle, their land, their water resources were extremely affected,” Nygren said.
Under the provisions included in the budget bill, Missourians who contracted one of 20 cancers, including lung or breast cancer, after living in any of 21 zip codes for at least two years are eligible for compensation. Leukemia is also covered, but only if it occurred at least 20 years after residence in the designated areas.
In addition to Missouri, the budget bill allows compensation for radiation exposure related to the Manhattan Project in 14 zip codes in Tennessee, two zip codes in Alaska and three in Kentucky. New Mexico is included among the states where fallout spreading downwind from atomic and nuclear tests contaminated the land. The downwind areas, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah in the original compensation act, now include New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho and Montana.
Missouri is also working to identify if other areas are contaminated. 
During this year’s legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region. The measure, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has indicated he will sign Thursday, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land and removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation.

The celebration of the bill’s passage is clouded by the memories of people who died without compensation or acknowledgement that nuclear material caused their deaths, Chapman said at the news conference.
“The hard thing today, and why it’s so heavy, is there’s so many people that should be behind us, that have already passed on,” she said. “There’s many people from the Navajo nation that have passed on, that were part of this fight, that are not here to be recognized.Our government made it harder. They did everything they could to hide the truth from us.”
The compensation can cover medical costs for people who are still alive, or they can elect to receive a single payment of $50,000. Family members of people who died of one of the listed cancers are eligible for a one-time payment of $25,000, to be divided equally among the living heirs.
The compensation for people who lived downwind of nuclear tests or worked in uranium mining was increased to $100,000. 
The money will help people pay for treatments and expenses not usually covered by insurance, Chapman said. 
“When you look at this list of cancers, and you look at the cancers that people are getting in North County, they’re horribly aggressive,” she said. “And we have great hospitals and cancer centers here, but what we do not have is the ability for a mom who’s already used up all of her parental leave, her family medical leave, to take extra time off with her child.’
The new federal legislation sets the starting date for possible exposure at 1949, a key date uncovered in the joint investigation by The Independent and its reporting partners.
Giving The Independent access to the documents obtained through years of federal Freedom of Information Act requests was “one of the scariest, riskiest things that we did, and it is the thing that ended up paying off the most,” Chapman said. “It is the thing that launched RECA, when Sen. Hawley read the story and saw the documents that you guys put up.”
  A photo taken in 1960 of deteriorating steel drums containing radioactive residues near Coldwater Creek, by the Mallinckrodt-St. Louis Sites Task Force Working Group (State Historical Society of Missouri, Kay Drey Mallinckrodt Collection, 1943-2006).
The documents showed that during the war, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium for the Manhattan Project, the name given to the effort to build the bomb, in downtown St. Louis. Uranium from the Mallinckrodt plant was used in the first sustained nuclear reaction in Chicago, a significant breakthrough.
An internal Mallinckrodt memo from 1949 shows the company was storing highly radioactive residue called K-65 in deteriorating steel drums at the St. Louis airport near Coldwater Creek. The material was so dangerous, the memo said, that Mallinckrodt couldn’t simply put it in new containers because “the hazards to the workers involved in such an occupation would be considerable.”
Efforts to find a buyer for the waste resulted in a sale in 1965, and within a few years, most of the waste was sold and moved just up the road to a site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood where it, again, sat exposed to the elements and adjacent to Coldwater Creek.
In early 2024, more than 70 years after workers first realized barrels of radioactive waste risked contaminating Coldwater Creek, the federal government put up signs warning residents. Cleaning up the creek carries a cost estimated at $400 million.
“We are here today in the very park that made me sick,” said Karen Nickel, a co-founder of Just Moms STL. “I grew up on that street right there, a place where I played as a child, never knowing the danger from radioactive atomic bomb waste.”
Nickel has lupus and other auto-immune diseases she believes were caused by the radiation but her illnesses are not covered in the compensation act expansion. She doesn’t regret the hard work, even if it won’t help her, she said.
“I feel like the little girl who got sick here didn’t suffer in vain,” Nickel said. “This moment is bittersweet. It’s victory wrapped in grief. But I also hope that no other community has to wait this long to be heard.”

The waste was spread by efforts to remove it. After extracting valuable metals from the bomb waste, the buyer, Cotter Corp. initially received permission to use a pit at the Weldon Spring quarry in St. Charles County, which was already a disposal site for other radioactive waste.
After that decision was reversed over concerns that radiation was already leaking from the quarry, over a period of 2 ½ months in the summer and fall of 1973, Cotter took the problem into its own hands, without telling government regulators.
The company mixed the radioactive waste with tens of thousands of tons of contaminated soil from the site and illegally dumped it in a free, public landfill called West Lake, under three feet of soil and other garbage.
The landfill was declared a federal toxic Superfund site in 1990. In 2010, a subsurface smoldering event, similar to an underground fire, at the Bridgeton Landfill threatened the radioactive waste buried in the since-closed Westlake Landfill nearby. That fire sent noxious and hazardous fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. The company in charge of the Bridgeton Landfill now spends millions a year to contain it.
At the news conference, activists from across the country who lost family members told a part of their story and their fight for recognition and compensation.
Maggie Billiman, whose father Howard Billiman was a Navajo code talker in World War II, said her family lives downwind from where 100 nuclear weapons were tested. He died of stomach cancer in 2001.
“When we heard RECA was passed, we cried for happiness,” Billiman said.
Sherrie Hanna of Prescott, Arizona, said she lost both her husband and her father to cancer and received compensation under the act before it expired in 2024. She was worried it would not be renewed, Hanna said.
“For many of us downwinders, myself included, the question is not if we will receive a cancer diagnosis but when,” Hanna said.
To get the renewal and expansion passed, Hawley said he had to overcome resistance among Republicans to new federal spending and find legislation that had to pass to carry it.
“It happened because it’s justice,” Hawley said. “But there’s more to do.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)In what’s already becoming a sizzling U.S. Senate primary, the top three Republican candidates plan to participate in a Kentucky tradition known for politicians’ trading jabs in front of a crowd. 
Former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris confirmed with event organizers their plans to speak at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic in August. A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Andy Barr told the Kentucky Lantern he also plans to speak. 
The picnic, which is also a barbecue fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church in Graves County, has become a premier Kentucky tradition for elected officials and election hopefuls. In front of a fiery crowd of Republicans and Democrats, politicians take to the stage to lob verbal blows at their opponents — who are typically feet away watching the spectacle themselves. 
The only Democrat to announce for the U.S. Senate seat, Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, was invited to speak by picnic organizers, but had not responded to the invitation, according to a media advisory issued Tuesday. Her campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from the Lantern. 
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, whose plans to not run for reelection in 2026 set off the jockeying for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, has not yet confirmed his attendance with organizers this year but has acknowledged the invitation, the advisory said. He attended the Fancy Farm Picnic last year, and has gone to the event since the 1980s, when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate. Before the 2023 picnic, McConnell’s appearance was still pending in the days leading up to the event. 
An appearance on the stage this year could be an interesting one for McConnell, should he choose to go. The Republican candidates have attempted to distance themselves from the long-time incumbent in order to bring themselves closer to President Donald Trump, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the race. 
Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer and the Democratic candidate challenging him, John “Drew” Williams, of Marshall County, have both agreed to speak at the picnic. 
Other politicians speaking are: 

Republican Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell
Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman
Republican state Sen. Jason Howell
Republican state Rep. Kim Holloway

Fancy Farm Picnic organizers said that no one asked to speak so far has declined the invite. Republican state officers Auditor Allison Ball, Secretary of State Michael Adams and Treasurer Mark Metcalf have not confirmed their plans. Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul has also not confirmed if he will attend. 
Kentucky’s top Democrats — Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman — have not confirmed if they will attend the picnic this year. Neither of them attended last year’s event. The Fancy Farm Picnic is scheduled for Saturday, Aug. 2.

Advocates say a toxic supply of fentanyl is to blame.,"Twenty-two people died in Connecticut from fatal overdoses during a 72-hour period last weekend. Advocates say a toxic supply of fentanyl is to blame.
“This is a public health emergency. People need to know that there’s a toxic supply of opioids in Connecticut,” said John Hamilton, president of Liberation Programs, a treatment and prevention nonprofit based in Bridgeport.
He said there hasn’t been a spike like this since March, and that the state has actually recently seen a decrease in fatal overdoses.
Hamilton said there’s been an increase in fentanyl quantity in the samples they analyze at his organization, and that fentanyl has also been combined with medetomidine, an animal tranquilizer. He said this combination was first seen in Philadelphia a few years ago, but came to Connecticut only two months ago.
“If they’re going to use, people need to go low and slow because if they were using three bags before, and they use three bags today, it will kill them,” Hamilton said.
He said he and his team recognize that only one out of 10 people will seek treatment this year, so their goal is to keep the other nine out of 10 alive. They’re trying to do this by distributing Narcan, or Naloxone, and engaging with and informing people about the toxic supply.
According to a Yale School of Public Health report from 2016-2017, people who went into treatment for one month but didn’t receive medication to aid in their recovery were 70% more likely to fatally overdose than those who didn’t receive any treatment at all.
“[We’re trying to] keep them engaged and give them accurate information and treat them with love and dignity. They have a multitude of issues that they need to address before even considering treatment,” he said. “We try to build on their recovery capital until they’re ready to be involved in formal treatment. It’s the best treatment possible, which is meeting people where they are without our agenda, and we’ll continue to do that.”
He said they’ve increased their hours, too.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said at a press conference last week that fatal overdoses can’t continue. He said the potential cuts to Medicaid will leave people with fewer resources to fight their addictions.
The deaths occurred in Fairfield County, New Haven County and Hartford County.

DOVER — The Dover Hope Zone has kicked off a series of free summer events aimed at promoting fitness, wellness, and community engagement among local children and families through its new initiative, “Hope Streets.”
Designed as a community violence prevention program, Hope Streets transforms neighborhood parks and select streets—closed temporarily to traffic—into safe, active spaces where kids can play and families can gather.
The program also provides nutritious meals and snacks, play equipment, and a variety of structured activities in an effort to encourage healthy living and community connection.

Sponsored by Nemours Children’s Health, Hope Streets is made possible through collaboration with a wide range of local partners, including community centers, churches, youth-serving organizations, healthcare providers, schools, and local businesses.
Together, they offer services such as health screenings, water stations, music, EMT support, and volunteer-led activities.
Organizers aim to create opportunities for kids to be active and safe while bringing resources directly to neighborhoods that need them most.
Schedule for Hope Streets

The Dover Hope Zone is part of an interdisciplinary justice reinvestment initiative led by The Hope Commission, in partnership with the Wesley College of Health & Behavioral Sciences and Delaware State University.
While Hope Streets focuses on community wellness, the broader initiative provides critical reentry services for justice-involved individuals living in the 19901 and 19904 zip codes.
The Hope Commission, known as Delaware’s leading correctional reentry program, offers a comprehensive suite of services for high-risk men returning from incarceration.
Programs include cognitive-behavioral therapy, vocational training, educational support, behavioral health services, and family reunification—efforts aimed at reducing recidivism and enhancing public safety.

(Screenshot/WisEye)State laws that let a 10-member committee of the Legislature override regulations are unconstitutional, a majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
The ruling hands the administration of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers a victory in an ongoing battle with the Legislature’s Republican leaders.
It also affirms that the state Legislature cannot renew its attempt to block regulations against conversion therapy for LGBTQ people, and appears to clear the way for an update of Wisconsin’s building code that was suspended nearly two years ago.
The ruling finds five statutes, granting power to the Legislature’s committee that reviews and periodically suspends administrative rules, violate the Wisconsin Constitution.
Taken together, wrote Chief Justice Jill Karofsky for the four justices making up the Court’s liberal wing, the statutes give the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules the power to effectively change state laws without going through the full legislative process.
“The ability of a ten-person committee to halt or interrupt the passage of a rule, which would ordinarily be required to be presented to the governor as a bill [to block the rule], is simply incompatible with Articles IV and V of the Wisconsin Constitution,” Karofsky wrote.
The Court’s three conservative justices took issue with the majority opinion, asserting that rulemaking itself involves legislative power and that Tuesday’s ruling improperly constrains the Legislature as the elected representatives of the people.
‘Legislative veto’ lawsuit 
The decision is the second to come from a lawsuit Evers filed in the fall of 2023, Evers v. Marklein, accusing the Republican leaders of the Legislature of exercising an unconstitutional “legislative veto” hampering the lawful powers of the executive branch to make administrative rules.
The Evers administration argued that five statutes granting JCRAR the power to review, object to and block rules before or after they are promulgated violate the state Constitution. Those include a law enacted in December 2018, after Evers was elected governor but before he took office, that allows the committee to lodge “indefinite” objections blocking a rule.
The Court majority agreed with the administration’s argument.
The Wisconsin Constitution requires that for a law to be enacted, it must pass both the Assembly and the Senate and then be presented to the governor to be signed or vetoed.
“By permitting JCRAR to exercise discretion over which approved rules may be promulgated and which may not, the statute empowers JCRAR to take action that alters the legal rights and duties of persons outside of the legislative branch” without going through the lawmaking process, Karofsky wrote.
The indefinite objection “prevents the agency from promulgating a rule unless the Legislature passes a bill enacting the rule,” she wrote. “Said another way, legislative inertia after an indefinite objection could permanently stop the promulgation of a rule.”
The law allowing the committee to pause a rule for 30 days before it is promulgated “essentially allows JCRAR to capture control of agency rulemaking authority from the executive branch during the 30-day pause period,” Karofksy wrote.
The pause, which can be extended to 30 days “operates as a ‘pocket veto,’” she wrote. “Even if such an interruption is relatively brief, the constitution does not contemplate temporary violations of its provisions.”
Similarly, after the rule has been promulgated, JCRAR’s power to suspend it multiple times “means that even after promulgation, JCRAR could suspend a rule repeatedly in perpetuity with no other checks in place,” the chief justice wrote.
Clearing way for conversion therapy ban, new building code
In overturning the five statutes, the Court majority also revoked two earlier rulings that had affirmed some of JCRAR’s powers — one from 1992, upholding the committee’s temporary suspension of a rule, and the other from 2020, endorsing the power to suspend a rule multiple times.
Evers’ suit focused on two rules that JCRAR blocked, both produced under the umbrella of the state Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS).
One rule prohibited therapists from using discredited conversion therapy to try to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ people. It was adopted by the Wisconsin Marriage and Family Therapy, Professional Counseling, and Social Work Examining Board.
“When the Board created new professional conduct rules banning conversion therapy, it exercised its statutory authority,” Karofksy wrote. “But when JCRAR objected to the rule it effectively blocked the Board’s authority” under Wisconsin law “to govern the professional conduct of its licensees.”
The conversion therapy rule was suspended in January 2023, but reinstated after the Legislature concluded its work for the 2023-24 session.
With “the multiple suspension provision,” however, Karofsky wrote, “JCRAR has the authority to suspend this rule again, in perpetuity.”
Another rule updated the state commercial building code to international standards set in 2021.
“The goal of these chapters is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public,” Karofsky wrote. JCRAR’s indefinite suspension of the code in 2023  “prevented DSPS from completing its statutory rulemaking duties,” she wrote.
Conservative justices object
Justice Brian Hagedorn, one of three members of the Court’s conservative wing, wrote an opinion that concurred with the majority on narrow grounds but dissented on finding the five laws at issue unconstitutional.
The JCRAR indefinite objection to the building code rule is unconstitutional under a 1992 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling, Hagedorn wrote.
He argued that the conversion therapy rule is now outside the Court’s purview, however.
“This ethical rule is already in effect; it is no longer suspended,” Hagedorn wrote. “Since a ruling on JCRAR’s actions with respect to this rule would have no legal effect, this claim is moot, and we have nothing further to decide.”
Hagedorn criticized the decision’s far-reaching findings that whole statutes were unconstitutional, however. He said it also failed to grapple with arguments about the constitutional status of regulation by executive branch agencies.
“The effect of the majority’s decision is to greenlight executive alteration of legal rights and duties outside the lawmaking process while prohibiting legislative alteration of legal rights and duties outside the lawmaking process,” Hagedorn wrote.
Former Chief Justice Annette Ziegler and Justice Rebecca Bradley published separate sharply worded dissents.
Ziegler wrote that the majority ruling was the outcome of “this court’s misguided quest to restructure and unbalance our state government, culminating in even more power and control being allocated to the executive branch.”
“The legislature has delegated executive branch agencies broad rulemaking authority with the understanding that it will be able to oversee administrative rulemaking through JCRAR,” Ziegler wrote. “The majority now pulls the rug out from under the legislature…”
Bradley, invoking lyrics from Bruce Springsteen’s song “Badlands” in which the singer says “a king ain’t satisfied ‘til he rules everything,” charged that the majority “lets the executive branch exercise lawmaking power unfettered and unchecked.”
Her dissent offered a full-throated attack on the administrative state and executive branch regulatory authority.
“The majority invokes the Wisconsin Constitution to take power from the People’s elected representatives in the legislature and bestow it on the executive branch, empowering unelected bureaucrats to rule over the People,” Bradley wrote.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Local grocers sounded alarm bells Tuesday about the potential negative impacts that incoming restrictions to Nebraska’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could have on businesses and the more than 150,000 Nebraskans who use the program. 
During this year’s legislative session, lawmakers passed waivers to SNAP — a government food assistance service some also refer to as food stamps. The updates would remove soda and other energy drinks from the list of SNAP-eligible purchases starting in 2026. 
Nebraska would be the first state in the nation to ban soda and energy drinks from SNAP purchases. Gov. Jim Pillen has publicly supported the state waivers, referring to the affected drinks as “junk.”
“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” Pillen said at a USDA event in May. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved the waivers, and Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services held a hearing Tuesday to hear public comments on the proposed changes. The updates still require approval from DHHS’ Office of Economic Assistance, Pillen and the Attorney General before they take effect. 
USDA approval also comes on the heels of congressional passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill, which will increase work requirements for SNAP participation, requirements not addressed during the state hearing. 
Only two people spoke at the hearing — representing advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed and the Nebraska Grocery Industry Association — though more organizations submitted written testimony that were not immediately made available to the public. 
Public comments
Shannon McCord, vice president of the grocer group’s board of directors and operator of a local grocery store in Superior, Nebraska, said the “state-by-state patchwork approach” to SNAP regulations is confusing to retailers and could do more harm than good. 
“Even if the intention is good, these waivers are going to add costs and do real harm to local grocers,” McCord said. 
The waivers would require grocers to update their payment systems, which McCord described as a “costly and complex task” that would be significantly harder for small and rural retailers like himself to accomplish. His store in Superior is also near the Kansas border, which does not have the same SNAP restrictions, and he fears the changes could encourage his customers to travel across the border for their groceries. 
For businesses operating on slim margins like his own, McCord said the restrictions could force owners to make layoffs or other cutbacks, or even close their doors. Additionally, he said it would add shame and stigma to customers who depend on SNAP. 
“If (retailers) disappear and we develop a food desert, are we really solving a health problem when customers are only getting food from dollar stores and processed boxed foods?” McCord asked. 
Madison Castor, law clerk with Nebraska Appleseed, said past attempts at restricting access to SNAP have undermined the program’s effectiveness. Rather than imposing restrictions, she claimed that efforts to add incentives to use SNAP benefits on healthier food items like produce have proven more effective at promoting healthier living. 
By forcing businesses to update their payment systems, Castor feared that would reduce the number of businesses that accept SNAP as payment overall. This would greatly impact the health and livelihoods of Nebraskans who rely on the service. 
“SNAP is a vital and temporary lifeline for thousands of Nebraskans,” Castor said. “Over 150,000 of us count on SNAP to help put food on the table at a time when costs are high and family budgets are tight. These proposed rules seek to implement a SNAP restriction waiver that harms the dignity and autonomy of Nebraskans.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Tuesday it launched a Water Quality Initiative project to reduce nitrate and other nutrient runoff in the Beaver Creek watershed, which is upstream of Des Moines. 
IDALS joined Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District and several other partners on the initiative, which will install saturated buffers, oxbows, bioreactors and promote the use of cover crops in the watershed over the next three years. 
A press release from IDALS said the project follows the “batch and build” model the department has used to streamline the construction process and complete more projects in a given watershed.

“Iowans expect progress when it comes to water quality, and that’s exactly what this project helps to deliver,” Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement. “This partnership project is a great example of how we can bring farmers, landowners, and public and private partners together to accelerate this important work and be part of the solution.” 


Water Quality Initiative tools: 
— Oxbows: a bow-shaped meander of a stream, separated from the flow of water, that acts as a wetland to prevent flooding, provide habitat for wildlife and filter nutrients.
— Saturated buffers: an area of vegetation between cropland and waterways, usually where a tile line drains, that helps absorb nutrients from water before it drains into a stream.
— Bioreactors: a trench buried on the edge of a field at a tile outlet and typically filled with woodchips that allow microorganisms to remove nitrates from the water and instead release them as nitrogen gas.
— Cover crops: a crop planted between cash crop rotations to help keep nutrients and soil in a field. 


The department has already completed more than 20 water quality initiative projects in the Beaver Creek watershed, which flows into the Des Moines River on the north side of the capital city’s metro. 
In mid June, Central Iowa Water Works, which represents 600,000 central Iowa customers, issued a lawn watering ban due to high nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines River and Raccoon River, which serve as surface water sources.
A two-year water quality study, commissioned by Polk County to investigate water quality issues in the region’s main rivers, was also released in the same time period. The report pointed to agriculture as a main source of nitrate pollution in the rivers. 
A spokesperson for IDALS said the Beaver Creek watershed is an “important watershed” and the project has been “in the works” prior to the recent public awareness of the nitrate issue. 
“We are actively recruiting landowners and locations for practices, and we are also recruiting more public and private partners who want to help us get more practices established,” Don McDowell, the department’s public information officer, said in an email.

Segments of Beaver Creek have been on the Department of Natural Resource’s list of impaired waters since 2016. 
DNR is also a partner in the project, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Service, Polk County Public Works and The Nature Conservancy. 
According to the press release, IDALS allocated $244,100 to the project.
The Beaver Creek project also promotes the use of cover crops, which can help keep nutrients in the soil when cash crops aren’t growing. IDALS’s Water Quality Initiative has a cost-share program for farmers interested in adding cover crops into their rotation.
“By partnering with local farmers and landowners and by investing in proven conservation practices like bioreactors, saturated buffers, oxbows, and cover crops, we’re improving water quality in these communities as well as for those downstream, including the Des Moines metro,” Naig said. 
Jeremy Gustafson, a Boone County farmer, and chair of the Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District, said the partnership between the organizations will “showcase modern approaches to water quality improvements.” 
Farmers and others interested in the project can reach out to the Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District office or contact Justin Grieff at the office.

(Courtesy photo)A retired New Mexico state government worker and game warden and county-level elected official has entered the race for New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands.
Michael Perry enters as the first Republican running in the June 2, 2026 primary election, according to New Mexico Secretary of State data. Three Democrats also will vie in the race: Juan Sanchez, Jonas Montoya and Matthew McQueen. The general election will take place Nov. 3, 2026.
“If you evaluate resume to resume, this isn’t a political issue,” he told Source NM on Tuesday. “It’s not Democrat or Republican, it’s about making our landscapes green and our watersheds beautiful blue. ”
A Roswell High School graduate, Perry serves on the Chaves County Commission as its vice chair, in the third year of his first term. He also sits on the National Association of Counties’ Public Lands Policy Steering Committee.
He said if elected, he wants to emphasize better forest management to prevent catastrophic wildfires and floods.
Perry said forest landscapes are overgrown and need to be thinned out, particularly around New Mexico’s suburban areas. He praised the Mescalero Apache Tribe’s timber management, saying the South Fork and Salt fires could have been much worse without it.
“I would spend more on the fuel reduction on state property,” Perry said. “The flood events aren’t necessarily because we’ve had an increase in rain. It’s just because the forest was in such poor condition that when it’s highly burned … the rain can actually hit the ground and not get caught up in the canopy.”
He said he started thinking about running for land commissioner five years ago. He has never run for statewide office.
“Being retired from state government, I know how it works,” Perry said. “I want to make sure that in our production of money from the land, that we’re doing it in a mindful and prescriptive way that’s going to leave the resources in a good position for future generations.”
Perry also works as a private consultant through his company Wildlife and Habitat Prescriptions, LLC, helping ranchers with watershed management, water catchment systems and reduction of woody vegetation.
He said Public Lands Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, who is term-limited and cannot run for reelection, has done a decent job at putting land remediation projects at the forefront of the land office’s work.
Perry worked on landscape restoration and remediation and habitat management at the State Land Office from 2016 to 2019, first as an assistant commissioner in the field division and then as a district resource manager.
“I’ve done the right-of-ways, and then made the big decisions at the very top,” he said. “The major thing that I worked on when I was there was access issues: trying to get the public the access that they deserve through suitable roads onto large tracts of state land, so that they could actually be utilized instead of landlocked.”
Perry was also a game warden at the New Mexico Game and Fish Department, and eventually oversaw state land easements in coordination with the land office.
“All those locations that are accessible through those permits, those are the gates that are open, I started that program,” he said.
Before that, Perry was a major for southern field operations at the Game and Fish Department. He received a degree in wildlife biology from New Mexico State University.
“I’ve worked all my life outside, in the law enforcement field chasing bad guys or with a chainsaw cutting down trees, so this is new to me,” he said.

May 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers on Tuesday announced that his office is suing General Motors for allegedly collecting and selling data on drivers without their consent for at least the past decade.
The 40-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday morning in Lancaster County District Court, alleges that Michigan-based General Motors and associated OnStar products collected driver data and sold it to third-party companies without drivers’ consent since at least 2015. In turn, that data would be sold to insurance companies, sometimes leading to increased rates or canceled insurance. 
Collected data allegedly included how fast someone was driving, how hard stops were, geolocation and whether seat belts were worn.
“We know that you can actually do what these insurance companies and what companies like GM want to do legally, through consent, through notice, through disclosures,” Hilgers told reporters. “It’s not what they did here.”
The lawsuit alleges an “aggressive, concerted effort” to enroll purchasers into GM products, which Hilgers said led to some drivers being opted into the products without their consent in what he termed “emotional blackmail” — that OnStar and other services were necessary for family or personal safety or that the data wouldn’t be shared except in “limited circumstances.”
According to the lawsuit, General Motors has 54 dealerships in Nebraska, does business with 19 Nebraska suppliers and has 16 Nebraska-based employees.

While Hilgers couldn’t say how many Nebraskans were impacted over the past 10 years, the lawsuit says GM delivered nearly 19,000 vehicles to the state in 2023.
General Motors began partnering with car insurance companies in 2005, the lawsuit continues, to allow drivers to opt in for data collection so they could receive a discount for “good” driving.
But Hilgers’ office says such devices became “unnecessary” over time even as the products have been installed by default in almost all new GM vehicles since 2015.
Hilgers said an attorney in his office combed through all of GM’s privacy terms and conditions and found “nothing that we think clears up what we think is very misleading, very deceptive activity.”
The Nebraska Examiner has reached out to General Motors for comment on Hilgers’ lawsuit. The company had no immediate reply.
Asked whether Hilgers’ office had contacted GM or OnStar before Tuesday, Hilgers said: “They’re aware of our investigation.” He said part of the lawsuit seeks to understand the “full scope” of how Nebraskans were harmed to craft a remedy specific to those consumers.
The lawsuit by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office follows a nearly identical lawsuit by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed in August. The Federal Trade Commission also proposed a settlement against GM in January. The company said it would “go above and beyond existing law” but mirror new protections the company had been rolling out to give customers “more transparency and control.”
FTC Chair Lina Khan in January said GM collected data sometimes as often as every three seconds. The FTC has not yet voted to finalize the settlement order, a spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.
The Nebraska lawsuit alleges “deceptive” and “unconscionable” trade practices by GM and asks for a jury trial with the following requested relief: 

Civil penalties of $2,000 per violation of Nebraska’s Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act or its Consumer Protection Act.
A permanent ban on GM and others engaging in such conduct.
Any money acquired as a result of the violations to be restored to impacted consumers.
State legal fees.
“Any other relief” the court deems “just and equitable.”

In addition to the AG’s Office, Nebraska is working with three attorneys based out of Seattle and Houston from the Susman Godfrey law firm.
“We filed this lawsuit because one large company decided that it wouldn’t honestly tell Nebraskans that their data was going to be used to impact their insurance rates. This is wrong,” Hilgers said. “Our office will hold companies that mislead Nebraskans accountable, no matter how large.”

SHILOH COMMUNITY, Ala.—Pastor Timothy Williams said he’s not giving up his fight for justice.
It’s a battle that has garnered national headlines and brought prominent leaders, including then Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, to the small, historically Black community with the goal of addressing repeated flooding caused by the elevation of US-84, a project overseen by the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT).
Years into that battle, and despite a resolution agreement between state and federal officials meant to stem the flow of stormwater off the highway, little progress has been made to keep the flooding from inundating residents’ homes, according to community members.

Now, Williams and five other Black residents have brought their struggle to the courts, filing suit against ALDOT and John Cooper, its director.
“We got tired of waiting on ALDOT,” Williams said in an interview Monday. “We had high hopes that they were going to come on out and fix this issue in a timely manner. But we’ve seen they are not going to keep their promises, so we filed suit.”
In an e-mailed statement, Dalton Middleton, a communications specialist for ALDOT, said that the agency is aware of the lawsuit and “will be reviewing it.” In the past, the agency has denied that flooding issues in the Shiloh Community are the result of racial discrimination.
The lawsuit, filed July 1 in federal court, alleges that the flooding in Shiloh continues to worsen as rainwater erodes the land around US-84.
“The flooding and erosion continue, and at this time, it is not possible to know when it will stabilize,” the lawsuit said. “As the flooding has gotten worse and worse, Plaintiffs began to search for a way to stem the rising tide of water from every rain event.”
That search included filing complaints in 2021 and 2022 with the Federal Highway Administration, which helped fund the initial highway expansion, completed during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Later, under President Joe Biden, the federal agency announced a voluntary resolution agreement it said would lead to relief for residents.
The rollout of that agreement coincided with Buttigieg’s visit to Shiloh, where the then-cabinet official promised a “whole-of-government” approach to addressing the ongoing flooding.

The voluntary resolution agreement laid out two options for addressing the continued flooding. One option would have involved purchasing additional right-of-way from residents in order to relocate a stormwater discharge point and construct a drainage ditch to divert rainwater away from homes to a “natural outfall point” south of the Shiloh community. If officials were unable to purchase the land needed for that plan, the agreement outlined a second option, involving the deepening of ditches and the construction of an additional detention basin to handle stormwater runoff from US-84.
Despite the voluntary resolution agreement and Buttigieg’s commitment, residents have said the rain-induced floods have continued, putting at risk homes and properties that have been in their families for generations.
“Suffice it to say, little to nothing has been done,” the residents’ lawsuit said.
“We don’t have any trust in ALDOT,” Williams told Inside Climate News. “ALDOT has damaged our community and done nothing to fix that damage.”
Now, residents have asked a federal court to intervene, claiming that the flooding amounts to “a taking without just compensation in violation of the takings clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the taking of private property for public use by a government entity.”
The flooding constitutes a “taking,” counsel for the residents argued, because “it impairs the use of enjoyment” of their property and homes and has decreased their property values.
The suit asks for the court to award damages to residents to compensate residents for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, the diminution of the value of their properties and for damages “for the mental anguish of having the properties flooded.”
In addition, residents have requested that the court order ALDOT to either meet the conditions of the first option outlined in the resolution agreement or begin implementing option two.

Robert Bullard, a Coffee County native who was a member of President Joe Biden’s Environmental Justice Advisory Council, has long said that the continued water woes in Shiloh are intentional, not simply the result of bad engineering.
“Water goes downhill, and it doesn’t take a Ph.D. to understand that,” said Bullard, a distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University and director of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice there. “This was done on purpose. This wasn’t an accidental ‘oops.’ ALDOT cared more about not flooding the highway than they did about flooding the community. That is unacceptable.”
Bullard has said that he will continue to return to Shiloh and advocate for a permanent fix for residents who’ve been subjected to stormwater runoff for years.
“We’re going to be like the Terminator,” he said. “We’ll be back, and we have a laser focus. We want justice for Shiloh.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Timothy-Williams-for-July-8-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

(Environment America Research and Policy Center)Nearly two-thirds of Louisiana beaches tested positive for harmful levels of fecal bacteria last year, according to a new report on potential health risks at America’s coastal recreation areas. 
The testing from the Environment America Research and Policy Center focused on 23 beaches in Louisiana out of nearly 3,200 tested nationwide in 2024. Of the 10 Louisiana beaches where tests found the water was “potentially unsafe” most often, eight sites were in Cameron Parish. 
Environment America compared its test samples with the Environmental Protection Agency’s highest water quality metric, which estimates that no more than 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers get sick from the amount of harmful bacteria present. All Louisiana beaches tested had at least one day of sampling that exceeded this threshold. 
“Even as Louisianans are back to enjoying the fresh sea breeze and splash of waves at the beach, pollution is still plaguing too many of the places where we swim,” said John Rumpler, one of the report’s authors and the clean water director for the Environment America Research and Policy Center, in a press release. 
Bacterial water pollution can come from a variety of sources, such as sewage overflows from old and aging sewer systems, and runoff from farms with livestock. 
The combination of increased development and fewer wetlands can also propagate the spread of harmful bacteria throughout waterways. Wetlands act as filters for bacterial pollution, and an overabundance of parking lots, houses and roads funnel runoff into rivers and lakes instead of allowing it to be absorbed into the ground. 
The worst testing results in Louisiana were at Rutherford Beach, where the Mermentau River empties into the Gulf of Mexico in Cameron Parish. Its water was found to be potentially unsafe on 19 of the 28 days tested last year. Fecal bacteria frequency was also high at Martin Beach in Cameron Parish and at five sections of Holly Beach. 
North Beach, on the upper shore of Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, saw unsafe test results on 19 of the 30 days sampled. 
Poor water quality was reported at Fontainebleau State Park in St. Tammany Parish on 12 of the 29 days tested, placing it 10th among state beaches with the worst test results.  
The Environment America Research and Policy Center is calling for a deeper commitment to improving water infrastructure as well as protecting wetlands, reworking the way farms handle livestock manure and expanding testing for harmful bacteria at beaches.
“Now is the time to fix our water infrastructure and stop the flow of pathogens to our beaches,” Rumpler said. 
The Gulf Coast had the highest percentage of potentially unsafe sampling days out of any region in the study despite having only 218 of the 1,930 sampling spots. Testing showed 84% of Gulf Coast beaches had at least one potentially unsafe day, followed by the West Coast (79%), Great Lakes (71%), East Coast (54%) and Alaska and Hawaii (10%). 
Nationally, 61% of beaches had at least one day with potentially unsafe bacteria levels.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/output_LA-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders mobilized 22 soldiers Monday, including pilots and crew chiefs, and six maintenance personnel, according to a press release. Additionally, two soldiers were ordered to state active duty to serve as liaison officers in Arkansas to coordinate direct support to deployed soldiers as needed. 
More than 100 people have died following extraordinary rainfall that led to severe flooding in Central Texas, according to The Texas Tribune.
“Our hearts go out to those affected in Texas,” said Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas’ adjutant general. “Under Governor Sanders’ leadership and direction, we’re eager to assist our brothers and sisters in the Texas National Guard as they continue to respond and recover from the Texas flooding.” 
In response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request received from Texas yesterday, the Arkansas National Guard generated a four-helicopter departure Tuesday morning, Bridges said in the release. The compact allows states to send personnel and equipment to help response and recovery efforts in other states.
One Black Hawk crew will be ready to provide medical evacuation support, while the other three crews can provide hoist capability, visual searches, passenger movement and cargo movement.
The orders last through Saturday, but can be adjusted based on mission needs, according to the release.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl officially launched a run for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District Tuesday, seeking to fill the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra as the congressman considers a gubernatorial bid.
Windschitl, a 41-year-old former Marine from Missouri Valley, has been a longtime member of the Iowa House. He was first elected to the Legislature in 2006 at age 22, and has taken on leadership roles in the years since — he was elected House majority leader in 2019, and previously served as assistant leader and speaker pro tempore for the House GOP caucus.
Now, he is looking at a move from the Iowa House to the U.S. House. In a news release announcing his run Tuesday, Windschitl said he would “bring Iowa’s conservative values to Washington” if elected.

“Our freedoms are constantly under attack from the Left — I will continue to fight to secure our borders, and protect our farmers and families who need a strong advocate to fight against bureaucratic red tape and inflation,” Windschitl said in a statement. “I’m ready to join President Trump and fight back.”
He also thanked Feenstra, the current representative for Iowa’s 4th District, for his work in Congress and more recently for “his critical role in helping pass President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Iowa’s 4th District, covering much of northwest Iowa, is a longtime GOP stronghold, and has been represented by Feenstra since 2021. In the 2020 election season, he won the Republican primary against incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve King, and went on to win the general election against Democrat state Rep. J.D. Scholten — who is now running in 2026 against Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst.
Feenstra is retiring from Congress to run for Iowa governor. Shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection in 2026, Feenstra announced an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor.
Though he has not yet officially announced a shift from “exploring” a run for governor to running for the position, Feenstra has received major endorsements from top Iowa Republicans in recent days. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst endorsed his run for governor Monday and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks gave an endorsement earlier in July. Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, who is running for state auditor in 2026, gave her endorsement for his gubernatorial run Tuesday, saying she supported him “because I know he delivers for Iowa.”
“In the Iowa Senate, Randy and I both voted for tax cuts, increased government efficiency and accountability which all protect the budgets of hardworking Iowa families and seniors,” Cournoyer said. “I look forward to continuing to work with him as State Auditor to help take Iowa to new heights.”
Aiming to take over for Feenstra in the U.S. House, Windschitl said he would focus on conservative policies in Washington, D.C., such as protecting gun access, securing the U.S. border, “standing for life and protecting the unborn,” and pursuing lower taxes.
Two other Republicans are also looking at runs for the 4th District seat in 2026. Iowa Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, announced an exploratory committee for the congressional race in May, and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan announced his bid for the seat in June. Democrat Ryan Melton, who ran campaigns against Feenstra and lost in 2022 and 2024, had announced his 2026 4th District campaign earlier in the year, but suspended his run in June.
Windschitl said in campaign launch that he was ready to compete for the seat in 2026.
“I’ve never backed down from a fight — not in the Marines, not in the Iowa Legislature, and not now,” Windschitl said. “I’ll bring that same tenacity to Washington to stand up for the people of Iowa.”
As Windschitl aims to move from the Statehouse to Congress, he plans to step down as House majority leader while serving out the remainder of his term representing House District 15, the Des Moines Register reported.
This means Iowa House Republicans must elect a new majority leader. While House GOP officials did not respond to requests for comment about leadership elections, President Donald Trump referred to Rep.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)This article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
Amid all the worries about the perennially elusive youth vote, there’s a promising trend to talk about: In a growing number of towns and cities across the U.S., 16- and 17-year-olds are gaining the right to vote. The numbers are still small, but the momentum is real. Advocates say it’s about nurturing lifelong voters.
Take Newark, New Jersey, which allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in its school board election in April. Teen turnout was only about 3%. But that was better than the adults managed. Besides, as Sam Novey from the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement puts it, the city “started from nothing.”
Indeed, adding younger teens to the voter rolls involves building a lot of things from scratch. After Newark passed its ordinance last year allowing youth voting, officials had to rewire voter registration systems and launch a full-scale education campaign. It was about 14 months before 16- and 17-year-olds could cast their first ballots.
“Comparatively lightning fast,” Novey said.
And there’s a payoff to look forward to.
“Research shows that those who are allowed to register and begin voting at 16 are more likely to vote later in life than their peers,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky. “It’s an important way to increase participation.”
In short: Get ’em young, and they’ll keep coming back. The act of voting becomes normal, even expected. And school, Douglas said, is an ideal environment for that first civic nudge — with teachers and peers available to discuss the issues.
The research Douglas cited looked at Scotland, which allowed 16-year-olds to vote in its 2014 independence referendum. The decision was initially controversial, but “nothing bad happened,” said Jan Eichhorn, a political science professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies youth participation and cowrote the study. “Adults realized teenagers were paying attention, often more than adults.”
Public support for youth voting soared in Scotland after that.
The U.S. has been slower to move. Nationwide, the U.S. Constitution guarantees voting rights only for people 18 and older. But at the local level, things are heating up.
Right now, Maryland leads the way. Several municipalities there have already lowered the voting age for local races, taking advantage of state law that makes it easy for municipalities to accommodate registration and ballots for 16- and 17-year olds. A local council vote is enough to change quite a lot of election rules, including, for example, allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.
Compare that with Oakland, California, where voters approved youth voting back in 2020 — only to have to wait four full years for Alameda County to get around to updating its registration systems, a much longer delay than Newark.
In other words, even when the people say yes, the bureaucracy can say, “We’ll get to it eventually.”
That’s what Novey wants everyone to know: that lowering the voting age isn’t just a matter of changing policy. “It touches on a lot of different systems and issues,” he said. Some cities might be able to handle the transition in-house, but others may need new tech, new training, and a lot of patience and support.
In Newark, one of the biggest forces behind the policy was the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. Attorney Micauri Vargas, the associate counsel for the institute’s Democracy & Justice program who drafted the ordinance, said supporters “knew it wasn’t going to get done statewide,” despite Gov. Phil Murphy mentioning it in his last two State of the State speeches. So they went local, to the state’s largest city, where the mayor and City Council were supportive — and, notably, where the movement had been “started by the students.”
Not everyone was cheering. “People still just don’t feel comfortable with young people having a say in what they think are only money matters, but they aren’t,” Vargas said.
Even some teenagers were skeptical. “But then other young people would ask them if they trusted themselves, and they always said they did,” Vargas said. “They changed their minds.”
This question is about more than voting rules. It’s about trust — not just in systems, but in young people’s ability to shape them. And like Eichhorn said, some adults might just need to spend more time with teenagers to see what they’re capable of.
Of course, there are critics of expanding the franchise this way. Some argue that it’s a slippery slope, or that teenagers are too immature or uninformed to handle voting responsibly. But Douglas points out that we don’t typically take voting rights away from adults on that basis — “even ones who may be legally incompetent. Yet bright, informed 16-year-olds can’t vote.” Fair point.
For now, youth voting in America is a patchwork, enabled by quirks in local laws, driven by ambitious students, and supported by researchers like Novey and his Vote 16 Network, which offers best practices for cities.
And it’s still far from mainstream. But so was same-day registration once. So was voting by mail. So was early voting. All of those ideas sounded radical at some point — until they didn’t.

(Photo: North Carolina Department of Commerce HUD CDBG-DR Helene recovery Action Plan)North Carolina officials have denied a local firm’s request for the state to re-bid a critical hurricane rebuilding contract.
The state held a hearing last month after IEM International, which is based in Morrisville, filed a complaint alleging that it was improperly disqualified from receiving the $81.5 million contract. Horne, another firm based in Mississippi, won the bid. It is tasked with managing a group of contractors and leading the rebuild of western homes after the deadliest and most destructive storm in state history.
IEM’s protest on the decision was denied on June 30, the firm said in a statement. Company officials have 60 days to decide if they want to appeal the ruling through the state’s administrative process.
“IEM was disappointed that the decision letter did not address a significant amount of the substantive evidence we presented to the agency during the protest,” the company said in a statement.
That 20-page decision letter, provided to NC Newsline, outlines the state’s rebuttal to IEM’s complaints. Among those complaints: that the state’s bidding process was biased for Horne, that IEM’s bid was rejected arbitrarily, and that Horne was “not a responsible vendor” and should not have been awarded the contract.
NC Department of Commerce officials rejected IEM’s protest on all counts, providing the most thorough and explicit defense of Horne since the firm was awarded the contract. State lawmakers have separately begun to probe the bid process, questioning Horne’s prior work in and out of state.
“Commerce is focused on delivering results for Helene survivors in western North Carolina who need our help getting back into their homes,” department spokesperson David Rhoades said in a statement. “We’ve received well over 300 applications so far for the Renew NC single-family housing program and we remain hopeful we can start construction work on the first homes later this summer.”
And Horne’s attorneys have issued their own response, accusing IEM of making “desperate attacks” and digging up “misleading” documents about a legal settlement the firm made earlier this year.
“Now that IEM’s meritless bid protest has been rejected by the Department on all grounds, it appears IEM is just continuing to sling mud,” attorney Mitch Armbruster, who represents Horne, wrote in an emailed statement to NC Newsline. “HORNE, however, is already on the ground providing critical services to the areas of western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene.”
How IEM protested the bid — and how the state rejected it
IEM’s bid was disqualified, state officials say, because it did not include enough financial information.
The firm wrote in the bid that its financial statements were not public, but could be provided upon request. But the contract bid “was the request,” state officials responded — so that section was deemed incomplete. IEM’s bid was ruled ineligible and was not graded, according to scoring documents.
IEM has also taken issue with the state’s request, and how it was constructed. The firm argued that North Carolina’s technical specifications “were designed to favor Horne,” according to the state’s decision letter. And it alleged that there was a conflict of interest because a former Horne employee drafted the contract criteria.
Jonathan Krebs, Gov. Josh Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, was involved in the draft process. He worked for Horne until April 2024. But state officials, in their letter to IEM, said his involvement and role were standard fare.
“It is not unreasonable for the state to utilize someone who has expertise in disaster recovery in the drafting of a [contract request],” they wrote.
“There is no indication that Jonathan Kreb[s] … has a conflict of interest, as defined by law,” they added.
As for IEM’s argument that the contract’s criteria favored Horne, they wrote that the specifications were “more than appropriate and does not demonstrate bias.”
Armbruster, the attorney for Horne, wrote that “IEM proposed the highest cost bid of all bidders, to do less work, and failed to provide basic audited financial reports” as part of their offer.
After IEM attempts to revisit legal settlement and past work, Horne pushes back
IEM’s arguments for a re-bid went beyond disagreements about the state’s process. The company also argued to the state that its competitor should not have been awarded the contract in the first place.
Horne is an “irresponsible vendor,” IEM argued, and should have been ruled ineligible for the contract. IEM cited a previous contract between North Carolina and Horne that ended in 2021; Horne’s involvement in a data breach class action lawsuit; and Horne’s having faced allegations of “incompetence and fraud.”
Attorneys for Horne also sat in on the state hearing and presented counter-arguments.
Horne served as prime contractor during North Carolina’s hurricane recovery efforts in the eastern part of the state, from 2019 to 2022. That homebuilding operation was beset by complaints of poor case management, accounting errors and communications. The contract was not renewed.
State officials wrote that Horne’s Helene recovery bid met all of their qualifications. And they cited the firm’s own rebuttal, in which they said that Horne and the state “jointly agreed to not renew the ReBuild NC contract.”
The state also disputed IEM’s description of both legal matters. A Mississippi court granted Horne’s motion to dismiss the data breach case, officials wrote. The fraud allegations, meanwhile, stem from a case in West Virginia that led to a $1.2 million settlement in April.
State officials wrote that Horne settled “to avoid the time and expense of a legal defense, but that there ‘was no fraud.'”
In that West Virginia case, Horne was tapped to develop the state’s plan to use federal block grant dollars (the same kind that will be used in western North Carolina). West Virginia officials found that a contract originally valued at $900,000 had expanded to $18 million. And a news release from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development’s watchdog described “problematic” invoices from Horne that included property inspections for vacant lots and fictitious applicant information.
Horne says the company, as part of the settlement, did not admit any wrongdoing. IEM, during its protest, referenced a document from a federal watchdog about the case.
That document is an investigation report from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development’s inspector general’s office. A copy of the report, obtained by NC Newsline, states that “Horne … supplied the State of West Virginia with a fraudulent invoice for payment.”
“HUD will not pursue suspension or debarment action against Horne related to this matter,” officials wrote in the report, which was dated April 30 and made available to the public in mid-May.
Both Horne’s attorney and state officials point to language in the report noting that it “contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the Office of the Inspector General.”
“The State of N.C. awarded the contract to Horne on May 9 prior to the release of this document,” said Rhoades, the department spokesperson. “We also conducted due diligence with HUD’s Office of Inspector General ourselves.”
Armbruster, Horne’s attorney, said that IEM did not include the OIG document in its official protest materials — only displaying “a screenshot of the report in a PowerPoint” during the meeting. And Horne did not know the document existed until after that meeting, he said.
“IEM’s protest raises the West Virginia matter and other complaints in its protest for no other reason than to sling mud,” Armbruster wrote. “It has zero legal bearing on the procurement.”
Separately, Horne has also sought to correct the record on how the West Virginia case has been publicly portrayed. Another attorney for Horne sent a letter to Lisa Johnston, the U.S. Attorney for Southern District of West Virginia, in late May.
In the letter, attorney John W. Huber called the department’s press release about the settlement “misleading and improper.”
“Adding language that simply slanders a defendant to make a press release sound more dramatic is entirely inappropriate, and unfortunately too common,” Huber wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-4-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and quickly requested the temporary restraining order, which was issued later that day.The suit alleges Planned Parenthood was singled out “in order to punish them for lawful activity, namely advocating for and providing legal abortion access wholly outside the Medicaid program and without using any federal funds.”The filing also says more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees go to Planned Parenthood in a given year and that the organization received more than one-third of its total aggregate revenue from Medicaid reimbursement during fiscal year 2023. District Court Judge Indira Talwani’s brief two-page temporary restraining order called on the Trump administration to file a status update later this week. And she set an in-person hearing later this month to hear from Planned Parenthood and the Trump administration.Talwani was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama.The Trump administration has yet to file any documents in the case and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom about the judge’s temporary restraining order. Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Justice plans to challenge the temporary restraining order.""Absolutely, yes. We're on it,” Bondi said.  Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah — the three groups that filed the lawsuit — wrote in a statement they were “grateful that the court acted swiftly to block this unconstitutional law attacking Planned Parenthood providers and patients.“Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive health care because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood. There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the ‘defunding’ of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand.

The move effectively calls for a carve out for religious organizations from the rarely used IRS rule called the Johnson Amendment, put in place in 1954 and named after then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson.
In a joint court filing intended to end an ongoing case against the IRS, the tax collection agency and the National Religious Broadcasters Association — a Evangelical media consortium — and other plaintiffs have asked a federal court in Texas to stop the government from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiffs.
The Johnson Amendment is a 1954 amendment to the U.S. tax code that prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.
The Christian media group and others filed suit against the IRS last August, stating that the amendment violates their First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, among other legal protections. On Monday, the IRS and plaintiffs wrote that the Johnson Amendment should be interpreted “so that it does not reach communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith.”
The New York Times was first to report the news of the court filing.
The IRS has generally not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech related to electoral politics.
President Donald Trump has said he wanted to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and signed an executive order in 2017 directing Treasury to disregard the rule.
“I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” Trump said at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, which is a high-profile event bringing together faith leaders, politicians and dignitaries.
Representatives from the IRS and the National Religious Broadcasters Association did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

(Preston Keres/USDA)Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks.
These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget.
The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.”
The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes.
Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.
 Lowering the information barrier

Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.
Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.
Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.
“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.
This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.
Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.
She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.
“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.
He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.
“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”
Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s  extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions.
“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.”
Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change.
She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations.
Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers.
“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”
The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics.
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill.
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs.
“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads.
Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.”
“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”
The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.
The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies.
 Reports form the Hub

While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.
Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said.
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture.
Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.
The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions.
The hub, in collaboration with on Midwestern Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates.
Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts.
She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.”
“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said.
Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.”
“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The group behind the black mass in March at the Kansas Statehouse — which drew thousands of counter-protesters and ended in multiple arrests — was denied a permit to hold another protest this summer.
Michael Stewart, the Satanic Grotto leader, says the denial is religious discrimination. Adam Proffitt, the Kansas secretary of administration, says the permit was denied because of safety concerns and violence at the last protest.
Stewart was planning a “witching hour protest” from 9 p.m. to midnight on Aug. 2 with the same sentiment as the black mass: “to end Christian favoritism within our state government,” as the group’s Facebook post reads.
“This isn’t just a permit denial; it’s an outright cancellation of our right to protest, fueled by what appears to be a deeply biased agenda,” Stewart said in a news release. “The State of Kansas is actively working to silence voices that challenge the status quo, especially those from minority faiths and marginalized communities.”
Stewart told Kansas Reflector that his permit request was “flat out ignored” for a few weeks, and he only got a response after he showed up in person.
In response to a Kansas Reflector request for comment, Department of Administration spokesman Samir Arif pointed to a response Proffitt had given to Stewart.
“The State has increased safety concerns regarding any event occurring on the south steps after sundown, including whether adequate Kansas Highway Patrol resources are available to address these safety concerns after dark,” Proffitt wrote.
In the new release, Stewart said Capitol Police Chief Brandon Bichsel told him he had “no reservations” about the police’s ability to maintain security. Bichsel did not respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
“Additionally, I decline to grant a permission to you, on behalf of the organization, due to improper acts that occurred when a previous permit space on the Statehouse grounds was granted to you for an event that occurred in March 2025,” Proffitt wrote, referencing the black mass.
The permit Stewart obtained for the black mass allowed the Satanic Grotto to protest outside of the Statehouse — but not inside — after Gov. Laura Kelly banned any protests inside the building on the planned day. Before the black mass, Stewart told Kansas Reflector he planned to defy Kelly’s directive.

On the day of the black mass, Stewart entered the Statehouse and began a dedication to Satan. Counter-protesters physically intervened, including Marcus Schroeder — a 21-year-old from Wisconsin who had been charged with making a false bomb threat on a Pride parade. After Schroeder attempted to grab Stewart’s copy of “The Satanic Bible” two times, Stewart punched Schroeder in the face twice, which resulted in both of their arrests.
“Your conduct created a risk to public safety, violated the terms of your permit, and caused injury to another person,” Proffitt wrote.
Shawnee County prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Stewart.
Restrictions didn’t stop Stewart at the last protest. But after his arrest, Stewart said he is hesitant to go forward with his planned “witching hour” event.
“We are going to do everything in our power to ensure the event can take place,” Stewart told Kansas Reflector. “However, after consultation with my criminal lawyer, I’m concerned the state is setting the ground for heavy consequences if we proceed.”
Stewart said he could face 18 months of incarceration if the prosecutors decide to pursue the charges from his black mass arrest. He said that being incarcerated would prevent him from serving the community.
“We aren’t done fighting,” he said. “We stepped up to the plate last time when it came to making a point with our safety and freedom. This time we will find other routes that hopefully illustrate the same points.”
The Department of Administration on July 1 denied Stewart’s request to reconsider its decision.
“Should your organization wish to reserve a space for its event, the ending time cannot go past sundown, and someone other than you must take responsibility for the application and event,” said Pat Doran, chief counsel for the Department of Administration, in an email to Stewart.

Attorneys for the MEDC have until July 11 to determine if they want to appeal a decision issued last week by Oakland District Court Judge James Brady. The judge ruled that Nessel’s office could keep documents it seized in a June 18 raid on the MEDC, the economic development arm of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration.
The Department of Attorney General executed the search warrant after it claimed in court that MEDC stonewalled an ongoing investigation into Global Link International and its owner, businesswoman Fay Beydoun. No charges have been filed against Beydoun, but it is alleged that Beydoun may have misused funds from a legislative grant issued in 2022. The department of attorney general also raided Beydoun’s residence in June, in addition to its search warrant executed on the agency’s offices.
Brady also ruled that if an appeal was not filed by July 11, Nessel’s office could move forward with an independent taint team, which would determine whether documents were privileged or constituted material evidence.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan Advance asked if the MEDC was considering an appeal and if one would be filed by the July 11 deadline. A spokesperson responded by saying the agency had no further comment on the case.
As the investigation waits in limbo, the probe into the $20 million granted to Beydoun in 2022 has caused controversy at all levels of state government.
The grant for Global Link was approved by the Michigan Legislature – which at the time was still under full Republican control – and Whitmer’s office, and Nessel’s probe seeks to learn more about how involved the MEDC might have been in moving the grant along to Beydoun.
The Detroit News was the first to report that Beydoun misused the grant funds for various high priced items, which sparked transparency concerns over Lansing’s earmarks process and has linked Beydoun to Whitmer, who has been described as one of her donors and political appointees.
Court documents show alleged stonewalling from MEDC
According to court documents obtained by the Advance, the attorney general’s office sent an initial documents request to the MEDC in April 2022. The department asked for a copy of the grant application and any other supporting documents, along with a copy of the approved grant.
After some back and forth, the agency provided three documents to the attorney general’s office – the approved grant contract and the application, as well as the budget that approved the grant.
A timeline provided in court documents shows that Beydoun sent a letter to Whitmer that sought to wind down the grant funding in May 2024.
Around that time, the attorney general’s office asked MEDC for additional information and expressed a continuing need for documentation showing the agency’s interactions with Global Link International. The MEDC pledged to continue cooperation.
Still, the department kept asking for more information, including the entirety of the agency’s case file. The MEDC responded but was mum on the request for the case file, but it later sent the department a copy of documents that were requested by The Detroit News.
Meanwhile, investigators in June 2024 received new evidence from a witness unaffiliated with the MEDC. The person allegedly told investigators that the agency had a series of meetings with Beydoun in the summer of 2021 seeking approval for a global business accelerator, which was about a year before the Legislature passed an appropriation for the company.
Michigan House OKs earmark reforms in state budget process

Beydoun was said to have been on the MEDC board that would be in charge of administrating the grant, the witness said. Additionally, the witness provided investigators with documents that were never identified by the MEDC when the attorney general’s office asked for any and all documentation.
One of those documents was an email sent to Trish Foster, the governor’s chief operating officer, in which Beydoun relays that the MEDC approved the appropriation. Both MEDC CEO Quentin Messer and Susan Corbin, director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, were aware of the development, Beydoun added.
Most of the communication between the agency and the attorney general’s office in April and May 2024 was between MEDC counsel Brad Heffner and Special Agent Steve Morse. But, having been provided no other documentation, aside from The Detroit News’ Freedom of Information Act request, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Payok got involved on July 9, 2024.
The same day, Heffner responded to answer questions but provided no additional documentation.
Payok requested a meeting with Heffner and the MEDC staff that worked on the Global Link project. Heffner responded but only offered a meeting with himself and another MEDC attorney, court records show.
In March of 2025, the MEDC officially declared Global Link International in breach of the original grant agreement.
On April 24, one year after the first request, Morse asked MEDC for all invoices and receipts related to the Global Link grant to date. A phone conference commenced shortly thereafter, where Payok and Morse again requested the entire case file and an opportunity to interview non-attorney witnesses who approved Global Link expenses.
Heffner in that phone conference assured the attorney general’s office that he would provide the file and the names of witnesses.
A back and forth ensued throughout the month of May, in which court records show Heffner stalled and promised delivery of the documents until May 15. At that point, Heffner stated that the MEDC would not provide a single name or facilitate a meeting with requested witnesses.
Instead, Heffner said he would be able to provide a process document – one that was modified in the middle of the grant’s lifespan.
Invoices and receipts requested by the attorney general’s office were finally turned over on May 21.
Global Link employees were interviewed in late May, as well, stating that Messer was told Beydoun was operating without oversight and misusing the grant funds. The employee told investigators that Beydoun was a friend and ultimately did nothing with the information.
Court documents filed by the attorney general’s office show that the MEDC, despite initially stating that it was unaware anything was amiss with the Global Link grant, hired an independent criminal defense attorney, Gerald Gleeson of the Miller Canfield law firm, for its own witnesses.
Gleeson did not respond to numerous requests for comments on the case or requests for copies of his own filings in the case.
Raid transcript shows MEDC attorney attempted to conceal evidence
The attorney general’s office raided the MEDC’s offices on June 18.
In an affidavit recounting the events of the raid filed by Special Agent Kyle Kolka, the department had lost trust in the MEDC to provide necessary documents and information, which necessitated the execution of a search warrant.
Kolka stated that Linda Asciutto, chief general counsel to MEDC, called outside counsel when officers arrived at the agency’s Lansing office at around 9 a.m. on June 18. The conversation captured on an audio recording device worn by Kolka involved Asciutto telling MEDC’s attorney that officers were not going to take her files and that she supposed that they could “haul her in” for potentially obstructing them.
She then says that she has to get back up to her office, to which Kolka told Asciutto to stay put in the lobby. Asciutto was allegedly defiant, saying she didn’t need to stay anywhere and stated she was going back to her office.
Asciutto asked to speak with her attorney and asked Kolka to step away for a moment, to which the agent obliged. She later asked Morse to leave her office alone, and maintained that it was off limits. The officers executing the search warrant told her that they needed to look in her office, a move that Asciutto asserted to be “outrageous.” Asciutto also asserted that agents weren’t entitled to “her stuff,” and that officers had to take her at her word where all Global Link documents were held.
Morse, in response, said officers would only seize Global Link related documents, but that they did intend to search Asciutto’s office for those materials.
During conversations between a special agent and an assistant attorney general, it was determined that the department and MEDC’s attorney would work on privilege issues before anything was seized. Asciutto claimed that those documents had already been set aside.
Arguments ensued between Asciutto and officers as they continued to bag and seal documents and take boxes that Asciutto claimed were protected by attorney-client privilege. But despite her protestations that officers were being provided all relevant materials, officers found in Asciutto’s office a purple folder sitting on her desk that had “GLI,” the acronym for Global Link, visible on the first page.
Asciutto claimed that was also a privileged document, as was a three-ring binder marked GLI that was sitting on her floor.
The last page of the affidavit submitted by Kolka notes that, given her reluctance to open her office and the fact that she had relevant material within, it was his conclusion that Asciutto acted to conceal evidence during the search.
Morse also filed a supplemental affidavit in court noting the same conclusion regarding Asciutto.
“At no time did Asciutto ever explain how any document she mentioned was attorney-client privileged, who the clients were, whether the communications were confidential, or whether they contained legal advice,” Morse wrote. “She just continued to make blanket statements about large groups of documents. … Even though MEDC had been preparing a subpoena production for the Legislature that had been redacted, Asciutto never mentioned a privilege log, nor did we find such a log.”
The “subpoena” in question was a formal request for documents and records related to Global Link issued in the form of a letter by state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), chair of the Michigan House Oversight Committee, who is now looking into the grant and MEDC’s involvement. DeBoyer’s request was sent June 5, and the letter was also signed by state Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments.
In the affidavit filed with the district court, Morse noted that had officers not searched Asciutto’s office over her objections, they would not have found the binder, which he said was certainly within the scope of the search warrant.
“Asciutto’s conduct – including telling us that, as an officer of the court, we had everything related to GLI when in fact more related documents were sitting on her desk and clearly in use – indicates that she directly intended to prevent investigators from accessing evidence that we were there to seize under the warrant,” Morse wrote.
Judge allows Nessel’s office to keep documents – for now
On July 1, lawyers for the Department of Attorney General and Gleeson, representing staff members named as witnesses but not targets in the investigation, attempted to argue for and against quashing the search warrant executed on June 18.
Gleeson maintained that many of the documents seized were privileged, and that its work to provide documents to the House Oversight Committee involved a privilege review, according to The Detroit News. 
Meanwhile, Payok argued that the department had no clear indication of what was privileged and what wasn’t, except for writing on some boxes indicating as such – which was noted in the lengthy transcript of the June raid.
Still, Brady ruled that Nessel’s office could keep the evidence collected in the raid and that if MEDC had not appealed his decision by July 11, the department could proceed as planned with a taint team.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 11:08:10.796827

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Northern Iowa will begin offering in-state tuition to students from Iowa’s six border states this fall, with the university’s foundation finding seed money for the program after Gov. Kim Reynolds removed its funding from the proposed state budget.
The Cedar Falls university announced the launch of its Neighboring State Rate Tuesday — a plan that will allow new students from Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin to pay greatly reduced tuition compared to their out-of-state peers. Tuition for these students, pending Iowa Board of Regents approval at the end of the month, will be set at $10,201 for the fall — a rate matching the one approved for in-state, undergraduate students.
“This is an exciting development for students and their families across the region,” UNI President Mark Nook said in a statement. “We anticipate that UNI’s Neighboring State Rate will attract even more talented students to our campus to take advantage of the wide variety of academic programs we offer, at an even more affordable price.

Funding to the tune of $1.5 million for the new tuition rate program was included in education appropriations legislation passed this spring, but Reynolds line-item vetoed the allocation before signing the bill into law.
In her veto letter, Reynolds cited questions about how current students would fall under the tuition change and the “expectation of ongoing funding” as reasons for striking out the appropriation. UNI originally requested $3 million in one-time funding for the program, she said in the letter, but later changed the ask to $1.5 million with the hope of future state funding.
University spokesperson Pete Moris said in an interview the UNI Foundation, the university’s fundraising branch, will provide $1.5 million to start the program this year, filling the gap left by lowered tuition rates. Students will pay around $12,000 less annually through the new tuition program than they would with traditional nonresident rates, he said.
After the veto, Moris said university staff and leadership believed the program should still get started as soon as possible, as it will take longer than the month and some change before school starts to see its full impact.
“We really need a full recruiting cycle to put this into play and to start spreading that message into those six states and getting the word out,” Moris said.
There are currently 467 students attending UNI from Iowa’s contiguous states, Moris said, with almost 75% of the group hailing from Illinois or Minnesota. South Dakota has the smallest representation of the group, with only six students. South Dakota has a statewide nonresident tuition program of its own with 10 states, Iowa included.
Nonresident undergraduate students who don’t qualify for the UNI program will pay $22,359 for the 2025-2026 academic year, a 3% increase from last year. This rate, as well as rates for all other groups of students at UNI, are the lowest in the state for public universities.
“We really think that this is something that’s going to be a benefit from the state of Iowa in terms of attracting new folks to the state to help meet some of our workforce needs, but also for UNI,” Moris said. “The students from different places we have adds to the vibrancy of our campus and the experience for our students.”

On July 4, Nory Sontay Ramos stepped off a flight from San Antonio into a country she hardly recognized: Guatemala.
The summer wasn’t supposed to start this way. The 17-year-old had plans. In early June, she wrapped up 11th grade on a high note, having made the honor roll and represented her Los Angeles high school in the city finals for track. With track season over, she turned her attention to cross-country, showing up to campus for practice after the school year ended.
Everything changed when she and her mother, Estela Ramos — both undocumented — appeared at what they thought was a standard check-in visit with immigration officials on June 30.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

“ICE took us to a room, and they ended up telling my mom, ‘Your case is over, so we have to take you guys with us,’” Sontay Ramos told The 19th. Over the objections of their attorney, federal agents led them away.
The next day, she and her mother were shipped to Texas. And by July 4, they were on a plane to Guatemala, a country where neither of them have lived for over a decade. On Independence Day — an occasion associated with freedom, with hope — their American dream shattered. Sontay Ramos has no idea what will become of the friends, family members and school community her deportation forced her to leave behind in Los Angeles.
A lawyer hired after she and her mother were detained said Monday that a motion to reopen the case has been filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals but provided no other information to The 19th.
A year shy of becoming a high school graduate in the United States, the teen’s life — and opportunities — completely changed in the span of five days.
“I’m confused,” Sontay Ramos said, her voice breaking. “I don’t know. I’m just really sad about everything.”

President Donald Trump campaigned for a return to office with the promise of mass deportations, characterizing undocumented immigrants as criminals and threats to women and girls. But as his administration has ramped up enforcement of his policy priority, undocumented people with no criminal backgrounds have made up the largest share of immigrants targeted. Those who are pursuing legal status through the proper channels have also become vulnerable — showing up to check-ins, like Sontay Ramos and her mother — only to be detained. These developments, recent polls reveal, have led to public disapproval of the Trump administration’s strategies.
Civil liberties and advocacy groups have raised concerns that undocumented immigrants are being removed so quickly they have been denied the right to due process. With Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act directing $150 billion more toward mass deportations, expedited removals of undocumented immigrants will almost certainly increase — and those immigrants who arrived in the United States as children like Sontay Ramos stand to get caught in the middle.

The Trump administration deported more than 93,800 people from January 20 to June 11, with ICE more than doubling its arrests compared with the same period in 2024, revealed an analysis by the Washington Post based on information from the Deportation Data Project. (The data does not reflect arrest and removal numbers from Customs and Border Protection.) Of those, 61% did not have criminal records and almost 90 percent were men, underscoring how relatively uncommon it is for a mother and daughter to be removed.
The Trump administration has not provided a tally of how many minors have been deported this year, but The 19th’s review of figures from the Deportation Data Project found that only about 3% of removals involved children. When ICE targets juveniles, the incidents often make national headlines, such as when a 9-year-old boy and his father living in Torrance, California, were detained in May and swiftly deported to Honduras. In states including Michigan, Massachusetts and New York, the detainment of teenagers, including those who are technically legal adults, have also garnered widespread media attention this year.
But when Sontay Ramos and her mother exited their Guatemala-bound flight on Friday, they weren’t met with fanfare. None of their family members in the Central American nation knew to expect them. With the help of an internet connection, they managed to contact one of Sontay Ramos’ older sisters, with whom they’re now living. The teenager isn’t sure which part of Guatemala she’s in, though she describes the area as rural.
Just 6 when she left Guatemala, Sontay Ramos struggles to recall what life there was like. But she remembers the emotion she felt as a small child: fear.
“I was scared because there’s gangsters here, and they tried to kill my mom,” she said. A family member involved in a gang threatened her mother, once attacking her so badly she needed to be hospitalized, she said. “My mom was scared.”
A study exploring the root causes of immigration from Guatemala from 2012 to 2019 found violence, poverty, climate change and corruption to be among the driving factors and that many such migrants hail from rural parts of the country.
“The two major reasons, especially if we look at families, have to do with violence and drought,” said David Leblang, a coauthor of that study and politics professor at the University of Virginia.  “It has been drought and then flood, hurricane and then drought that has just decreased the ability for families to put food on the table, so you see a combination of economic insecurity, but more so for families, food insecurity — because when you can’t feed your kids, that’s when families are going to pick up and they’re going to move first to more urban areas and then out of the country.”
About 11 years ago, Sontay Ramos and her mother headed by car to the United States in search of safety and opportunity. There, other family members awaited them and they hoped to be granted asylum, she said.
The transition was not easy. They left behind three of Sontay Ramos’ older siblings who did not want to come to the United States, she said. Her father remained in Guatemala, too. His death from illness shortly after she moved away was devastating.
“Unfortunately, her dad passed away at a young age, just like two weeks after her arrival to the States,” recalled Jennifer Ramos, Sontay Ramos’ 22-year-old cousin who lives in Los Angeles. “She grew up with her dad, so that also hit her at such a young age, just coming to a new country at 6 years old and not knowing the language here and losing her father. It was definitely hard for her.”
Getting accustomed to life in Los Angeles also wasn’t easy. Sontay Ramos and her mother are Indigenous Guatemalans, fluent in K’iché. Few resources in their native tongue made assimilation more challenging in a city where English and Spanish are the primary languages.
Jennifer Ramos helped her little cousin learn to speak English. “She would come over, and I would help her with her homework. When she first came to the States, my younger sister was kind of her only friend in school because she didn’t know anybody and, again, the language barrier. She actually does struggle speaking Spanish.”
In time, Sontay Ramos and her mother adjusted to life in California. Her mother ultimately became a garment worker, employed as a seamstress until physical setbacks — illness and surgery — sidelined her earlier this year. Her deportation has separated her from her life partner, with whom she and her daughter shared an apartment in the Westlake District of Los Angeles, the neighborhood where an ICE raid at a Home Depot close to an elementary school in June panicked families, and days of demonstrations in nearby downtown escalated after Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines.

Los Angeles is a deeply blue city in a liberal state, with the nation’s highest concentration of immigrants — a place that the president has made ground zero for his immigration raids. In November, the city council voted unanimously to make L.A. a sanctuary city, which bars it from using resources for immigration enforcement. Last week, the Trump administration filed suit, challenging the policy. Meanwhile, advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and Public Counsel are suing the Trump administration for what it describes as a pattern of federal violations during immigration raids in Greater Los Angeles.
Before Trump’s immigration policies roiled her neighborhood and upended her life, Sontay Ramos was indistinguishable from her peers born in the United States. She grew up on the Netflix shows “Stranger Things” and “Cobra Kai,” enjoys the music of Lana Del Rey and The Weeknd and dotes on her cat, Max, who turned 1on May 15. He is black — one of her two favorite colors. In her spare time, Sontay Ramos practices taekwondo, which she’s been learning for nearly four years.
“I just liked it,” she said of the martial art. Knowing how to fight, she added, helps her feel protected.
Sontay Ramos never sensed she was in danger before the immigration check-in that would push her out of the United States.
But her cousin Jennifer Ramos worried. The night before, Ramos’ father invited the family over to have Sunday dinner with his wife and three daughters. The evening was largely festive. Her father made shrimp ceviche and was eager for his family to enjoy the tangy, citrusy dish — especially Estela Ramos, who had just celebrated her 45th birthday. But when Estela mentioned that she and her daughter had an immigration check-in scheduled, everyone fell quiet.
“We were kind of scared,” Jennifer Ramos said. “We were like, ‘Are you sure you should go?’”
But her aunt tried to reassure them by letting them know their lawyer said it would be fine. After all, they had shown up for previous check-ins without incident, and if they didn’t appear, immigration officials would just find them at home.
Now, Jennifer Ramos doesn’t know when she’ll see her aunt and cousin again.
“It is unfair that a young student like her has been detained,” she said. “She’s the most deserving person. This should be the least of her worries.”

Sontay Ramos couldn’t help but tear up when she described what she was looking forward to about senior year — graduation, her friends, track-and-field and cross-country.
Although excited to reunite with family members they hadn’t seen in years, she and her mother have been weeping off and on since they arrived in Guatemala.
“I was happy, but I was expecting to see them in another way,” she said of her relatives. “Not like this.”
Sleeping and eating have been tough as has the constant feeling of disorientation. She doesn’t know where she is. In K’iche’, she asked her mother for the name of the town they’re in, but it didn’t register.
She also continues to feel blindsided about why she and her mother were deported at all. She doesn’t understand how or why their case was closed.
Recent polls, particularly those conducted after the immigration raids in Los Angeles, reveal that the Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdowns may be unpopular with the majority of the public. A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll released July 1 found that just 43 percent of Americans support Trump’s tactics.
Sixty-four percent of registered voters support giving most undocumented immigrants in the United States a pathway to legal status, with 31 percent preferring deportation for most of them, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released June 26. Six months ago, only 55 percent of voters supported giving unauthorized immigrants a path to legal status, while 36 percent backed deportation.
Leblang, the politics professor, said that ultimately the economy will sway the public to take a stand on immigration.
“All of those people who are being deported, they’re consuming goods that are produced by natives,” he said. “So, what the evidence suggests is that’s going to affect native workers’ wages, so across the board, this is going to have a negative effect on the economy.”
For Manuel Guevara — a physical education teacher and coach at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, where Sontay Ramos is enrolled as a student — immigration isn’t an economic issue but a personal one. He came to the United States at 11 months old in the mid-1980s during El Salvador’s horrific 12-year civil war, becoming a citizen as a teenager. He fears that more deportations of youth from his school are imminent. He knows some families skipped school graduations in the area due to their concerns over raids. Some are so worried they refuse to let their children attend football practice. He’s heard that other families intend to self deport.


Let us know what you think...


 

“This is not normal,” Guevara said. “Our whole community is beyond vulnerable. A lot of [students’] parents, sad to say, don’t know how to read and write. Their kids need to do that for them. If they’re presented with [immigration] paperwork, they might not even be able to read it because that’s not their primary language.”
He can hardly believe that Sontay Ramos, whom he taught for most of her high school years, is gone.
“She was smiling, happy-go-lucky,” Guevara said. He’s astounded that she was detained and deported in less than a week. “Nory is going into her senior year, which is another thing that’s just killing me. She was going into her senior year with all this momentum.”
Guevara fondly recalled the teen’s high-pitched voice that gets even higher when she’s excited.
“You could tell when she’s coming from down the hallway, for sure,” he said. But her trademark voice is now subdued due to her deportation ordeal. Through tears, she expressed gratitude for how her teachers, classmates and other supporters have donated nearly $7,000 to her GoFundMe campaign.
“I just want to thank everybody for the support and tell them to just be safe out there and be strong no matter what’s going to happen,” she said.
If she can’t return to the United States, she will figure out how to finish her education in Guatemala, Sontay Ramos said.
Guevara is certain she has the aptitude for greatness. Her academics and extracurricular activities are just hints of what she’s capable of, he said.
“She was about to reach cruising altitude,” he said. “Some of our students are capable of reaching the clouds up there and doing some great things. And I really believe that she was on her way.”

The state's highest court says a law enforcement officer can't claim reasonable suspicion a violation of law was occurring simply because a license plate was difficult to read. (Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court reversed the drug-trafficking conviction of an Illinois-tagged motorist linked to evidence seized from a vehicle stopped by Geary County law enforcement merely because the frame around a license plate obstructed part of the state’s name.
The unanimous Supreme Court noted Kansas statute didn’t require a state’s name on license plates to be clearly legible. The justices agreed partial obstruction of a word on the out-of-state plate at the center of this case couldn’t provide a Kansas law enforcement officer the opportunity to formulate reasonable suspicion that a crime was or would occur to warrant a traffic stop.
This saga began in March 2021 when Geary County sheriff’s deputy Bradley Rose pulled over motorist Brian Beck on Interstate 70 near Junction City because he noticed half of the word “Illinois” couldn’t be easily read on the tag.
Rose nevertheless called in Beck’s tag to dispatch as “Illinois Charles John 14442” before stepping out of his cruiser, the Supreme Court opinion said. Rose said at trial Beck appeared “extremely nervous,” was breathing deeply during the traffic stop and admitted to being lost. The deputy decided that was enough to detain Beck and call in a drug dog.
During the canine inspection, the animal alerted to possible presence of illegal drugs. The vehicle search revealed a satchel with 2.1 pounds of methamphetamine. At one point, Beck tried to flee the scene but was arrested.
Geary County District Judge Courtney Boehm, an appointee of Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer, rejected the defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search. Beck was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute, failure to purchase a drug tax stamp and interference with a law enforcement officer.
Beck, 56, was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison and was at Winfield Correctional Facility when the Supreme Court’s decision was handed down. A Kansas Department of Corrections spokesman said the agency wouldn’t release inmates until a court forwarded necessary paperwork to the prison.
In 2024, a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed Beck’s convictions based on a belief Beck’s license plate wasn’t clearly visible as required.
Beck filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, which concluded the Geary County judge applied an improper legal standard for deciding whether law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to justify a stop and search. The justices likewise concluded the Court of Appeals reached the wrong determination on suppression of evidence.
“We reject the analytic framework adopted by the lower courts and their conclusions of law,” the Supreme Court decision said.
The Supreme Court opinion authored by Justice Eric Rosen wiped Beck’s convictions off the books and sent the case back to district court to determine whether the deputy had “constitutionally valid grounds for making the stop and seizure.”
The high court’s 13-page opinion could serve as a roadmap for Geary County’s reexamination of available evidence in the Beck case.
“No statute requires displaying the Kansas state name anywhere other than on the registration decal, where it may be abbreviated,” said Rosen, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. “It places no such requirement on anything else printed on a license plate, whether it is an ‘I’m Pet Friendly’ logo or a state name.”
The Supreme Court’s decision could offer relief to thousands of drivers in Kansas who installed or left in place brackets on license plates and unwittingly opened themselves to traffic stops, drug-dog searches and seizures by law enforcement.
Supreme Court Justice Dan Biles, who also was appointed by Sebelius, was among members of the Supreme Court perplexed by willingness of the lower courts to broaden license plate regulation in a way that threatened motorists with a fine up to $2,500 or a jail sentence ranging from 30 days to six months.
“There are a lot of frames that cover up half of the word ‘Kansas’ — a lot,” Biles said during oral argument of the case in November. “Anyone driving with that frame is subject to six months in jail? Is that where we’re at with the state’s position on this and this Court of Appeals’ decision?”
“I believe that’s what the statute says,” said Kansas assistant solicitor general Ethan Zipf-Sigler, who unsuccessfully fought to sustain the verdict against Beck.
Biles said the court record in the case was troubling because of assertions license plates in Kansas had to be clearly legible to a law enforcement officer located a safe distance from a targeted vehicle.
“I’m really struck by how arbitrary the enforcement aspect is,” Biles said. “I can’t help but think the state is adding words to a statute that we don’t get to do.”
Attorney Kasper Schirer, senior assistant appellate defender, argued on Beck’s behalf before the Supreme Court and said the traffic stop was unlawful from the outset.
“When no law has been violated, when no traffic law has been violated, the Fourth Amendment does not allow for suspicionless seizures,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Biles-afternoon-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-08 10:09:22.281391

Anglers will no longer need reservations to surf fish at most of Delaware’s drive-on beaches starting Saturday, July 12, under a major change announced by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
The new policy eliminates weekend and holiday reservation requirements at seven beaches that rarely reach full capacity during peak times.
“As surf tag holders have gotten used to the reservation system, we know from customer feedback that many people like the predictability of knowing they will have a spot and won’t be turned away or have to wait in a long line for someone to leave,” DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson said. “At the same time, DNREC has certainly heard that some anglers, especially locals, like to wake up on a sunny day and decide to get out on the beach. With this change, we will provide different approaches for different types of visitors.”
The affected beaches include Key Box, Conquest, and Faithful Steward at Delaware Seashore State Park; York, Middle, and South beaches at Fenwick Island State Park; and Beach Plum Island north of Lewes.
Altogether, the changes affect nearly 64% of the state’s drive-on surf fishing beach availability.
The reservations are dropped for seven of 12 drive-on beaches.
“Drive-on surf fishing reached record levels in recent years, and our parks have tried different ways to balance what can be overwhelming demand with the recreational experience so many enjoy,” said Matt Ritter, director of the Division of Parks and Recreation. “Reservations have become prevalent at state and national parks across the country, and as we evolve our reservation program in Delaware State Parks, we remain committed to providing a good experience for anglers and all our visitors.”
DNREC officials said the decision follows a two-year review of surf fishing data and visitor feedback.
“After careful consideration, we felt making the change to drop reservation requirements for several surf fishing beaches was the right decision,” Ritter said.
Despite rising interest in drive-on surf fishing in recent years, the affected beaches have typically not reached capacity, except during major holidays like the Fourth of July.
Reservations will still be required on summer weekends and holidays for five high-demand locations: Gordons Pond, Herring Point, Navy Crossing, and Point Crossing at Cape Henlopen State Park, and 3 R’s at Delaware Seashore State Park.
Those reservations will remain in effect between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
The reservation system was introduced in 2023 to reduce crowding and manage traffic flow during peak beach use. While it helped prevent congestion at certain popular sites, many beachgoers expressed frustration—especially locals who prefer spontaneous trips based on weather.
Reservations for the remaining restricted beaches will continue to open each week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Anglers must hold a valid 1-year or 2-year surf fishing permit and are limited to one reservation per day. Weekday access without a reservation is still available with an off-peak permit.
DNREC said it will monitor how the new system impacts beach usage and may consider temporary reinstatement of reservations around high-demand holidays like the Fourth of July.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SurfFishing.7.7.25.jpg,,,2025-07-08 10:09:22.281391

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Department of Justice is asking an appellate court to let Florida enforce its illegal entry and re-entry law.
At issue is an anti-illegal immigration law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in February, which prompted the arrest of a U.S. citizen from Georgia and led to a federal judge finding the state’s chief legal officer in civil contempt of court.
The federal government intervened on Monday, filing a brief stating that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams erred in her temporary block on the enforcement of SB 4C, the law that makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

“Florida’s law is in harmony, not conflict, with federal law,” the brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit states.
Florida lawmakers passed the law during a special session earlier this year to align the state with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Uthmeier already tried to get the appellate court to rescind the bar on the law, but it refused. The Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state in April.
Both Williams in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida and the Eleventh Circuit ruled that federal law likely preempts the state law.
Four months into his appointment by DeSantis as attorney general, Uthmeier faced Williams’ contempt ruling for his disobedience of her order to call off enforcement of SB 4C. Florida Highway Patrol and local police arrested dozens after the court order on April 4, including a 20-year-old U.S. citizen in Leon County.
Two arrests
The first biweekly report of arrests that Williams ordered Uthmeier to submit in her contempt ruling shows that St. Johns County arrested two men on counts of illegal entry on May 29.
Uthmeier, DeSantis’ former chief of staff, has also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in, submitting an application to Justice Clarence Thomas on June 17 to remove the bar on SB 4C’s enforcement.
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs wrote to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the state hadn’t proved that the block on the law caused it irreparable harm.
“Florida of course has a wide range of nonimmigration criminal laws to address violent crime and drug trafficking, as well as myriad other crimes, and nothing in the injunction remotely limits the enforcement of those laws,” the response states. “Indeed, enforcing Florida’s preempted state immigration regime will harm public safety by eroding community trust in law enforcement.”

Deborah Ross read to children at Raleigh Nursery School in 2024 as part of an event designed to raise support for better public funding for child care programs. (Photo: Lynn Bonner)An early education task force appointed by Governor Josh Stein earlier this year called for raising minimum child care subsidies in its initial report issued last month.
The panel, announced in March as the state seeks to rejuvenate a child care industry battered by COVID-19 and the rising cost of living, released its first report on June 30 after three discussions on potential solutions. Members recommended a statewide child care subsidy reimbursement rate floor and also outlined additional avenues for officials to explore, including greater benefits for child care workers — including free or subsidized child care — as well as partnerships with North Carolina public schools and universities and the establishment of a state child care endowment.
“Our state’s child care system faces significant challenges associated with access, early childhood education workforce recruitment and retention, and affordability,” the report reads. “Many of North Carolina’s child care programs struggle to stay in business due to difficulty retaining teachers and staff. With the average cost of infant care for just one child reaching $11,720 and surpassing the cost of in-state tuition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, high-quality child care is financially out of reach for many families.”
  Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt (Photo: Office of the Lt. Governor)
Task force members, led by co-chairs Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt and Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), noted that despite these high costs, many child care facilities in the state operate on razor-thin margins, with some like a family child care home in Cleveland County running at a loss. Tuition, the task force found, is both inadequate to cover staff wages, supplies, and operating costs and also too expensive for a large portion of families in the state. And that is while pay for child care professionals is too low to maintain a stable work force, with the report placing the average starting salary for early education professionals at just $14 per hour.

These shortfalls translate to a major economic detriment for North Carolina, according to the report. According to an analysis by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the lack of adequate child care in North Carolina costs the state’s economy $5.65 billion per year, in large part due to parents leaving the work force to take on full-time child care responsibilities.
To address these issues, the task force recommended standardizing the minimum amount that child care providers are reimbursed for their care by the state. Currently, state law sets the child care subsidy reimbursement rate at the 75th percentile of a county’s market rate, calculated based on age of the child, star rating of the program, and care setting, yielding more than 3,000 different rates across the state — a formulation that the report finds underfunds care programs in rural counties, providing them thousands less than nearby urban counties.
“All counties that currently receive reimbursement at rates below the floor amount would receive the floor amount instead, while counties that currently receive a rate above the floor would continue to receive child care subsidy reimbursement at their current rates,” the report recommends. “Without an increase in subsidy reimbursement rates for child care centers in rural communities, many are at risk of closing.”
The remainder of the recommendations issued were primarily exploratory in nature, in essence setting an agenda for the task force’s upcoming work. They include researching non-salary benefits that could aid in child care worker retention, looking at partnerships with the University of North Carolina system and other public education institutions in the state, and considering the creation of a public-private child care endowment to help families across the state afford child care, such as those instituted in Nebraska and Connecticut.

(Image provided by Ben Jones/University of Alaska Fairbanks)A lightning-sparked fire that has burned about 2,000 acres of Arctic Alaska tundra is the biggest wildfire on the North Slope in eight years.
The Ikpikpuk Fire, which bears the name of a 195-mile river that flows north into the Arctic Ocean, was discovered on June 22. Though classified as active, it is unstaffed, meaning that there are no efforts underway to fight it. Also burning nearby in the same treeless tundra area is the 618-acre Bronx Fire, along with two small fires of a few acres each.
The North Slope fires were detected by satellite, said Beth Ipsen, a spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
The Ikpikpuk Fire is the biggest North Slope tundra fire since 2017, when the Ketik River fire east of Wainwright burned 2,870 acres, said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In all, 5,421 acres of North Slope tundra were reported as burned in 2017, Thoman said.
Fires occasionally burn in the North Slope tundra when the weather is hot enough, the plants are dry enough and there is lightning to start them, but they are typically very small, Thoman said.
The Ikpikpuk Fire stands out, he said. “A 2,000-acre fire is non-trivial for the North Slope,” he said.
And conditions have been right for a significant fire in the region, he said. “Certainly, it has been extremely warm on the inland North Slope,” he said.
While most Alaska tundra fires are south of the Brooks Range, in Northwest or Western Alaska, fires north of the Brooks Range are becoming more common and bigger, according to scientists.
The frequency of significant wildfires fires on the North Slope tundra has tripled in recent years, according to a 2023 study by scientists from the BLM and UAF. The study evaluated lightning-sparked fires of at least 10 hectares (24.7 acres) that have burned on the North Slope over half a century, from 1972 to 2022. In the first 37 years of that study period, there was an annual average of 0.89 such fires, but in the last 13 years of the study period, the annual average jumped to 2.5, the study found.
Their increasing frequency is a product of climate change, and tundra fires also contribute to climate change because they hasten the release of old carbon stored in the ground, scientists say.
The biggest North Slope tundra fire on record is the 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire, which burned about 256,000 acres and resulted in significant permafrost thaw and the release into the atmosphere of 50 years’ worth of stored carbon, according to scientists from UAF and other universities.
And the mix of plants that grew back in the decade since that fire is different from that in the unburned area, creating more potential fuel for future wildfires, according to a separate BLM study.
For Alaska wildfire managers, the Ikpikpuk Fire and the others on the North Slope are of scientific interest but of low priority for any action, Ipsen said.
“We’ve got a lot going on throughout the state,” she said.
Wildfires have erupted since the second half of June, when Interior temperatures soared high enough to prompt Alaska’s first-ever National Weather Service heat advisories.
A series of fires have spurred evacuations or evacuation alerts in communities along Alaska’s road system, Ipsen said. She named the area between Nenana and Fairbanks, where two fires grouped together as the Nenana Ridge Complex, have been burning on either side of the Parks Highway. North Star Borough residents are on evacuation alert Monday for a different set of fires. And Healy, Tok and Delta Junction are other communities that have been affected by nearby wildfires, Ipsen said.
“We’re talking about really close to people and properties, and it’s all happening pretty much simultaneously,” she said.
In all, over 581,000 acres have burned in Alaska from 363 fires as of Monday afternoon, with 227 of those fires classified as active, according to the federal-state Alaska Interagency Coordination Center.
That includes four new fires discovered in the Kobuk area of Northwest Alaska, potentially affecting the village of Ambler, Ipsen said.
Thoman said he is not surprised by those Kobuk area fires because the region has been extraordinarily hot in recent days. He cited temperature readings above 90 degrees for three consecutive days at an airstrip north of Kobuk.
“It can get hot there, but three days in a row in the lower 90s — that is really remarkable,” he said.

The end of a temporary exemption to a state law requiring many employers to classify their independent contractors as employees is leading some nail technicians to say they are being targeted by a policy that lawmakers intended to protect them, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
California has over 6,000 nail establishments, and from 1987 to 2023, the number of licensed manicurists in the state tripled to over 125,000. In lieu of being an employee at a salon who earns an hourly wage, nearly a third are independent contractors with flexible hours and rates.
But in 2019, California passed Assembly Bill 5, a sweeping law mandating stricter worker classification rules in an effort to curb unfair labor practices within the gig economy. The law carved out an exemption for nail technicians, which ended this year on Jan. 1. Since then, some nail technicians have found themselves in a legal grey area where doing their job risks violating state labor rules. 
Because other beauty professions, such as hairstylists, have been exempt from AB 5, salon owners and some manicurists say that singling out the nail industry — which in California is predominantly made up of Vietnamese-born women — in the law is discriminatory. 

Emily Micelli, an independent manicurist at a salon in Newport Beach: “I hope the government doesn’t force us to go into something where I have to comply with a salon. I consider myself a nail artist.”

But Lorena Gonzalez, the former San Diego Assemblymember who authored AB 5 and now serves as president of the California Labor Federation, said that lawmakers at the time found “more complaints specifically about misclassification and more findings about misclassification in manicurists than overall cosmetology.”
In 2013, state labor regulators accused one Southern California nail salon chain of misclassifying its workers as independent contractors instead of employees, based on how much control it had over manicurists’ hours and work. The state lost, and the chain is one of several other businesses suing the state over the 2019 law.

What really happens after a worksite immigration raid

As President Donald Trump’s administration carries out what it describes as the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, federal officials have touted that deporting immigrants who do not have legal status will protect American jobs. 
But what really happens after a workplace immigration raid — such as the one that took place last month at an L.A. garment factory — and does deporting immigrants really help raise wages?
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara and Jeanne explain, in June a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said “worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard … economic stability.” Last year on the campaign trail, Trump also inaccurately told a crowd in North Carolina that “every job produced in this country over the last two years has gone to illegal aliens.”
Studies have found, however, that raids can deflate wages and do little for American workers — many of whom rely on services that stem from low-wage, undocumented labor. Raids also tend to lead to more job turnover, and employers are no more likely to use immigration verification tools during hiring. Losing workers also shrinks the local economy, with one study estimating that mass deportations could cost California’s economy $275 billion.

Does police education bill go too far — or not far enough?


Then-San Francisco Police Chief William Scott addresses recruits in the Police Academy in San Francisco on Oct. 2, 2024. Photo by Jessica Christian, San Francisco Chronicle via AP




With no votes in opposition so far, a bill that would set new education requirements for police officers is breezing through the Legislature — yet the measure continues to draw criticism from both criminal justice reform advocates and some law enforcement groups, report CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Adam Echelman.
The bill would require incoming officers, with some exceptions, to receive either an associate degree, bachelor’s degree or policing certificate, which can be obtained from an accredited college or university. The degrees would not have to be related to law enforcement. 
Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a former Los Angeles Assemblymember who authored a 2020 law to raise some police education requirements, said the new proposal leaves a big loophole that allows one to sidestep the education requirement with prior military or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
And while many law enforcement agencies back the bill, representatives from some law enforcement unions argue the measure goes too far, and would worsen the reported statewide police shortage. Said the president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association: The new requirements “would be catastrophic to staffing.”

Harold Williams Jr., Retired Chief Master Sergeant of the US Air Force, passed away on his family farm in Vermont at 1000L on March 25th, 2025 at 83 years wise. Sonny was born in Mount Union, PA; he was the first born of the late Harold Williams Sr. and the late Mattie Lee Moore -Williams-Faulkner. Harold chose to spend his youth with his late great-grandmother Stella “Red” Sanders, who raised him from the time he was 10 years old.
Heavily influenced by his first grade teacher Mrs. Rudy, Harold graduated from Captain Jack Joint Senior High School in Mount Union in May of 1959. He was close with Shirley Ruth (Vaughn) Cook and Wallace “Mike” Green.
After working a few odd jobs in town, better than two cents a pound for picking beans, he entered military service in July 1960. He traveled the US from Pittsburgh and Coraopolis, to Baltimore, to DC, to Denver, and New Mexico. He traveled the world from Panama, to Italy, to Vietnam, to Turkey, and Germany. Harold retired in September 1993 with 30 years and 29 days of active service.


After retirement, Harold settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, volunteering for the Montessori School on Jonestown Rd. and as a teacher’s aide for the first through third grades in the Paxtonia Elementary School.
In 1995, Harold worked as an expeditor (a glorified stock hand according to him) for Hecht Co. in the Harrisburg East Mall. Starting in January 1998 he was employed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Consumer Services, as an Interviewer, Utility Termination Investigator, retiring as a Utility Complaints Investigator in July 2013.
Besides his mother and father, and maternal great-grandmother, Harold was preceded in death by his stepfather, William T. Faulkner, a son, choreographer and dancer Leonard M. Wylliams; three sisters Jean L. Faulkner, JoAnn Faulkner, and Carol Ann Williams (Faulkner); five brothers, George W. “Trot” Faulkner, Oscar “Petey” Faulkner, Edward L. “Eddie” Faulkner, James W. “Jimmy” Williams, and Kenneth L. “Hussel” Faulkner.
Harold leaves to celebrate his life his wife Elizabeth Barrow-Williams, of Harrisburg PA; two daughters, Kimberly M. Williams-Howbert (Shawn), and Dana Y. Williams of Denver, CO; one son, Tyler E. Williams (Titan) of Groton, VT; a grandson Sirwestly H.

Irwin Pensack, 98, passed away on June 23, 2025 at Maple Ridge Memory Care in Essex, Vermont. Up until the time of his passing, his daughter Debbie was by his side, accompanied by family friend Edith. Irwin was born in Newark, NJ on July 8, 1926. He married Judith Fischler on April 11, 1954. They lived in Croton-on-Hudson, NY, and moved to Hartsdale, then Scarsdale, NY as their family grew. Irwin and Judy settled in Florida to enjoy a more relaxing lifestyle but moved back up north to Vermont to be close to family as Irwin’s battle with dementia progressed.
Irwin was a proud patriotic citizen who believed in democracy and preserving civil rights for people of all religions, races and genders. When he was just 17, Irwin enlisted in the army and served in the Army Air Corp until he was honorably discharged. He attended Clarkson University, NYU and Patterson College, achieving a Master’s Degree in Audiology. Throughout his career as an audiologist, Irwin was able to bring the gift of hearing to countless men, women and children, and was continually astounded at the hardships endured by the hard of hearing.
Irwin was the life of the party. He loved a good joke and he was always up for an adventure, enthusiastically jumping in to any escapade. He was a perpetual student, taking wind-surfing lessons, tennis and ski lessons and even music lessons well into his 80s. He had a warm smile for everyone he encountered, whether it was a new acquaintance, an old friend or a family member. He was a kind and approachable man, always ready to listen and try to help plot a path to resolve a problem or offer life guidance.
Irwin is survived by his son Lawrence M. Pensack and his wife, Meredith Pensack of Newton, Massachusetts; his daughter Deborah P. Volk and her husband, Paul S. Volk of Richmond, Vermont; and his son Brian D. Pensack and his wife, Sonia Robles of Petaluma, California. Irwin is survived by his three cherished grandchildren, Amanda Pensack, Danielle Pensack and Ian Volk, as well as many nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews and cousins, all of whom he enjoyed spending time with and loved deeply. Irwin was a down-to-earth, self-effacing man who was incredulous that people loved him so greatly. Shows of affection would often move him to tears. We will miss him dearly.
The family extends a very special thanks to Edith Wilkerson who made Irwin’s life in Vermont very special.

Research shows worksite immigration raids can depress local economies as people stay home and stop spending money. So far, they aren’t known to free up jobs for citizens.


Carlos was pulled out of a deep sleep by a series of frantic phone calls one Friday morning in June. By the time he arrived at a downtown Los Angeles garment factory sometime after 10 a.m., his brother was in chains. 
Agents from a constellation of federal agencies descended on the Ambiance Apparel factory and storefront on June 6, detaining dozens of people. It was the first salvo of the Trump administration’s prolonged engagement in Southern California, where masked federal agents are filmed daily pulling people off the street as part of the largest deportation program in American history.  
Carlos’ brother, Jose, 35, was shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles. Carlos watched as agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement vests led Jose and 13 other garment workers into a waiting white Sprinter van. Carlos hasn’t seen his brother since, though he did confirm that Jose is being held at an immigration detention center in Adelanto. 
“We had just lost our other brother, he died,“ said Carlos, whom CalMatters is only identifying by his first name because of his own fears of deportation. “Then, for our family, losing Jose, it was like someone died again.”
Worksite raids like the one at Ambiance are an attention-grabbing component of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, one that it remains committed to despite a brief reversal in mid-June. They’re unfolding across the state, from Los Angeles’s Fashion District to farm fields in the San Joaquin Valley and a restaurant in San Diego.
While one stated purpose of worksite raids is to remove illegal competition from the labor marketplace, the reality is far messier: Studies have found that immigration raids don’t do much to raise wages – and actually deflate them. Even after a raid, employers are no more likely to use federal immigration verification tools like E-Verify during hiring. 
Nevertheless, on the campaign trail, Trump focused on the threat of illegal competition as the political and emotional lynchpin of his deportation plans.
“They’re taking your jobs, they’re taking your jobs,” Trump told a crowd in Wilmington, N.C., on Sept. 21. “ Every job produced in this country over the last two years has gone to illegal aliens, every job, think of it.
“We’re going to save you. We’re going to save you. We’re going to save you.” 
Every new job between 2022-2024 was not, in fact, filled by undocumented immigrants. Studies show actually deporting workers en masse from industries that rely on undocumented labor does little for U.S. workers. Giovanni Peri, a UC Davis economist who has studied the economic impacts of deportations in the 1930s and during the Obama administration, has found doing so actually reduces job opportunities for American-born workers. 
That’s in part because many American workers, even those outside of immigrant-heavy industries, rely on the services generated by low-wage, undocumented labor — the costs of which would rise with mass deportations. 
“Losing some of these workers and jobs that Americans are moving out of, it shrinks the local economy and there’s a reduction in jobs for Americans,” he said.
There is no evidence, Peri said, that in the face of mass deportations, immigrant-heavy industries would raise their wages to hire American workers instead.
“If there is such a world, it has not been the reality in the U.S. in a long time,” he said.
What does tend to happen, according to a study last year by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is that raids lead to more job turnover while showing little net change in the employment rate.
“Actions that target employers – audits, investigations, fines, and criminal charges – have larger effects than raids, which target workers,” the study authors wrote.  
The impact to the families can be long-term and devastating. Absences, suspensions, expulsions and rates of substance abuse and self-harm increased among Latino students in a Tennessee town that was raided, even among students whose families were not directly impacted. Property crime dropped but violent crime increased in a small northeast Iowa meatpacking town after a massive 2008 raid. Infants born to Hispanic mothers in that same Iowa town had a 24% risk of low birth weight compared to the same population one year before the raid.

“Our mom is devastated, and she’s scared for herself, too,” Carlos said. “A lot of us are from the same (Zapotec Indigenous) community in Mexico, a lot of people kidnapped in the raid, so it’s like a whole bunch of families had a death.”
In his first term, Trump’s worksite raids focused on the South and the Midwest, when more than 1,800 people were detained, mostly at manufacturing plants and meat and poultry processing facilities. That’s a tiny segment of the estimated 1.5 million people deported under Trump from 2017 to 2021, but it played a significant role in another of the administration’s goals: To create enough fear and mistrust among undocumented immigrants that they self-deport.  
But this time, Trump’s focus is on California. 
‘There’s no money’ after raid
Employees at Ambiance Apparel told each other that immigration enforcement was likely coming to their garment factory. Employees who did not want to be identified told CalMatters that people in Department of Homeland Security jackets were on site at least twice this year, most recently in April. Those workers say they were told by the company not to worry about a raid. 
Ambiance Apparel, through an attorney, denied that the company had any advance warning or involvement with the raid and the company declined to comment further. 
The garment industry is a logical target for immigration enforcement because so much of the workforce is undocumented. The same is true of agriculture. Estimates vary, but anywhere from one third to more than one half of California farmworkers are undocumented immigrants.  
William Lopez, a University of Michigan public health professor who has written a book on the impact of immigration raids on mixed-status families, said he learned in interviews of people present at six immigration raids in the Midwest and South in 2018 that people “haven’t developed the language” to capture the impact of large-scale immigration raids on a community. 
After a raid, “people don’t drive, there’s no money because everyone’s paying bond, no one’s going to school anymore,” Lopez said. 
He continued, “the comparisons were, there was hurricanes, there was tornadoes, there was war, some people compared it to a public execution. Some people described it like the death of a grandchild.”
Congress made it illegal to knowingly hire workers who don’t have authorization in 1986, as part of an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system. The overhaul also legalized about 2.7 million undocumented immigrants.
Still, false Social Security numbers have been fairly easy to obtain, and employers are largely able to duck liability with only a cursory review of the documents workers present when they’re hired.
Employers have had little incentive to get stricter, even after the high-profile raids of meat and food processing plants during the second term of the George W. Bush administration. Demand for labor has remained high, fines for those caught have been lax and the use of contractors and subcontractors has proliferated, spreading out the risks of hiring.. 
“The number of employers who have been fined or imprisoned under the statute is very low compared to the number of employees who have been rounded up as a result of these (workplace) raids,” said Leticia Saucedo, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law. “The idea behind all of these was, yes, to target the employers, but employees were collateral damage.”
Saucedo said workplace raids and the deportation of workers highlight tensions between two wings of the Republican Party. Nativist groups want to curb immigration because they believe it displaces American workers, while business interests want access to a stable, legal pool of immigrant workers.

California farmer ready to demand a warrant
California farmers are especially sensitive to potential immigration raids. The Border Patrol conducted a sweep in Kern County just before Trump took office in January that previewed its approach in the new administration. In June, agents swept through farms in Ventura County, conducting immigration raids. iIndustry groups implored the administration to reconsider such tactics.
“To ensure stability for our farm families and their communities, we must act with both common sense and compassion,” Bryan Little, policy director at the California Farm Bureau, said in a statement. “The focus of immigration enforcement should be on the removal of bad actors or lawbreakers, not our valuable and essential farm employees.”
In an interview, Little said he hasn’t seen evidence of widespread enforcement at farms. But reports of any ICE sightings or arrests in agricultural areas have spread on social media, spreading fear among the workforce. 
“The way this is all being handled, it’s interfering with food production,” he said. 
In Ventura County, federal agents ultimately arrested more than 30 immigrants in June, said Hazel Davalos, director of the local farmworker advocacy group CAUSE. 
Lisa Tate manages three of her family’s eight ranches in the county, where they grow citrus, avocados and coffee. Depending on the day, anywhere from five to 100 directly hired and contracted workers plant, trim or harvest on the land.
They were not among the farms visited by immigration agents, but Tate said she held a meeting with her workers to communicate a longstanding company policy: if agents ever show up, “nobody’s to be on our farm without proper authorization.”
Tate said the raids have put employers like her in a tough position. She said she has never knowingly hired any undocumented workers. She said she reviews the employment documents her workers present, fills out the I-9 form and follows the rules.
Still, she called it a “well-known secret” that many in the industry don’t have valid work permits.
She’s tried to use the guest worker visa program before, but it comes with costly requirements to provide housing and transportation, and to guarantee the guest workers have enough paid hours for the months they’re here. That was hard to budget for on a smaller farm like hers, she said, so she prefers hiring contracted workers locally as needed.

California lawmakers could set new education requirements for police officers, but the bill has critics from all sides — including former Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, who authored the state’s watershed 2021 police reform bill. 


Amid calls for police reform in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, California lawmakers set out to raise education standards for incoming law enforcement officers. Five years later — as California faces a widespread shortage of police officers — those reforms are being debated once again. 
In 2020, former Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer introduced a bill that would have required prospective police officers 18 to 25 years old to earn a bachelor’s degree before entering the police force. A growing body of research shows that college-educated law enforcement officers tend to use less force and exercise better decision making. 
The bill was ultimately revised after it was criticized as too restrictive by law enforcement and labor leaders. In an updated version, which was signed into law the following year, lawmakers agreed to raise the minimum age of a police officer to 21 years old, and they asked local police and school officials to create recommendations for new higher education requirements. 
This year, Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, is proposing a new bill to establish education standards based on those recommendations, but some law enforcement and criminal justice reform advocates are skeptical — albeit for different reasons. 
Starting in 2031, Irwin’s new law would require incoming officers to get a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree, although there are some exceptions within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. It also creates a law enforcement recruitment task force to identify and recruit candidates for law enforcement agencies throughout the state.
In an interview with CalMatters, Jones-Sawyer said the current bill by Irwin undermines the original intent behind his 2021 law by allowing a loophole for incoming officers to satisfy the education requirement through a certificate, prior military experience or out-of-state law enforcement experience. 
Some policing experts, such as former justice department official Arif Alikhan, echoed those concerns and said the exceptions swallow the whole. “It completely obviates the need to have any educational background,” said Alikhan. “Officers who have a college education tend to perform better.”
Representatives from some law enforcement unions, by contrast, think the bill still goes too far. Dustin Smith, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, said the new requirements “would be catastrophic to staffing statewide,” limiting the supply of incoming officers. 
Those concerns haven’t stopped the bill from sailing through the Legislature, where it has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies. It’s supported by all of California’s statewide law enforcement advocacy groups, including the California Police Chiefs Association, the California State Sheriff’s Association, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen and the umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions, the Peace Officers Research Association of California. It has received no formal opposition.
Democratic lawmakers at odds with one another over new standards
In introducing his bill, Jones-Sawyer viewed a college education as paramount to law enforcement training because it would expose incoming officers to new perspectives, healthy debate and critical thinking skills.
“We keep looking at law enforcement as if anybody can do it,” said Jones-Sawyer. “No. You need a certain type of person to have the skills and ability to deal with modern-day policing.” 
Instead of requiring an associate degree in modern policing, as Jones-Sawyer said he intended, the new bill allows incoming police officers to meet the education standards with four years of military or out-of-state law enforcement experience. While Jones-Sawyer intended to carve out certain exceptions for people with prior specialized military or law enforcement experience, they would have only been given some credit – not all. 
New officers also have the option of attaining a “professional policing certificate” from an accredited college or university, although that curriculum has not yet been developed. 
The new bill “does not make policing better, it makes it devolve back into what it used to be,” said Jones-Sawyer. Irwin maintained that the bill advances his efforts and will help police officers improve themselves as they rise through the ranks.
Many police chiefs and sheriffs view the bill as a meaningful way to raise education standards while affording incoming officers the flexibility to meet them. 
In May, Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna wrote a letter to Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat and chair of the Senate’s public safety committee, arguing in favor of Irwin’s bill. The sheriff’s office once required all applicants to have a bachelor’s degree, wrote Luna, but the requirement was “short-lived” because the office saw “an immediate decline in applicants by about 50 percent.”
Luna said Irwin’s bill is a “more workable, more inclusive path forward” because it includes exceptions for those with non-academic experience.  
Although the vast majority of local law enforcement agencies nationwide only require a high school diploma, having a college degree can often create more opportunities for better pay and promotions.
Police officer shortage: truth or myth?
All across the state, law enforcement officials say staffing is an ongoing problem, which more education requirements might exacerbate. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office is short roughly 1,500 officers as of June 1, according to spokesperson Miesha McClendon. The office was able to respond to recent protests through the support of staff from other areas of law enforcement, including its jails and detective division, McClendon said.
In rural areas, such as Plumas County in the northeast corner of the state, Undersheriff Chad Hermann said a single officer is sometimes responsible for covering communities that are as far as 70 miles apart. If that officer needs to make an arrest and drive a suspect to jail, a town could spend hours without any nearby police on duty, he said. 
Sheriffs and police officers say the shortage is due to several factors, including low wages in some communities, an aging workforce and negative perceptions of police following high-profile instances of misconduct. Departments are offering starting bonuses and other incentives, such as better benefits, as a way to recruit new officers. 
Some agencies gave record-breaking raises to officers coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some places, including the California Highway Patrol, entry-level officers can expect six-figure salaries and top notch benefits.
But not all agencies can offer those perks.
“We’re not a rich county — we can’t offer the big hiring stipends,” said Hermann. “By adding a requirement like an associate degree, it’s going to make it harder to get people from our hiring pool.” He said even exceptions for those with military service may not help the recruiting problem since the hiring pool is so small in a county with just under 19,000 residents.
While the new law enforcement recruitment task force in Irwin’s bill is designed to ease some of those staffing challenges, Christy Lopez, a law professor at Georgetown University said it’s troubling to see that it would only comprise people from law enforcement. 
“We need to be moving towards a recruiting approach that seeks to screen in the right people, not just screen out the worst people,” she said. “And to make sure that we develop that sort of approach to recruiting, you need perspectives broader than just law enforcement.”
She said the police recruiting crisis is a myth. “The idea that there’s a crisis in recruiting presupposes that we know what the right number of police officers is and that we’re not there,” she said. “And we don’t know that.” 
What it takes to become a police officer
Devin Nisbet grew up in Calaveras County and as a kid, he had a positive experience with one of the officers when he prank-called 9-1-1. Instead of just disciplining Nisbet, who was around 6 years old, the officer gave him a tour of the police cruiser and handed  him a patch with the sheriff’s office logo. “It made me want to be part of it,” said Nisbet in an interview with CalMatters.
After dropping out of college, Nisbet was working for a grocery store in Calaveras County when that same sheriff’s office held a recruiting event in a nearby parking lot. The agency promises a $10,000 bonus, spread out over three years, for new recruits. At the time, he said he thought to himself, “Why not try to do this?” 
It took Nisbet roughly seven months to pass the county’s background checks and exams, which include a written test, a psychological exam and a medical exam. He then received a tentative job offer from the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office, contingent on completing a police academy. 
In January, he enrolled in the police academy at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton. Police academy training in California typically takes a minimum of six months, but some police departments require far more training. Nisbet is paid by the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office for the entirety of this training, just under $34 an hour.
The college program requires students to learn CPR, first aid, and various laws about use of force, search and seizure and firearms. They’re tested in scenarios that can include chases or combat. In one timed exam, they must pull a 165 lb dummy, cross a 25 yard obstacle course, run 500 yards and scale a 6-foot fence.
Some students fail to pass the academy’s courses. Others never get hired because they fail the police department’s background checks or have low scores.
Nisbet is set to graduate on July 2, at which point he’ll begin working, but his training won’t be over. New officers must complete weeks of field training and a year of probation. 
“I believe that people, if they want to do this job, they need to get evaluated first,” said Nisbet, though he said an associate degree shouldn’t be required. He said many of his classmates don’t have a college degree.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062725-Police-Academy-JC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552
,California,2025-07-08 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why nail salons are still being targeted in fights over California gig worker law,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/workers-nail-salons-labor-bill/,"California’s landmark labor law aims to make nail salon workers, predominantly Vietnamese women, full employees rather than contractors in an industry known for labor violations.","In summary
California’s landmark labor law aims to make nail salon workers, predominantly Vietnamese women, full employees rather than contractors in an industry known for labor violations. 


Like thousands of other Vietnamese-American women in California, Emily Micelli started painting nails to support herself. She turned that weekend job into a two-decade-long career as a manicurist, and now offers her own nail art designs at an upscale Newport Beach salon.
This year, she found her livelihood upended by a few words in the state labor code. 
Like other workers in the beauty industry, state-licensed nail technicians were granted an exemption from Assembly Bill 5, the sweeping 2019 law targeting the gig economy that required many employers to classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors. 
For nail salons, the exemption was temporary. When it ended on Jan. 1 this year, thousands of manicurists across the state found themselves in legal limbo over their employment status. Many, like Micelli, value their working conditions as independent contractors where they can choose their clients and set their own schedules and are unwilling to be reclassified as hourly employees of the salons where they work. 
Lawmakers, backed by unions and workers’ advocates, are now rushing to extend the exemption again — but still only temporarily. 
Labor groups say the law targets an industry with an exploited workforce, and they still want to address that. One estimate by UCLA and the California Healthy Nail Salons Collaborative advocacy group says that more than 80% of nail salon workers are immigrants, the overwhelming majority of whom are Vietnamese women. The report’s authors said those workers are vulnerable to worker misclassification, below minimum wages and other labor violations.
Salon owners and some manicurists say that scrutiny is discriminatory. A group of Vietnamese-owned salons and nail technicians, including the Blu Nail Bar where Micelli works, sued the state this year. They claim it is racial discrimination to exempt every beauty profession from stricter employee classification laws except the one made up largely of Vietnamese licensees.
“I feel like they singled us out,” Micelli said. “For hair, they can choose (to be an independent contractor). For nails, they don’t allow us to.”
The debate has exposed two vastly different sides of a ubiquitous industry. Many of the women filing, shaping and painting Californians’ nails in over 6,000 establishments statewide say they deserve to be viewed as independent, professional artists the same as their peers across the beauty industry — even as they acknowledge grueling work conditions in some salons. 
Micelli said other salons that have employed her in the past imposed assembly line-like conditions and rushed her to perform more services. 
As an independent contractor, she buys her own supplies to stay nimble with trending styles, manages her own appointment hours and sets her own prices. She splits the proceeds 50-50 with the salon, giving the salon a higher cut than normal for its upscale environment. 
She most enjoys having a flexible schedule so she can chat with her clients, one at a time. 
“It was 30 minutes for a manicure and then you have to move on to the next one,” she said of other salons. “I hope the government doesn’t force us to go into something where I have to comply with a salon. I consider myself a nail artist.”
‘More complaints specifically’ in nail salons
Manicures, once a luxury service, have exploded in availability over the past half-century to become synonymous with everyday indulgence.
That’s due in part to new tools and acrylic nails, and to the proliferation of immigrant-owned nail salons. Beginning with a group of refugee women in Sacramento who learned how to do nails from Hollywood actress Tippi Hedren’s personal manicurist in the 1970s, nail tech work became a go-to rung on the economic ladder for Vietnamese American workers and entrepreneurs.
The number of licensed manicurists in California has more than tripled since 1987, to more than 125,000 in 2023. Nearly half of those who take the licensure exam each year do so in Vietnamese, said Jaime Schrabeck, a Carmel manicurist and industry advocate who analyzed data from the state Board of Barbering and Cosmetology. 
In 2015, the New York Times drew national attention to workplace abuses. Its investigation, which focused primarily on Korean-owned nail salons in New York City, found workers were underpaid, trafficked and toiled with dangerous chemicals. 
Lawmakers in California took notice, holding a hearing that year on the industry. 
State labor regulators had also tangled with nail salons. In one 2013 suit, the state accused the Southern California chain Happy Nails & Spa of wrongly classifying their workers as independent contractors instead of employees based on how much control the businesses had over manicurists’ hours and work. The state lost. The chain is now among the businesses suing over AB 5.

Employees are more expensive because they are subject to protections like minimum wage, overtime, meal breaks, workers’ compensation and sick days.
“We found out there were more complaints specifically about misclassification and more findings about misclassification in manicurists than overall cosmetology,” said former Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who convened the 2015 hearing. 
When Gonzalez introduced AB 5 in 2019 to apply even stricter worker classification rules, many beauty professionals who rent booths in salons lobbied to keep working independently. 
They were exempted from the law and could remain independent contractors, provided they could prove that they took their own payments, booked their own customers and maintained their own businesses separately from the salons where they worked. 
The exemption was temporary so lawmakers could evaluate efforts to educate the largely immigrant business owners on how to correctly classify workers.  
In 2021, lawmakers extended the temporary nail salon exemption to 2025. But after Gonzalez left the Legislature to lead the California Labor Federation, the issue fell by the wayside. A subsequent bill to grant the exemption permanently died without a hearing, catching manicurists by surprise.
Nail workers scramble to comply
Janice Luper was renting space in a Tehachapi salon where she had her own key and city business license when she found out the law was about to change. 
Gonzalez said such arrangements are clearly independent, and would not be considered employment under AB 5. But Luper, a self-described rule follower, said the law makes it hard to prove she’s not an employee, requiring that a contractor’s work be “outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.” Because the salon owner also did manicures, Luper worried her own services wouldn’t be considered separate enough. 
So she moved out. By the end of the year, she and a hair stylist opened their own salon — a $30,000 investment Luper is keenly aware many other nail technicians can’t afford. 
Other manicurists and salon owners got the attention of Republican Assemblymember Tri Ta, who is Vietnamese and represents Orange County’s Little Saigon. He introduced a bill this year to permanently exempt nail salons from AB 5. The Assembly Labor Committee never granted it a hearing. 
Instead, the committee, chaired by Hayward Democrat Liz Ortega, in June introduced a different bill to extend the exemption until 2029. The Employment Development Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office would be required to study the rate of labor violations in the nail industry to develop rules that “ensure manicurists enjoy equal rights under California law.”
“​​These are hard-working immigrant women who put in long hours in often toxic environments where their hours and wages are controlled by shop owners, just like any other employees,” Ortega said in a statement.

But the nail salon operators are often immigrants themselves, and in an interview, Ta chafed at the idea that those owners were uniquely violating labor law, saying there are bad actors in any industry. 
“You cannot, because of one bad actor, treat everyone unfairly,” he said.
‘This is how everybody does it’
The UCLA report found a third of nail technicians are independent contractors, three times higher than the rate for all workers. But what some say is a common, legitimate business model, others call widespread misclassification. 
One Southern California manicurist, who spoke to CalMatters on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing her job, said she learned of the practice 10 years ago when she started working at a salon in the Inland Empire. 
The Chinese-American manicurist said she felt the Vietnamese owners passed her over for the more expensive services, limiting her to basic manicures. She was paid a 40% commission on each service and issued a 1099 form for contractors, even though the owner set her hours and handled payments.
When she asked to be classified as a W-2 employee, her boss refused.
“She said, ‘This is how everybody does it,’” she said. “‘We’re just doing what everyone else is doing.’”
She returned to manicuring in December 2023, and bounced around for a year in several salons with similar arrangements. She now works at a salon in Monrovia, finally as a W-2 employee. But she said she’s still paid a 60% commission. 
“It’s not hourly, which I don’t feel is fair because I’m there over 10 hours” per shift, she said. “Sometimes when customers come late, we have to stay late.”
On an average day, she said she makes about $100 before tips — a rate far below California’s $16.50 minimum hourly wage. 
She recently drove down a boulevard in Rowland Heights, stopping in every nail salon she saw to look for a new job. The responses she heard in a half-dozen businesses were the same: No W-2 jobs, no hourly pay. 
She’s never reported it to state labor officials. 
“I need a job, and this is how they’re doing it everywhere,” she said. 
The costs of employment
Six months after opening her own salon, Luper now finds herself on the other side of the business equation. 
The overhead costs have been much higher than renting a space, and as the only manicurist in the building, she’s too busy with her own clients to handle walk-ins. She wants to bring in another nail technician — ideally a booth renter – to take customers off her hands and offset costs. 
But she’s held off with the legal situation up in the air. She never envisioned being an employer, and said she can’t afford to take on payroll taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and paying an hourly wage regardless of whether there are customers. Besides, she said, she doesn’t think she could pay enough to attract an employee.
“No manicurist is going to work for the minimum wage,” she said. “That’s not why we went to school.”
She wishes the state worked harder to investigate bad actors and enforce existing classification laws rather than complicating a business model that worked for her. In the past year, the state Labor Commissioner’s Office has cited one nail salon for misclassifying workers, spokesperson MariCarmen Estudillo said.
The Monrovia manicurist said she’d love to make the hourly minimum wage. But she, too, is wary about AB 5. Business isn’t busy like it was at her first salon, where customers would crowd in and she would work the whole day without a break. If nail salons had to pay all the costs of formal employment, she doesn’t think they’d survive.
“I want to get paid for the time there,” she said. “At the same time, I don’t know how long I can have this job at this place if this continues.”
And without the job, she can’t build up clientele to work independently, as she dreams. She wants to offer her own nail designs, specializing in the builder gel technique that’s become a popular alternative to acrylics. And she’s studying for an esthetician’s license so she can also do facials. 
Then she wants to rent her own studio in a quiet salon, with just one chair and one client at a time.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050118_Nail-Salon_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus on Monday said the Republican caucus will not file a lawsuit challenging the legality of two resolutions passed by Democrats last month during the waning moments of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Titus, a Republican from Wellington, said there is legal standing to challenge one of the resolutions, but that the second resolution, which is the primary source of the party’s ire, would not likely be invalidated because “the judiciary is unlikely to intervene in internal legislative process and procedures.”
“We will prosecute our case in the public opinion,” she added.
The Legislative Commission, which meets during the interim period between Nevada’s biennial legislative sessions to approve regulations and handle other legislative matters, consists of 12 members, six from each chamber. Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 changed the guidelines for determining the partisan split of the commission, resulting in Democrats strengthening their majority on the powerful interim board.
Specifically, Senate representation on the commission moved from an even split (three Democrats, three Republicans) to favoring Democrats 4 to 2. The Assembly side was already divided 4-to-2 in favor of Democrats and remains so under the new formula.
That brings the overall makeup of the Legislative Commission to eight Democrats and four Republicans. It had been expected, based on a resolution passed in the first days of this year’s session and resolutions from prior sessions, to be seven Democrats and five Republicans.
Senate Resolution 9 appointed specific lawmakers to the newly restructured commission.
https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/06/03/nevada-legislature-11th-hour-sprint-on-final-day-not-enough-for-film-studio-two-lombardo-bills/
SCR8 was introduced in the literal final hour of the final day of this year’s legislative session, which the state constitution required to end on June 2. Titus, reading prepared comments Monday at this interim session’s first meeting of the Legislative Commission, noted that the resolution was voted on in the Assembly before the Senate, “a procedural irregularity that denied minority memberships adequate review and deliberation.”
Titus called the actions “unacceptable in a body committed to fairness, that legislates for an even partisan state.”
Once SCR8 was brought up for a vote in the Senate, Democrats used parliamentary rules to cut off debate and force a floor vote, which led to a series of motions and outcry from Republicans. The resolution passed on party lines. Resolutions are not subject to gubernatorial vetoes, leaving no recourse for Republicans.
The flurry of motions and heated comments on SCR8 amounted to a filibuster for SR9, which appointed specific lawmakers to the commission and was up for vote in the Senate after SCR8. SR9 was not voted on until after midnight — 12:18 a.m. on June 3, according to Titus.
The timing of the SR9 vote makes “a strong legal case to invalidate,” read a Senate Republican Caucus press release recapping Titus’s statements, but “judicial intervention is unlikely on SCR8 due to longstanding precedent against courts intervening in internal legislative matters.”
Under SR9, Titus and fellow Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen were appointed to the 2025-27 Legislative Commission. The four Democrats appointed were Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and state Sens. Skip Daly, Rochelle Nguyen, and Melanie Scheible.
Cannizzaro, who was running Monday’s commission meeting when Titus made her comments, did not respond to the broader criticism of the 11th hour passage of SCR8. Instead, she said the meeting was an inappropriate venue for a debate on legislative matters and that the commission has rules of decorum that do not allow the “calling out” of other members.
Cannizzaro refuted only one allegation made by Titus: that Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony was “locked out” of the chamber and not able to fulfill his constitutional duty of presiding over the Senate.
“That is 100% untrue,” she said.
Titus, Anthony and other Republicans have publicly claimed that the lieutenant governor was blocked from entering the chamber. Senate President Pro Tempore Marilyn Dondero Loop, a Democrat, presided over the Senate during the stretch of the 11 p.m. floor session where SCR8 was voted on.
At Monday’s Legislative Commission meeting, Hansen briefly spoke during the public comment period about the incident.
“He may not have been locked out,” said Hansen of the lieutenant governor, “but I stood there and witnessed him trying to get into … the chamber and saw the sergeant-in-arms blocking him from entering the chamber.”
Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who earlier in the meeting was selected chair of the Legislative Commission, cut Hansen off after three minutes. Public comment is typically limited to three minutes per speaker.
Partisan power grab?
In the first few days of the 2025 Legislative Session, state lawmakers passed an Assembly concurrent resolution that, among other things, included rules for establishing the partisan split of the Legislative Commission. That resolution mirrored language used in prior sessions and specified that if the minority party controlled at least one-third of seats in a chamber, the commission would be evenly divided between the parties. If the minority party controlled between one-fifth and one-third of seats, the party would have two of the six seats for their chamber.
SCR8 changed those guidelines. Now, the minority party only gets two of six seats if they control at least a third but not half of their chamber’s seats, and the commission is only evenly divided if the chamber is evenly divided.
The Senate Democratic Caucus has not publicly commented on why they sponsored the 11th hour resolution to change the makeup of the commission. The caucus did not respond to the Nevada Current’s request for comment Monday.
Republicans have characterized it as a partisan power grab.
The Legislative Commission gives final approval to regulations established by state agencies. Those can have major impacts across the state, and they can be controversial. For example, onerous regulations drafted by the Secretary of State’s Office and approved by the Legislative Commission were cited as the reason why at least one rural county opted not to attempt to hand-count ballots in the 2024 elections.
The Legislative Commission’s makeup now more closely resembles the makeup of the state’s other powerful interim body, the Interim Finance Committee, which handles money matters while the full Legislature is not in session. The IFC is composed of the members of the Senate Finance and Assembly Ways and Means committees, whose makeup is determined by the partisan split of each chamber.
IFC has 23 members — 17 Democrats and six Republicans. The Legislative Commission, with 12 members, now has eight Democrats and four Republicans.
For comparison, the Nevada State Assembly’s 43 seats are split 27 Democrats, 15 Republicans. The Nevada State Senate’s 21 seats are split 13 Democrats, eight Republicans.
The Legislative Commission has been the source of partisan-driven drama before. In 2017, Democrats appointed to the commission Patricia Farley, a Republican turned nonpartisan who during that session had mostly voted with Democrats. The move drew sharp criticism from the minority party. That year, Democrats also did not appoint the senate minority leader as a commission member, a break of tradition.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Robin-Titus-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

Jacy Todd of York, 54, who runs a CBD health and wellness retail store in central Nebraska, says he is running to be a “voice of the people.” In part, he said he wants to show it’s not the “richest” people who get into office, that a middle-class family man can as well. 
Todd is the first Republican to challenge incumbent Gov. Jim Pillen ahead of the May 2026 primary. The winner advances to the November 2026 election.

Todd is no stranger around the Nebraska State Capitol or in the public eye. In October, Hall County Attorney Marty Klein, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and their prosecutors charged Todd with 24 counts of improper notarizations, or “official misconduct” — Class II misdemeanors — on the most recent medical cannabis ballot measure. 
Each count refers to a different date that prosecutors allege Todd notarized a specific circulator’s petitions outside of the circulator’s presence. 
Todd has repeatedly denied those allegations and again told the Examiner he is innocent and that his integrity remains “fully intact.”
‘Grassroot this all the way’
Todd said he probably would have been scared if the state had come after him 10 years ago,. But he says people are tired and frustrated and want change. He plans to travel the state and meet Nebraskans to learn what’s bothering them and see how he can help.
Pillen already had about $3.7 million in campaign cash on hand as of January. But Todd said he will “out voice” Pillen and challenge Pillen to debates. During Pillen’s 2022 campaign, he declined debates but did participate in some candidate forums.

Todd said grassroots Nebraskans are charging forward for change.
“I think that Nebraska is a powerful enough state that we could grassroot this all the way to the Capitol and clean house up there,” Todd said.
Part of Todd’s intention to run is also to root out resistance to the people’s will. He started thinking about running for governor as he saw politicians resist the will of more than 71% of Nebraska voters to legalize medical cannabis and 67% of voters to regulate it.
“I didn’t go fight a war and I didn’t go defend the United States for a select few people to turn back the voice of the 70%,” Todd said.
Medical cannabis focus
A combat medic in Operation Desert Storm in his 20s who later joined the Nebraska National Guard, Todd said he began to question the medical expertise of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which suggested he “try” one medication after another to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder, which he said drove him at one point to consider taking his own life.
But when Todd tried cannabis to deal with his pain, he said it led to a “best night’s sleep.” Todd said he continued to research cannabis, which continued to help him.
At one point, Todd said he met cannabis doctors in Colorado and started doing some studies with them. One doctor told Todd that cannabis had saved his life because of interactions with the CB-1 receptors in his brain and endocannabinoid system, so he created his business Herban Pulse to help other Nebraskans find some relief.

As a cannabis user for almost 30 years, Todd said he’s told lawmakers he’s “living proof” of being a functional member of society, going on to run Little League Baseball program and be a scoutmaster. He added he can challenge any lawmaker who argues cannabis hurts intelligence.
“If you guys want to have an IQ test with a pothead, let’s have it. I’ll embarrass you guys to no end,” Todd said with a laugh.
Todd said one of his goals as governor is to advance Nebraska’s cannabis industry to be the best in the nation, including with more research.
He said that while Hilgers and others in the state rule by “visions” of what hemp or cannabis should have been legalized, he sees hypocrisy in trying to outlaw “synthetic” marijuana on one hand while trying to forbid, through regulations, the in-state sale of raw marijuana plant flower on the other.
Notary criminal allegations
Todd said he got a call from the Hall County Sheriff’s Office last August or September and immediately knew it was a coordinated, hyper-focused look into the campaign that he had been a volunteer for the past four years.
He expected the pushback but didn’t expect to be a target. Todd said he told an investigator bluntly that he got his notary license to help with medical cannabis and followed all applicable rules, including witnessing the circulator signature of another campaign volunteer who was criminally targeted last fall.
The investigator asked Todd specifically about that Grand Island man, Michael Egbert, who would go on to plead guilty to illegally adding voters to the medical cannabis petitions, including by using a phone book. None of the Egbert-collected signatures were counted.
Todd said Egbert would come into his store on Mondays, where he would witness Egbert’s signature. That’s the detail Egbert and prosecutors alleged Todd did not do on 24 dates.
Todd said he recalls telling the investigator, “You picked the right guy,” of Egbert. At a separate civil trial against the medical cannabis organizers last fall, Egbert said he has a medical condition that impairs his memory, which some of the products from Todd’s shop sought to help.

The civil trial seeking to disqualify the petitions from reaching the November 2024 ballot ultimately failed, and Todd said he told his attorney as he prepared to be a witness in that case: “I tell the truth. I have nothing to hide. Set us up for a deposition.”
“I’ll do depositions as long as they want to keep on doing depositions. I’ll talk to anybody about it. I didn’t do anything wrong,” Todd said. “If you speak of truth, you don’t have to worry about getting caught up in anything.”
Todd said he didn’t plead his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and answered every question. He was slated to testify at the civil trial, but he was injured just days before after falling through a roof. He has been recovering since.
When investigators reached out to him, Todd said he was angry. But he was also determined to win.
“It brought me probably closer to the situation as far as looking at the corruption in the Capitol, and it’s a select few,” Todd said. “My goal is this: I think if I could cut the puppet strings coming from D.C. into Nebraska, I think that’s a start.”
Headed to trial
The criminal case against Todd was initially dismissed, with his county judge deciding notaries could not be charged in the manner that Todd was. Todd is believed to be the first notary charged with criminal malfeasance for notarial duties in the state, if not the nation, according to Todd’s attorney and multiple court observers.
A Hall County District Court judge reversed that ruling, sending the case back down to trial. The district judge likewise questioned the resources being used to pursue Todd “when looking at the …voice of its residents.”
Todd said he and his attorney plan to “roll the dice” on 12 jurors, instead of one judge, with Todd adding: “I don’t think it’s going to take long at all and that they’re going to find me not guilty.”
Todd’s criminal case heads to trial this September. He retains his notary license.
‘I will fight’
Legal observers see Todd’s charges as a possible test case for criminally scrutinizing notaries involved in petition campaigns or other efforts that government officials might disagree with in Nebraska or other states.
Todd said he plans to win the governor’s race and change the state’s course immediately, including by upholding honesty and transparency.

He said that includes no closed-door meetings and advocating for the elimination of secret ballots for legislative leadership every two years, a long-held goal by many in the GOP.
Todd said he would continue to address property taxes and end a “pyramid scheme” of shifting taxes between property and sales taxes. He wants to pay for tax relief and reduce government spending by implementing an independent audit team, starting at the Capitol, at the “bread and butter of things,” to find millions upon millions of state spending dollars that he says could be saved.
Pillen has sought to reduce the annual $5.3 billion in property taxes, most to local K-12 schools, since taking office in 2023 by broadening the state’s sales tax base. Lawmakers have balked multiple times.
Todd also plans to meet with governors and state leaders of other states to see what solutions might work in the Cornhusker State.
Of Todd’s message to Nebraskans, he said he wants to work for the people and that “four more years of Pillen will be a bitter pill for all of Nebraskans to swallow,” a dig at Pillen’s comments this spring that he would carry out medical cannabis but make sure the medicine would be a “bitter pill to swallow” so it would not trickle over to recreational marijuana.
“I will fight for what is right for all of us, all of Nebraska,” Todd said. “I don’t pick and choose sides.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.












Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University




Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Almost 37,000 students applied for the CHOOSE Act, funded by the state’s Education Trust Fund (ETF), which funds public schools, for the 2025-26 school year. Most of the applicants came from students already enrolled in private schools, according to data released in April. Those intending to use the ESA for public and private school, they received a $7,000 tax credit and those intending to use the funds for home schooling received $2,000.
Of the 37,000 applicants, about 24,000 (64%) were awarded ESAs, according to data from the Alabama Department of Revenue (ALDOR). Nearly 14,000 (60%) of those who received CHOOSE Act money plan to enroll in private school for the 2025-26 school year. Of those 14,000, about 10,000 (71%) were already attending a private school. 
Only 26 of the students in private school intend to use the ESA for public school, according to the ALDOR’s data.

“Our CHOOSE Act education saving accounts are officially ready to support thousands of Alabama families and students with their unique educational needs,” Gov. Kay Ivey wrote in a statement. “In just the first year, our state’s ESA program is incredibly popular, providing opportunity, flexibility and choice when it comes to our children’s education. I am excited to see the program in action this year.”
The Legislature initially appropriated $100 million for the 2025-26 school year, but increased the appropriation to $180 million in the FY26 ETF. The total awarded amount for this school year is nearly $124 million, according to the governor’s office. 
The Council for Leaders in Alabama Schools (CLAS), an organization that provides professional development, networking opportunities, communications, legal support, legislative monitoring and recognition programs for its members, has been opposed to the legislation since its conception. Whitney Miller-Nichols, director of governmental relations for CLAS, said in an interview Thursday that the CHOOSE Act is frustrating because, for the most part, families are making the same school choice, just with a tax credit.

“This is opening up new avenues for families, but the data doesn’t show that. Most kids are going to be educated in the same mode they were before they had the ESA,” Miller-Nichols said. “A different choice hasn’t been made. The choice is just more affordable now.”
This is true for students currently in private school and home school. Nearly 7,000 home-schooled students were awarded funds, and most of them received the $2,000 credit to continue their education at home. About 700 students will get the $7,000 credit and go to private school and about 30 will go to public school with the same credit, according to the data. 
However, about 3,000 (58.6%) public-educated students will switch to private school with the $7,000 credit, according to the data. About 700 (13.6%) will get a $2,000 credit to start a home education program, according to the data.
The ESAs can be used for education-related expenses, including private school tuition and textbooks, according to ALDOR’s parent guide on the ESAs. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,289 per student per year.
The recipients for the next two school years are limited to families whose income is 300% or less of the federal poverty level, about $79,950 a year for a family of three. In 2027, it expands to any family.
“I believe it will be one of the most successful school choice programs in the country. I am proud we established it, and I am proud to continue offering my strong support for it going forward, all while championing our public schools,” Ivey wrote in an op-ed to Alabama Daily News last week.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans from rural areas opposed the law last year, expressing concerns that it could drain the ETF and exacerbate de facto segregation in the state’s public schools.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_5161-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
When Lama Ali Ahmad became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2021, she was eager to become a voter, too.
In Lebanon, where she’s from, elections were often derailed by crises. But here, she had faith in the process. She registered and voted in a municipal election the same day. That night, she gathered her family at her Dearborn home for a special dinner of steak, chicken, and tabbouleh, and told them how good it felt to finally be heard.
“That was the moment where I really felt that I am an American citizen,” she said.
Last year, she celebrated another civic triumph: Voting on a ballot printed in Arabic, her first language.
The experience wasn’t perfect, said Ali Ahmad, who also speaks English and French. The Arabic translation of instructions and ballot questions was more formal than familiar and even awkward in places. But the impact on her was profound.
“I felt like I was at home when I voted in Arabic,” she said.
The translated ballot was available because of a local measure passed in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb with a high concentration of Arabic speakers. Hamtramck, another Detroit-area city with a large Arab-American community, has a similar local law requiring voting materials in Arabic.
But while Arabic is spoken all over Michigan, and is one of the most commonly spoken non-English languages in the U.S., there’s no Michigan or federal law that requires ballot translation into Arabic for people who would benefit from it. Federal voting rights laws do require ballot translations for many other languages, but they emerged at a time when Arabic wasn’t yet widely spoken in the U.S., and they were written restrictively to include only a narrow list of language groups.
That means that in communities across the state and country, Arabic speakers are excluded from the kind of voting access that people of other language groups are entitled to. In Michigan — where Arabic is the third most common language after English and Spanish, spoken by more than 171,000 people (with more than 80,000 of those who report speaking English less than “very well”) — it’s up to individual municipalities to decide whether to require Arabic translations, and then they have to figure out how to arrange them. Translations are costly and difficult to produce, especially in a way that’s familiar enough for everyday speakers to understand.
Dearborn Deputy Clerk Megan Lizbinski said the city has seen voters ask for an Arabic ballot, only to return and request the English version instead because the text in Arabic proves too confusing.
Experts say that if more cities begin doing the translation work together — sharing resources, translators, and templates under state leadership — the process could become cheaper, better, and more accessible for everyone.
 Section 203: Voting rights law leaves Arabic out

The federal laws on ballot translations are contained in Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, a part added in 1975. The section aimed to protect millions of people considered to have been “effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process” because of language, and initially covered a finite set of language groups: Spanish, Asian languages, Native American languages, and Alaskan Native languages.
Section 203 was a breakthrough for a country where many states had long used literacy tests to bar certain groups from voting. But over its 50 years, the law has retained its narrow eligibility criteria, and hasn’t always kept pace with demographic changes.
For a community of non-English language speakers in a particular area to qualify for a translation requirement under Section 203, they must be below certain thresholds for English proficiency and educational attainment, based on U.S. Census data. The list is updated every five years — the next revision comes in 2026 — and most communities don’t make the cut.
In Michigan, just four areas are subject to federally required translations: Clyde Township near Port Huron, and Fennville and Covert Township in the southwest, must translate into Spanish. Hamtramck is required to translate its materials into Bengali.
There’s little political will to broaden the federal criteria, experts say. But state and local governments have more room to act — and more recent success. Experts and advocates hope that will be the path forward for Michigan to adopt a translation policy that better reflects its current voter base.
 Michigan Voting Rights Act called for expanded translations

State lawmakers have tried. Last year, Democratic legislators introduced the Michigan Voting Rights Act, a package of bills aimed at expanding ballot access. Among other things, it would have changed the criteria for a guaranteed translation, requiring many more communities to provide election materials in additional languages.
Coldwater, for instance, a city of around 14,000 in south central Michigan’s Branch County, would have had to offer its election materials in three languages, clerks testified at a House hearing. The city currently provides no non-English materials.
Local election officials didn’t oppose the idea of more translation. But they worried about the potential cost. State officials said the Department of State would pick up most of the tab, but there was no funding guarantee in the bills.
Coldwater budgeted around $33,000 for elections this fiscal year. Printing in two additional languages would have cost thousands more — and that’s before paying translators, running security tests on each version of the ballot, and other related expenses.
But the legislation ultimately died when Democrats failed to pass the package before the session — and their control of both chambers of the legislature — ended. The conversation about expanded language access largely died with it. Rep. Rachelle Smit, the Martin Republican who now chairs the House Election Integrity Committee has made it clear she has no interest in reviving the legislation.
Michigan does provide other language support for voters. The Secretary of State’s website offers information on voting in 19 different languages — the voter registration form alone is available in Spanish, French, Somali, Vietnamese, Russian, Dari, Arabic, Pashto, Bengali, Amharic, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean. Voters are allowed to bring support (including translators) into the voting booth with them, and some communities use phone hotlines for live language help. Others rely on bilingual poll workers, often hired with state assistance.
But other states go further. California, for instance, requires translated ballots for any precinct where more than 3% of voting-age residents are of the same non-English language, compared with the federal standard of 5%.
In Los Angeles County, the largest voting jurisdiction in the country, that includes the languages covered by the federal requirement — Cambodian, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese — as well as Armenian, Bengali, Burmese, Farsi, Gujarati, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Mongolian, Persian, Russian, Telugu, and Thai for certain precincts under state requirements. Other communities across the state are translating election materials into Urdu, Syriac, and Arabic.
A new poll finds that most Californians want the state to go even further, with 87% of respondents who spoke limited English saying they would be more likely to vote if they had a ballot available in their preferred language.
In Hawaii, where all elections are conducted by mail, mail ballots must include instructions on how to access translation services in Hawaiian and at least five other non-English languages.
Minnesota state law requires voting instructions at all polling places to be translated into the three most commonly spoken non-English languages: Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. The state also requires translators at precincts with significant language minorities, meaning voters can get assistance in German, Russian, and other languages.
“As I see it, it’s not about English proficiency really,” Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told Votebeat, explaining that his mother, who was from Austria, spoke English fluently but still preferred to read complicated material in her native language.
“I think most humans are that way. It’s not that she lacked English knowledge, and it’s not as if Hmong speakers or Spanish speakers or Somali speakers or Russian speakers can’t read English. The opposite is often true,” he said. “But when it comes to technical instructions, you want to convey information in a language that best connects with a person.”
People don’t always immediately know that information is available in another language or even think to ask. But when those materials are consistently offered, they help drive civic participation. The translations bring voters closer to truly understanding what they’re weighing in on.
It’s why Lizbinski, the deputy clerk in Dearborn, believes the benefits of offering translation into Arabic “far outweighs the costs.” Those costs are significant: typically around $32,000 for a general election, and closer to $87,000 for a presidential primary, where there are three distinct ballot types. (Those costs, officials say, are likely to rise in future elections.)
 How a statewide model could help in Michigan

Between 1980 and 2021, the number of people in the U.S. who speak Arabic at home grew nearly sevenfold — outpacing most other language groups — according to Pew Research Center, and the community continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, beyond the major hubs like Dearborn, said demographer Kurt Metzger.
As long as that pace continues, local election officials will have a tough time meeting the language needs of Arabic-speaking voters. Shams Al-Badry, civic engagement manager at the Dearborn-based Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, said that history shows that clerks are willing to make the changes but hesitant to shoulder the cost alone.
But experts agree that if the state served as a kind of linguistic clearinghouse, offering ballot translation through a statewide system, rather than relying on individual communities, that problem could be eased.
And if the state covered the expense, Al-Badry said, local officials could focus on delivery: getting translated ballots into the hands of the voters who would benefit the most.
Even native English speakers may have a hard time understanding complex ballot measures. “Now bring in someone who doesn’t fully understand the language … and expect them to vote their conscience,” she said. “That’s really difficult.”
That’s what motivates Ali Ahmad, the Dearborn resident, who is still navigating what it means to be an American citizen. She jokes that she’s not 100% sure what a county treasurer does all day, or why she has to vote on one.
But she’s helping others navigate the system as lead community organizer for the National Network for Arab American Communities. She translates voter guides, educates new citizens, and urges her eligible family members to vote as well.
She appreciates the state’s recent changes to expand voting rights, such as early voting and less restrictive absentee voting.
And “this seems like the next good step in making voting accessible,” she said, “making sure everyone can vote in their language.”

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Concerns raised over unintentional coverage losses at final Medicaid work requirements hearing

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

The Hamburg Massacre took place in South Carolina after Black members of a militia marched on the Fourth of July. 
Two white farmers, temporarily obstructed from traveling through town, brought a formal complaint, demanding the disbandment of the militia. When the trial began, hundreds of armed white men known as “Red Shirts” descended on the small Black community, and militia members retreated to a warehouse they used as their armory. The attackers fired a cannon at the armory, eventually killing seven Black men: Allen Attaway, Jim Cook, Albert Nyniart, Nelder Parker, Moses Parks, Da­vid Phillips and Hampton Stephens. Also killed was Thomas McKie Meriwether, the white victim. 
The Charleston News and Courier denounced the white participants as “cowardly, cruel and murderous.” The newspaper was flooded with canceled subscriptions. 
Eventually, 94 white men were indicted for murder, only to be cheered by throngs of white citizens along the way, who promised, “What we did in 1776 we will do in 1876.” 
It was the beginning of the “Redemption,” reinstituting white supremacist rule, just as Mississippi had done a year earlier.

,California,2025-07-08 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Valadao and other California GOP members of Congress might regret backing Trump’s megabill,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/valadao-congress-republican-regret-bill/,"Congressional Republicans in California are facing attacks over their support for Trump's controversial megabill. What happens in three targeted districts next year could easily determine which party controls the House, with potentially major consequences for the remainder of Trump’s presidency.","Last Thursday, just minutes after the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” to overhaul federal taxes and health care spending, the National Republican Campaign Committee issued a statement touting Rep. David Valadao’s vote for the controversial measure.
“In a major win for Californians, David Valadao just voted to pass landmark legislation that lowers taxes, boosts economic growth, strengthens essential benefits, and restores law and order in California,” the NRCC declared.
“Congressman David Valadao is doing exactly what he promised: delivering real results, restoring fiscal sanity, and fighting for California families,” NRCC spokesman Christian Martinez said. “His vote is proof that strong leadership and commonsense still matter in Washington.”
A couple of hours later, Protect Our Care California, a health care advocacy organization with close ties to Democratic Party leaders, announced that it will air video ads criticizing Valadao and nine other Republican congressional members for their votes.
“Representative David Valadao just voted for the largest health care cuts in history in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations, and we’re going to make sure that every single one of their constituents knows it,” said Matthew Herdman, director of Protect Our Care California.
The ads are aimed at Valadao and other members of California’s Republican congressional delegation, including Young Kim and Ken Calvert, because they are considered to be the most vulnerable incumbents as the two major parties battle over control over the House in next year’s elections.
Republicans have a paper-thin House majority — as demonstrated by the 218-214 final vote on Trump’s high priority bill — and Valadao, Kim and Calvert barely survived past challenges. Valadao first won a congressional seat in 2012, lost it in 2018 and regained it in 2020. He successfully fended off Democrat Rudy Salas in 2022 and 2024.
What happens in the three targeted districts next year could easily determine which party will prevail, with potentially major consequences for the final two years of Trump’s presidency.
Valadao’s vote for the bill is especially noteworthy because Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by 12 percentage points in the San Joaquin Valley’s 22nd Congressional District, two-thirds of his constituents rely on Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid) for their health care, and he had repeatedly promised not to vote for any reductions in the program.
The Fresno Bee’s editorial page quickly excoriated him for seemingly abandoning that pledge under pressure from Trump.
“At a height of 6-feet-4, Rep. David Valadao can cast a giant presence in Washington, D.C.,” The Bee’s editorial board wrote. “Unfortunately, he doesn’t measure up when it comes to looking out for the best interests of his community.”
The editorial continued, “The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, estimated that the Senate version of the bill, which was eventually passed, reduces federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and increases the number of uninsured people by 11.8 million. 
“What happened to Valadao in five days to change his mind? For one thing, he visited the White House on Wednesday. His office didn’t provide details of that reunion, but Trump has used such meetings to pressure reluctant lawmakers to do his bidding over that of the people.”
Valadao insists that he received assurances from the White House that the Medicaid cuts will “be structured in a way that benefits our providers and keeps our hospitals and communities running.”
Aware of his precarious hold on the seat, Valadao has continuously stressed his independence, even being one of only 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump during his first presidential reign.
However, Valadao’s vote for Trump’s bill undermines that independent image and will almost certainly be weaponized as Democrats try again to capture his seat next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-DAVID-VALADAO-REUTERS-GS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 08:02:15.502194

Debbie Wood, R-Valley, will resign from the Alabama House of Representatives at the end of July.
Wood, serving her second term in the chamber, is moving from her east Alabama district, which includes Chambers and Lee counties, near the Florida panhandle due to her husband’s new job in Pensacola. Alabama law requires lawmakers to live in the district they represent. 
“I own property in Chambers County, so I could have completed my term, but my heart and body would have been somewhere else,” Wood said in an interview on Monday. “I could have done it, but it just wasn’t right. The people deserve a full-time representative.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainesville, wished Wood the best in a statement Monday.
“Rep. Wood has been a great member during her time in the House, and we will certainly miss her leadership,” Ledbetter said. 
Wood was first elected to the House from her east Alabama district in 2018 when she won 70% of the vote, according to election results. She got 88% of votes in 2022 against Charles Temm, a Libertarian, according to election results.  
The representative served on the House Education Policy Committee, working on paid parental leave for teachers and the RAISE Act, which allocates additional money to schools based on the presence of certain groups of students, like children in poverty and English Language Learners.
“We don’t always get our name on it, we had to work together,” she said of the paid parental leave law. “The new way that we fund education is a game changer.”
Wood said that she is most proud of legislation she worked on in 2023 with Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, that allows patients access to loved ones during a pandemic.
“I think that’s one of the things I will look back on, and I will be proud that I had a part in patients seeing their loved ones,” she said.
The Legislature passed a law in 2018 that requires a special election in the third year of a four year term if the seat is left vacant by Oct. 1. Gov. Kay Ivey has yet to call a special election for seat Wood is vacating. A message seeking comment from Ivey was left Monday morning.
Micah Messer and Kristin Nelson, both Republicans, have already filed campaign finance reports for the 2026 midterms for House District 38.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program.
For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible.
In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
The program’s participants include more than 500 older South Carolinians, according to the state Department on Aging.
In 16 counties, the state agency partners with Goodwill Industries of the Upstate/Midlands to enroll 112 people annually. Statewide, Goodwill Industries International has a federal contract to oversee the program for an additional 436 people, said Department on Aging spokesman Michael Christopher.
Participants work an average of 20 hours a week. In South Carolina, they’re paid the federal minimum wage for the duration of the program’s on-the-job training: $7.25 an hour.

 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities.
As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Last month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million, and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” said Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years.
While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans add work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
The mega-bill signed by Trump on July Fourth requires nondisabled adults who don’t meet an exception, such as caring for young children, to show they’re working, volunteering or going to school at least 80 hours a month to continue their Medicaid coverage. Those new requirements apply to the 40 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which don’t include South Carolina.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program.
In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress couldn’t cut or eliminate them in the mega-bill signed into law last week.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program — as he did unsuccessfully during his first term — but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20.
The Senate’s plans are less certain. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

The annual NRA meeting and exhibit runs through Sunday.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.












Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University




Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

On Aug. 21, Vermont’s agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement comes to an end. This is a perfect opportunity for us to stop participating in the illegal rounding up of immigrants and the use of our prisons to warehouse detained people.
Not only would it end our complicity in ICE abductions, but it would also unburden our Department of Corrections staff and facilities.

According to the VTDigger story of June 28, prison staff are called on to provide medical information, clothing and prepared meals for detainees being transferred at all hours of the day and night, which is difficult and disruptive for both staff and the regular prison population as well. (For this burden, Vermont receives $180 a day per detainee.)

Socially responsible, employee-owned, B-certified companies are not immune from competition and market changes.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Patten: RIP Gardener’s Supply.","This commentary is by Will Patten of Hinesburg. He is a retired business executive and author of the book, “Saving Capitalism, Vermont Shows a Way.”


Gardener’s Supply is bankrupt and a star has fallen from Vermont’s universe of socially responsible, employee-owned, B-certified companies. These businesses invest in the health of their people, communities and environment with as much fervor as they invest in their financial welfare. Vermont has more of these businesses than any other state on a per capita basis.
Gardener’s Supply was born of Will Raap’s Intervale miracle that transformed a dump into acres of lush vegetable gardens and helped scores of “agripreneurs” start their own businesses. Will taught us the joy of working in the warm spring soils and eating our own fresh produce.
But businesses and corporations are just assemblages of people with a single focus and they are as organic as the people comprising them. They take seed, struggle, blossom and eventually die. Their life span is determined by how well they adapt to an ever-changing world.

Socially responsible, employee-owned, B-certified companies are not immune from competition and market changes. As a retailer, Gardener’s Supply had to compete with behemoths like Amazon, eBay and Walmart. As a values-led company, it had strengths and weaknesses. 
Socially responsible companies enjoy stronger customer loyalty. We like and support companies that care about more than profits. And that loyalty usually guarantees longevity, if not profits, to those companies. But Gardener’s sold high-end products to a niche consumer that could afford them. That’s what we call skinny economics.
Employee ownership has proven to increase the financial health of employees but not necessarily the company. Some companies that are owned through employee stock option plans engage the employees in strategic decisions.
A well-known local brewery decided against growth into regional markets with the counsel of employee-owners. Gardener’s Supply chose aggressive growth.
B certification is a rigorous audit of a company’s investment in financial, human and natural assets. It is designed to inform management of weakness in any of the three areas. It enforces what we used to say at Ben & Jerry’s about our economic and social missions: “No Margin; No Mission.” You can’t save the people and planet without profits.
There is a sign that hangs on our garden shed at home with a quote from Audrey Hepburn: “To garden is to believe in tomorrow.” We prepare the soil, plant the seeds, and hope they can survive the weather, weeds and predators.
That sentiment just as easily describes capitalist enterprises large and small that invest today in hopes they can survive the competition, turbulence, and uncertainty to provide a return tomorrow. 
Gardener’s Supply made decisions that involved risks and failed to provide a return. It happens to businesses every day. I will miss them.

(Getty Images)Gross assessed values for commercial, industrial and residential properties throughout Indiana collectively rose 12% from 2024 to 2025, according to a statewide comparison chart assembled by the Department of Local Government Finance for property taxes due and payable in 2026.
The data is sourced from ratio studies performed annually by the state’s 92 county assessors.
“It is essentially a test of each assessor: how well are you doing? Are you doing this right?” said Larry DeBoer, a retired Purdue University agricultural economics professor and tax expert.
“Not very many … elected officials actually face a test like that. They’re being held accountable.”
Agricultural land, meanwhile, will be assessed at a lower base rate than the previous year, thanks to a provision in the behemoth tax plan Indiana lawmakers approved in April.
That’ll likely shift property tax burden toward other property types, DeBoer noted. That’s not the only shift, however.
The legislation also saves homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years, from 2026 through 2028, according to a fiscal analysis. It does so largely by creating a credit for 10% off every homestead’s bill, up to $300 each.
Local residential trends reemerge

Commercial assessed value grew 16.07% in total, according to the study, ahead of industrial assessed value, which increased 15.59%.
Values for Hoosier houses collectively rose by less: 10.42%.
Lawmakers have, for years, promised cash-strapped homeowners that high assessed values and resulting skyrocketing property tax bills would naturally come down.
“I think we’re seeing some evidence” that values are growing more slowly, DeBoer said.
Relief could be on the horizon at last.
Gross assessed values don’t translate perfectly to property tax bills, however. County auditors will apply all deductions and credits to certify net assessed values, according to DLGF spokeswoman Jenny Banks.
DeBoer also observed a bigger variety in residential value growth than in recent years.
“Covid was a nationwide trend that affected every place — so maybe we’re not seeing a big nationwide or even statewide trend affecting home values now,” he posited.
“We’re back to: assessed value is a local issue,” DeBoer added. “And a local economy, and the local assessing practice, is what seems to be influencing the changes.”
Tax bill eases pressure on farmland
Indiana’s farmland is assessed differently.
DLGF calculates a rolling average using six years of capitalized net operating income and net cash rent. The highest value of the six is dropped from the formula, and the remaining five years are averaged to determine a base rate.
Another increase was in the cards for the base rate, to $2,390 per acre.
That would’ve come after several straight years of big jumps: from $1,500 in assessment year 2022 to $1,900 in 2023 and $2,280 in 2024.
Lawmakers intervened via Senate Enrolled Act 1, increasing the capitalization rate in the formula’s denominator to lower the base rate. Now, it’ll be $2,120 per acre, according to a DLGF memo.
“Yep, that was a victory for the (Indiana) Farm Bureau,” DeBoer quipped.
The formula averages six years to “iron out the blips,” he said, but it also can create a delay where assessed values may keep rising even as farm incomes and commodity prices are falling. The last high pandemic-era value, for example, won’t drop out of the formula until the end of the decade.
The average price of top-quality farmland was $14,392 per acre in 2024, according to a Purdue University Farmland Values survey. Average- and poor-quality farmland prices averaged $11,630 and $9,071, respectively.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman was taken from us by the kind of political violence that is becoming all too common — violence that doesn’t just hurt families, but threatens the integrity of our institutions and the safety of public leadership. Her loss is profound. But her impact didn’t end with her passing. It continues in the work she led, the people she stood with, and the values she fought for.
Melissa was not just a legislator. She was a builder of futures. She built bridges across ideologies, across communities, and through difficult moments. She believed in progress not as rhetoric, but as responsibility; as a promise we make to one another, especially when it’s hard. And, she made that promise real through consequential work for working families — expanding access to paid leave, improving education, and fighting for economic dignity across the state.
At Unidos MN, we know that promise because we’ve lived inside it.
Our leaders — everyday community members who chose to take responsibility for our conditions — stood beside her as she treated undocumented Minnesotans not as outsiders to power but as partners in shaping it. The meatpacking workers, the agricultural workers, the nannies and service workers, the undocumented leaders all walked with her through policy fights, through backlash, and through the fragile yet sacred work of creating space for immigrant families at the heart of Minnesota’s future.
The work and vision we accomplished together in 2024 through our coordinated Future Fund PAC was not just strategy. It was the kind of faith you place in people when the stakes are everything. It was a vision of a Minnesota where no one’s humanity is up for debate. Not the immigrant mother. Not the queer student. Not the undocumented essential worker who held up this state through a pandemic but still lives without health care.
Relationships forged through the struggle of confronting hard issues are profoundly unique. They are built not on convenience or comfort, but on shared purpose, sacrifice and survival. In those moments, trust is not theoretical; it is tested. People see each other in raw, unfiltered ways: in fear, in courage, in failure and in grit. These bonds go deeper than casual friendships because they are rooted in mutual reliance and the knowledge that the other person chose to show up when it mattered most. Melissa showed up when it mattered most, without pretense, unafraid to ask the hard questions, and never dodging the truth. She gave us real answers and met us with respect, treating us not as outsiders, but as full stakeholders, worthy of dignity, voice and power. 
And that’s why I want to speak clearly to one thing today:
One of her final votes — to strip health insurance from undocumented adults — was not a vote against immigrants.
It was a wrenching, complicated compromise. One she took not with pride, but with deep reflection, because she believed it was the only way, in that moment, to protect Minnesota from further harm. She believed it would preserve the fragile groundwork we had built together for future protections, future wins and future hope. And we are a testament to that hope.
Because Melissa Hortman never treated politics as a purity test — she treated it as an act of care. A practice of courage. A long, unglamorous labor toward justice. Even when the cameras were off, even when the hashtags faded, she was still there pushing for the undocumented worker, the student in crisis, the single mom who needed one more reason not to give up. She didn’t show up for the headlines, she showed up for the people. And she was determined to be an instrument to reinstate health care for undocumented adults in the future.
Melissa was taken from us, but her legacy lives on in the generations of Minnesotans impacted by her policies. Let us honor her by continuing the work to improve the lives of all working families, to advance climate justice, protect reproductive rights, strengthen public education, and build a health care system that upholds human dignity. Let us continue the work for a Minnesota that embodies the inclusive and just democracy our nation so urgently needs.
So let us mourn with full hearts, without apology. But let it be a courageous mourning. The kind that refuses to turn away. The kind that holds sorrow in one hand and determination in the other. Because Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman did not live a small life, and we will not offer her a small grief. 
We will grieve by building. We will cry, and still organize. We will honor her not only in silence, but in the noise of collective demand. The chants at the Capitol. The organizing in church basements. The policies reshaped by those she believed in most — the workers, the immigrants, the people too often told to wait their turn. That is the Minnesota she saw. That is the future she helped make possible.
Let us not return to business as usual. Let us rise with the courage she carried, with the clarity she led with, and with the compassion she never abandoned. Let us finish what she started — and begin what she dreamed.
Rest in power, Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman.
Rest in love, Mark Hortman and sweet Gilbert. 
Your legacy is not behind us. It is with us — and ahead of us.
Let us be brave enough to carry it all the way home.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_9225-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550

Glacier Park, like many national parks, charges $35 per car for a week’s entry. (Photo by Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30. 
Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries. 
The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position. 
“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The number of students paddled in Florida schools may decrease now that parents are included in a new state law.
Starting this school year, the state requires parents to approve use of corporal punishment before school districts may administer it.
According to Florida Department of Education data, schools inflicted corporal punishment in 516 instances during the 2023-24 school year. 
“It’s quite honestly amazing that this hasn’t previously been in place in Florida, in a state that really prides itself for its work protecting parental rights,” Jacob Kaplan,  president of the Florida Student Policy Forum, based at the University of Florida, which lobbied for the new law, told the Phoenix. 
Nineteen public school districts in Florida allow corporal punishment, defined as “the moderate use of physical force or physical contact by a teacher or principal as may be necessary to maintain discipline or to enforce school rule.”
Some counties that administer corporal punishment request parental consent, while others just require notification that the punishment could be administered. 
According to the National Education Association, 17 states allow corporal punishment. 
Kaplan, a sophomore, was part of the group that, with the help of Moms for Liberty, navigated the legislative process to get lawmakers on board with the idea.
The process started before Kaplan entered UF. Four years in the making, the proposal started as an outright ban of corporal punishment but switched to requiring parental consent after running into roadblocks inside the Capitol.
Graham Bernstein, former director for political affairs for the Policy Forum and a May University of Florida graduate, said the idea really came to his attention after he read a 2021 article about a six-year-old in Hendry County who was paddled after scratching a computer screen.
According to news reports, the girl’s mother asked administrators to help her discipline the child, and watched and recorded the paddling. Prosecutors did not press criminal charges against the principal.
“Sunlight is the best disinfectant. There is now going to be, whether it’s a paper trail of evidence, or an electronic trail of evidence, guaranteed by state law so that parents can make it clear what they want and what they don’t want, and so that quite frankly teachers and principals are more protected, as well,” Bernstein said.
Discrimination
HB 1255, passed this spring, requires parents to consent to corporal punishment either for the school year or before each instance the punishment is used in traditional public and charter schools.
Many of the districts that permit corporal punishment are northern, rural counties, like Suwannee, Holmes, Columbia, Jackson, Dixie, Hardee, Levy, Franklin, and Liberty.
Kim Winker, the Moms for Liberty Florida legislative chair for the 2025 session, told the Phoenix the law is “the right way to go” and benefits schools, teachers, administrators, parents, and students — and that she, too, was surprised to learn that corporal punishment was still occurring in Florida.
“We were concerned that parents were not given the right to opt in to student corporal punishment, and the fact that it was being disproportionately used on disabled students was concerning to us, as well. We wanted to advocate for allowing parents to decide the discipline decisions being made on their children at school,” Winker said — adding that she is “definitely for” an outright ban on corporal punishment.
According to data compiled by the Policy Forum, while students with disabilities comprise around 20% of school enrollment, in 2023-2024 they accounted for around 40% of corporal punishment inflictions. In Gilchrist County, that number was 59%.
The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights wrote in 2022 that students with disabilities may face heightened discipline “because they are not receiving the support, services, interventions, strategies, and modifications to school or district policies that they need to manage their disability-based behavior.”
The department found students with disabilities may be “subjected to discrimination based on their disability when being disciplined, such as when students with disabilities are unnecessarily disciplined more severely than students without disabilities for the same or similar behavior.”
“The parents need to have the guardrails in place so they can choose what is right for their student, and the schools need to follow the parents’ wishes and have the parents more involved with that,” Winker said. 
Other instances of corporal punishment in Florida schools have drawn media attention, such as in Lake County, which prohibits corporal punishment, when a bus monitor was accused of abusing a student with special needs in 2018; in 2019 in Broward County, which also prohibits corporal punishment, the Miami Herald wrote about a group of parents alleging students with autism bore bruises from a teacher; and an 18-year-old who told The74 that she felt like her teacher in Liberty County “got off by” paddling her.

The process
In addition to Kaplan and Graham Bernstein, Policy Forum members Adam Bernstein (no relation), and Konstantin contributed to the campaign. The organization works toward nonpartisan public policy, such as the initiative to give prisoners free phone calls if they demonstrate good behavior. That $1 million initiative was part of the final legislative budget, but Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed the line item.
“You kind of come to understand that the people making our laws are people just like you and me, with imperfect information access, and that kind of bridging that gap more than anything can really be impactful in changing the lives of people across the state,” Adam Bernstein, a recent UF graduate, said. 
A limit on the number of bills representatives may introduce and opposition from some lawmakers and legislative staff stood in the way of passing corporal punishment legislation in previous years, they said. 
“I don’t know that I’ve ever encountered a more meaningful way of spending my time in terms of learning about public policy issues,” Graham Bernstein said.

Medicaid was their salvation. (Photo courtesy Keith Runyon)The front-page headlines in the last few days have been jarring: “Medicaid Cuts May Force Retirees out of Nursing Homes.”
While much of the battle over Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill for billionaires is theoretical to many of us who’ve always had health insurance and coverage for things like rehab and even nursing homes, this information hit home for me.
In 1999, over Labor Day weekend, my mother had a paralytic stroke that left her entire right side lifeless. Although her mind was unimpaired, most of what she cared about in life was deeply affected. Since early childhood she had been a pianist, eventually a very fine one trained at the University of Louisville. Her days at the keyboard were ended. So was her ability to walk, to take care of basic chores, even to bathe. So was her ability to spend time with her grandchildren, and to entertain the family for holidays.
Yet her heart, at age 75, was still strong and her will to live was, at least for a time, unflinching. But within six months or so, after long treatment in a rehab center, Medicare required that she go home or go on full pay.
My parents lived the American dream in the postwar era. They were comfortably off, owned their own home, and educated their two sons — with no student loans. But even in 1999, they couldn’t afford, for very long, the steep prices that nursing homes charged. So Mother came home in a wheelchair, where she remained under my aged father’s care until he could bear it no longer. The family housekeeper, who had cared for my grandmother until she died, was as old as Mother, so she wasn’t up to the task either.
One night in April 2000 the call came from my brother that my father was so ill that he was unable to rise from the living room sofa. Within an hour, he was in an emergency room, dying of congestive heart failure.
He was brought back to life by one of Louisville’s great cardiac surgeons, Morris Weiss, but for the rest of his life he was frail and dependent on medicine, walked with a cane, and was unable to take my mother back home. Alas, nursing home care was the only option for her,
My father was always very private about his finances, so I never quite knew when, but his savings (and Mother’s) dried up and she was transferred to Medicaid. He was even reluctant to speak of it. We all thought Medicaid was for indigents, or the terribly disabled.
Turns out, Medicaid was for us. I learned that a lot of nursing homes welcomed Medicaid residents. An attorney who specialized in issues involving the aged advised our family. Then an elderly aunt died and left Mother some money. Immediately she went back onto private pay until those dollars were gobbled up. So back on Medicaid she went.
Meanwhile Daddy sold our family home, which gave him some money for emergencies but very few pleasures. He moved into a nice senior citizens’ complex, designed for independent living, with group meals and activities. He made friends and played cards and was close enough to Mother’s nursing home to pay daily visits. Then, his health began to fail.
For a time there was a very real prospect that both of them would be in nursing homes at the same time. Then, in the spring of 2008, each began a further decline. Mother decided that enough was enough. She told me and my Aunt Rose, “I want to die.” And so she did, by declining food and medication. She ended her days in a palliative care unit in St. Matthews, only a few blocks from where she had lived the happiest days of her life. In retrospect, I think she died of a broken heart.
A month later, her older sister Lucille died at the ripe old age of 91, in her own home surrounded by loved ones. And then, just after July 4, my father joined them, passing from life in the very same corridor as my mother, attended by the same nurses. It was a blessing.
It is too painful for me to imagine what would have happened if Mother had been thrown out of the nursing home for inability to pay. “Tax reform” – Donald Trump-style – might well make that happen. It is despicable legislation, the product of a time when lowering taxes for the rich “trumps” caring for the people who made this country great through hard work and patriotism. I don’t think my father went to fight in World War II to save a nation where the super-rich call the shots.
If this is a “big, beautiful bill” in the eyes of some, to me, it is a cancer in the American soul.

One million employees have no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)One year after the launch of a state-run retirement savings program aimed at private sector workers, more than 18,000 New Jerseyans have signed up and the program has surpassed more than $8.1 million in assets, state officials announced this week.
RetireReady NJ, established by a law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in March 2019, is intended to provice workers at small businesses with an easy way to save for retirement. Todd Hassler, executive director of the program, formally known as the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program, said in a statement that it provides a model for other states looking to give workers accessible ways to save.
“These accomplishments demonstrate New Jersey’s commitment to improving the retirement outcomes of our citizens. The RetireReady NJ team is very proud of the difference we are making in the financial security of the citizens here in New Jersey,” Hassler said.
RetireReady NJ is targeted at closing the retirement savings gap. One million full-time workers statewide are working without access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the American Retirement Association says.
At least 20 states have implemented their own retirement savings programs, according to Georgetown University.
Under RetireReady, New Jersey businesses that have been operating for at least two years and have at least 25 employees are required to register if they do not offer qualified retirement plans. The program is free for all employers to implement. So far, more than 1,200 employers have joined the program.
Workers who don’t opt out can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA through payroll deductions.
The program was set to be implemented in 2021, but was repeatedly delayed due to the pandemic.
“The staff deserves credit for positioning New Jersey as a model for how states can offer accessible retirement savings programs,” State Treasurer Liz Muoio said in a statement.

Country’s second-largest crypto exchange names Cheyenne its home base. Wyoming leaders believe their pursuit of digital assets is paying off.
The post Wyoming landed one of crypto’s biggest names. Here’s what that means for the state. appeared first on WyoFile .","After years wooing the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry, Wyoming’s efforts were rewarded last month by one of the biggest players in the space.
Kraken — a multi-billion-dollar crypto company with over 2,200 employees and 15 million customers around the globe — announced it had officially moved its headquarters to Cheyenne.
“Wyoming may feel like one small town with really long streets,” Trevor Rutar, the Cheyenne-based head of Kraken’s banking venture, wrote on LinkedIn, “but it continues to punch above its weight in the future of finance.”
In a lengthy post on X, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi praised the state for building the “most comprehensive and technically coherent legal framework for digital assets” in the country.
“This decision wasn’t about headlines or optics,” Sethi said. “It was about alignment.”
The company, which allows customers to securely trade cryptocurrencies and more traditional assets, opened a Cheyenne office over four years ago and has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the University of Wyoming’s blockchain program. But the formal establishment of a Wyoming headquarters makes the company’s ties to the state “permanent,” Sethi said.

For the lawmakers and others who’ve led Wyoming’s yearslong effort to become a crypto hub, Kraken’s announcement is a big deal — particularly at a time when other states are beginning to vie for the industry’s business.
“For them [Kraken] to make this step now and kind of recognize and come to Wyoming, I just think it’s a really cool sort of validation of all the work that Wyoming has done,” said Matt Kaufman, a Cheyenne attorney and longtime member of the state’s blockchain committee.
Long-running pursuit
The digital asset space is best known for its volatile cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, and the massive gains and losses that can result from buying and selling them. But advocates, including those in Wyoming, see much broader potential in the underlying blockchain technology.
Blockchains are shared ledgers that allow transactions to be readily verified by all participants and, in theory, make it nearly impossible for the data to be tampered with or altered. Beyond tracking the transfers of digital tokens, supporters see a variety of potential uses ranging from supply chains, to electronic voting to making secure payments at a fraction of the cost of credit cards.
Believing that the technology would bring new jobs and other economic development, Wyoming lawmakers set out to become the home base for the digital asset industry in the same way that South Dakota became the hub for credit card companies. Over the past eight years, state lawmakers dove into the topic and passed over 30 laws related to blockchain technology and digital assets — from setting up a framework for crypto-banks to making clear what happens to customers’ digital assets if a crypto custodian goes bankrupt. 
“When we started, the large financial institutions were shunning digital assets with every fiber of their being. They loathed them,” recalled Wyoming Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, who co-chairs the Legislature’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation.

But traditional players have since come around: juggernauts like Fidelity and Blackrock now hold billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of their clients; Amazon and Walmart are reportedly mulling the possibility of launching dollar-like cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins in an attempt to save “billions of dollars” in payment fees; and the state of Texas is preparing to buy $10 million worth of bitcoin as an investment.
“A bunch” of the top 10 players in the traditional financial services space are looking to get into crypto, Kraken’s other co-CEO, David Ripley, recently told CNBC. “And we’re having a lot of discussions with them on how we can help them pull that off.”
Incorporating versus arriving
With crypto having its moment in the spotlight, Wyoming leaders are hoping the state’s time has come as well. Steve Lupien, the director of UW’s Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation, noted the state has been working to pave the way for the digital asset industry for a “long time” — since 2017.
“… Sometimes we’ve kind of said, ‘Gee, it shouldn’t be this hard. I wish it would happen faster,’” Lupien said. “But it’s starting to happen now.”
He said “thousands” of entities in the digital asset space have domiciled in Wyoming in recent years. Some, like Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson, have also built deep connections in the state. Other firms aren’t based here, but have people living and working remotely in the state.
However, in many cases, the only thing “Wyoming” LLCs and more crypto-focused decentralized autonomous organizations, commonly referred to as DAOs, do here is hire a registered agent to serve as their public face and pay the Secretary of State’s Office an initial $100 fee and then $60 annually.
Kaufman has spent 18 years helping people form companies in Wyoming, and he acknowledged that new filings don’t always mean new business in the state.
“But what I would say, in my experience, is one follows the other,” he said.

Many times, Kaufman said, a company that forms some Wyoming LLCs decides to do more, such as make a deal or open an office here. Between the state’s status as a leader for incorporations, a new chancery court dedicated to expeditiously handling business disputes and the ongoing work on digital assets, “it starts to move the needle to where people say, ‘OK, this makes more and more sense, and we’re going to go ahead and move,’” Kaufman said.
“Over time,” he said, “that momentum continues to build.”
What’s in a move?
Digital asset companies tend to be “decentralized,” and Kraken, which has employees in over 70 countries, doesn’t appear to be bringing a huge swath of new workers to Cheyenne.
“In accordance with our remote-first operating model Kraken has historically eschewed large, physical offices,” a company spokesperson told WyoFile.
Kraken, which has significantly reduced its workforce over the past couple of years, had 45 open jobs around the time of the announcement; 42 were fully remote while two were based in Washington, D.C., and one in San Francisco.
A Kraken spokesperson said the company doesn’t disclose how many people it employs in Wyoming, “to protect their privacy and the security of our business.”
However, co-CEO Sethi described the establishment of the headquarters as a “long-term investment” in Wyoming and said he’ll personally be “looking for a place in the Jackson area, because proximity matters.”
Rothfuss said the digital asset industry isn’t one that brings, say, 1,000 manufacturing jobs to one place, but he believes Kraken’s move will mean an increased in-person presence.
“We do know that as that ecosystem builds out, it does create more and more businesses and more and more opportunities that generate real jobs and real work in Wyoming,” Rothfuss added, “and we’ve seen that.”

Kraken is a big fish in the crypto world, ranking as the second-largest exchange in the United States. It generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year and is reportedly taking steps toward going public.
Beyond facilitating the sales of scores of crypto tokens, the company secures digital assets for institutional customers, and began offering traditional stock and ETF trading earlier this year. More recently, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader to offer futures trading and launched a new global payments app.
“We’re building a platform that goes beyond crypto trading — it powers the next era of global finance,” Sethi wrote earlier this year.
Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the oldest digital asset companies around, and “they’ve just developed an incredibly impressive reputation in the industry,” said Kaufman.
Rothfuss believes Kraken could now be the most valuable company based in Wyoming.
Krakenite culture
Like many tech firms, Kraken was previously based in San Francisco. However, the business shuttered its headquarters there in 2022, citing not only its remote-first approach but also the city’s “out of control” crime, mental illness and drug abuse.
“San Francisco is not safe and will not be safe until we have a [District Attorney] who puts the rights of law abiding citizens above those of the street criminals he so ingloriously protects,” Kraken’s founder and then-CEO, Jesse Powell, said in a statement at the time. 
The DA in question, Chesa Boudin, was later recalled by voters.
Powell is known for his libertarian views, drawing headlines for his sharp criticism of what he sees as “woke” concepts. Amid some internal disagreements over the company’s culture in 2022, he and Kraken released a document outlining its philosophy. It includes a commitment to liberty, due process, personal property rights and limited government.

For instance, Kraken says it: honors workers’ rights to “bodily autonomy,” such as by rejecting vaccine mandates; leaves it up to employees as to whether they want to use their coworkers’ preferred pronouns; hires strictly on merit rather than through “stereotypical team diversity measurements”; and may offer firearm and self-defense training at its corporate retreats.
Kraken cautions prospective employees that its culture may not be the right fit for every potential job applicant, but also emphasizes that “crypto is for everyone.”
“All are welcome to join the revolution,” the document says.
Politics move on-chain
Crypto was born out of a kind of libertarian ethos and a distrust of institutions, from governments to traditional banks. That’s reflected in the very design of blockchains — ledgers that are intended to be “transparent, immutable and resistant to tampering,” as Investopedia puts it.
Those in the space have generally kept politicians and partisan politics at arms’ length. But the conversation about crypto has become more partisan in recent years, following a regulatory “crackdown” by the Biden administration that the industry viewed as unfair and Donald Trump’s pivot from crypto critic to cheerleader and participant.
The industry responded to Trump’s embrace with a flood of campaign contributions. Kraken co-founder Powell gave the president $1 million worth of crypto last summer and the company itself chipped in $1 million to his inaugural committee, alongside other crypto firms and traditional corporate giants like Pfizer, Verizon and Toyota.

Since taking office, Trump has followed through on his promises to make the federal government more crypto-friendly, with his Securities and Exchange Commission dropping suits against and probes of numerous exchanges, including Kraken.
Under the new administration, Kraken also relaunched a staking service, which is a way for customers to receive passive income on their crypto holdings. Biden’s SEC had shut down the service and imposed a $30 million penalty on the company in 2023 — actions that Kraken viewed as “politically motivated.” In March, co-CEO Sethi said he believed Trump had helped “shift crypto from a partisan debate to a shared national interest.”
A polarizing president
But not everyone sees it that way.
Beyond backing the industry, Trump and his family members have launched — and profited from — various crypto ventures over the past year. Trump recently disclosed that he’s earned over $57 million from one of those endeavors. And in May, he hosted a private VIP reception and dinner for those who bought the largest quantities of his $TRUMP memecoin — a move that gave “pause” to even supporters like U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who’s a leading voice on digital assets.
Concerns about the president’s involvement with crypto were apparently one factor behind Senate Democrats’ early May vote to oppose the GENIUS Act, a Lummis-backed measure that aims to create a regulatory framework for asset-backed cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. The bill was backed by members from both parties up until the 48-49 vote, largely along party lines.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of the industry’s harshest critics, told reporters that the bill would put both national security and the broader economy at risk and “supercharge Donald Trump’s corruption.”
Rothfuss compliments the administration’s work to loosen some of the regulations on the industry, but said Trump’s personal projects are “just utterly poisoning the well.”
“It’s now becoming harder for national-level Democrats to support digital assets,” Rothfuss said, “because their constituents are seeing the fraudulent actions of the president, and associating that not just with the president, but with digital assets.”

He’s even been hearing more concerns among Wyoming Democrats about the space. “That’s a headwind that is disappointing to have to deal with.”
(The White House has said the president attended the dinner on his personal time, isn’t involved in the management of his assets and is following federal ethics rules.)
Seeking bipartisanship
Despite the initial setback, the GENIUS Act ultimately cleared the Senate by a 68-30 vote, winning the support of 18 Democrats.
During a late June subcommittee hearing to discuss an overarching market structure for digital assets, Lummis emphasized that she wants to “make sure that we continue to have a bipartisan discussion.”
The veteran lawmaker also said she was unsure why the topic has become more partisan.
“Maybe this is about concern that certain people that have family members in the [Trump] administration are going to be advantaged in some way by what we’re doing,” Lummis said, but “I don’t want that to be the case. I want everybody to be advantaged.”

The Wyoming Legislature has also prided itself on a bipartisan approach. Rothfuss, who’s one of only eight Democrats in the body, and Rep. Daniel Singh, a Cheyenne Republican and member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, underscored that cooperation in a May op-ed.
“Our collaborative efforts in the Wyoming Legislature, alongside Lummis’ leadership in Washington, show that Republicans and Democrats can navigate complex issues together,” the co-chairs of the state blockchain committee wrote, “crafting policies that protect consumers, foster innovation and strengthen America’s position in the global digital economy.”
Internal and external headwinds
Of course, not everyone is on board. Wyoming’s pursuit of the crypto and digital asset industry has drawn skepticism from all ends of the political spectrum, and some question the whole thing. At a recent blockchain committee meeting, retired geoscientist Kerry Aggen of Buffalo told the panel that, “the term digital asset is an oxymoron: Anything digital does not actually exist in real life.”
The complicated nature of the technology and esoteric nature of some of the legislation are also hurdles. At the same committee meeting, Rep. Lee Filer, R-Cheyenne, said it was tough to explain a set of proposed changes to the state’s crypto-focused banks — Special Purpose Deposition Institutions that are abbreviated as SPDIs or “speedies” — to his colleagues in the House.
“There’s many that just don’t understand it,” said Filer, who runs a bitcoin mining operation. “Eyes were glazed over.”

The industry has also received several black eyes from bad actors, hacks and exploits.
Crypto tends to run in boom-and-bust cycles, and a hyperbolic rise in token prices in 2020 and 2021 was followed by a massive crash — and subsequent implosion of several multi-billion dollar enterprises. That included the crypto exchange FTX and lending platform Celsius, which were revealed to have treated their customers’ deposits like their own play money; the leaders of both platforms are now serving federal prison sentences for fraud.
Rothfuss argues that an outfit like FTX “couldn’t have gotten away with it” here, noting the safeguards in place for SPDIs. Wyoming’s regulations attract good actors and keep bad ones out, he said — unlike other states where companies “can just do as they see fit.”
More crypto competition
The increased interest in digital assets across the country has brought Wyoming more competition for the industry’s attention.
Robert Slater, a director of an SPDI called Commercium Financial, told lawmakers in May that the shift in sentiment has led some potential investors and customers to explore other options in Texas, New York and South Dakota. 
Barriers are also being lifted at the federal level: While Slater expressed continued optimism, he said new FDIC guidance allowing traditional banks to get involved with digital assets — potentially with fewer requirements than a SPDI — makes it “harder to champion the story of ‘why Wyoming.’”
Rothfuss said he and other state leaders long expected that large institutions would resist digital assets “right up until they wanted to make money,” at which point they would try to shut out Wyoming and its SPDIs.
“So nothing we’re seeing is surprising,” he said, “and we’ll keep trying to position ourselves in a leadership role.”
Both Rothfuss and Kaufman believe the state remains ahead of the pack, thanks to its years of work on the nitty-gritty details. In Kraken’s announcement of its new Cheyenne headquarters, Lummis said the move reinforced Wyoming’s position as “America’s premier crypto hub.”
Cody Carbone, the CEO of The Digital Chamber, indicated there are similar opinions among the more than 200 blockchain companies that his D.C.-based organization represents.
“Yes, everyone is very bullish on Wyoming,” Carbone said in an email. “It’s still viewed as the foundational jurisdiction for crypto regulation.”

That could change, he said, but Wyoming is “very attractive” to crypto companies that rely on remote work and want to leverage the state’s reputation, regulatory framework and tax incentives.
“I think Wyoming will always be successful,” Carbone said, “because the State is nimble enough to continuously innovate.”
The limits of small multitudes
Wyoming does, however, remain limited in its ability to recruit businesses by having the smallest population in the union.
The country’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, also nixed its San Francisco headquarters in 2021. However, as Kraken decided to anchor itself in Cheyenne, Coinbase reestablished itself in the Bay Area city by leasing a massive, 150,000-square-foot office space.
Asked why the company would set up shop in tax-heavy California, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said many of their employees live there.
“We go to where the talent is,” Armstrong wrote on X.
His comment would seem to fit with Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell’s experience — that companies care more about a vibrant workforce than low taxes.
“I have worked with and for countless companies that have very seriously looked at wanting to come to Wyoming, and they want to be here,” Kaufman said, “but when the rubber meets the road, it’s like, ‘Gosh, there’s not a good option for a place to put 100 people — and we don’t know that the labor force is there for us to hire 100 people as quickly as we need.’” 
While frustrating, “it is what it is,” he said, “and that’s why … I think we have to expect wins over time.”
Lupien, however, is quick to argue that Wyoming has a lot to offer to the digital asset industry, even when it comes to the workforce. UW is one of the only Division I universities in the country offering a minor in blockchain — about 120 students go through the program each year — and he burnished the programs offered by the College of Engineering and School of Computing.
Lupien also heralded Wyoming’s quality of life, saying the more time people spend in the state, the more they come to appreciate it.
“I think Wyoming can compete,” he said, “and obviously it has in the case of Kraken.”

[…]","A clearcut logging project near Helena, Montana (Photo courtesy of Vicki Anfinson, used with permission). When George Ochenski warns that conservation groups sometimes trade their spines for a seat at the table, he taps into a frustration every public-lands hunter knows: Deals can slide from compromise to concession in a hurry. Yet his July 4 column paints Backcountry Hunters & Anglers with a brush so broad it obscures the facts.
One week before the column ran, the U.S. Department of Agriculture erased the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule and exposed 58 million acres of undeveloped forest to new roads and logging. Within hours BHA blasted the decision as “a blatant rejection of 24 years of bipartisan stewardship,” urged Congress to restore the rule, and asked its 40,000 members to mobilize during the public-comment period. That is not silence; it is the opening salvo of a fight that will last well beyond this news cycle.
Nor is the rollback an isolated case.
In 2022 BHA’s Montana chapter sued the Forest Service when the agency tried to cede public-access easements in the Crazy Mountains—litigation funded largely by small donors and squarely opposed by local timber interests. Idaho members recently flooded congressional offices with calls that helped stall a bill to sell public land to private developers. Grass-roots lawyering and lobbying are hard to square with the notion of a compromised collaborator.
So what about “collaboration?”
After catastrophic fire seasons, some cross-boundary thinning is biologically defensible; some is not. The difference lies in the details, which is why BHA publishes comment guides that prod hunters and anglers to demand site-specific science, cumulative-effects analysis, and intact wildlife-security zones before a chainsaw or dozer fires up. That posture forces both agencies and industry to earn public consent.
Ochenski also resurrects a 2011 congressional rider that delisted wolves in the Northern Rockies. BHA had no national staff in 2011. Today its wildlife policy states that management decisions must be grounded in science and executed through administrative processes, not legislative shortcuts. In practice that stance has meant opposing Idaho’s wolf-bounty program, challenging predator-killing bills in Alaska, and supporting balanced harvest quotas in Colorado.
Claims that BHA is driven by “foundation millions” likewise miss the mark. Audited financials show that 78 percent of its $9.2 million Fiscal Year 2023 budget went directly to program work; individual memberships and grass-roots events, not foundation grants, generated the largest share of revenue. Transparency doesn’t guarantee perfect decisions, but it makes it hard to hide a sell-out.
None of this is to deny that collaboration can be abused. When process becomes product, industry actors can dilute conservation outcomes. But collaboration can also lock in gains otherwise stalled by litigation or partisanship—the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act and the North Fork Protection Act both moved because unlikely allies hammered out durable terms. BHA backed each deal because it expanded habitat and public access, not because it was fashionable in philanthropic circles.
The lesson is simple: Conservation victories require coalitions that stretch beyond any single demographic—hunters, anglers, Tribal communities, recreationists, and even commodity producers willing to meet halfway. The alternative is fractured interest groups firing from ideological redoubts while intact habitat erodes in real time.
Ochenski’s anger at backsliding agencies is justified; his broadside against fellow conservationists is not. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers stands ready to fight for roadless areas, science-based wildlife management, and transparent public processes—precisely the values he champions. By all means hold the group accountable, but let’s argue on evidence, not assumption. The stakes—clean water, healthy wildlife populations, and the freedom to roam Montana’s wildest country—are too high for friendly fire.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
Indiana stands to lose about $100 million. The Indiana Department of Education has been mum except for saying in a weekly newsletter that additional information “will be shared with schools as we know more about these allocations.”
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

In a statement announcing the pause to states, the U.S. Department of Education said “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.

“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Photo courtesy Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Committee)With the Wisconsin state budget completed just last week, Senate Democrats are gearing up for 2026 elections and their shot at a majority. Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon), surrounded by a group of current Democratic senators, launched her campaign Monday for Senate District 17, currently represented by one of the Senate Republicans central to shaping Wisconsin’s budget. 
There are about 16 months until November 2026 when half of the state Senate, the entire state Assembly and the governor’s seat will all be up for election. This will be the first time the new legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be in place for the 17 odd-numbered Senate seats.
Democrats gained four seats in the Senate in 2024 — breaking the GOP supermajority and leaving Senate Republicans with a margin of 18-15 majority. They will need to win at least three seats if they are to win the majority for the first time in more than 15 years.
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), the co-chair of the powerful budget committee, is the incumbent, having first been elected to the seat in 2014 after serving two terms in the Assembly. 
Lisa White, a Democrat who runs an interior painting business, is also running for the seat.
Jacobson, who is serving her second term in the Assembly, told the Wisconsin Examiner that she is challenging Marklein in part because he hasn’t been listening. 
Marklein won the district with 60% of the vote in 2022, but Senate District 17 changed considerably under the new maps. According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the district leaned Democrat by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by over 4 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
“The biggest thing that I see about this district is that people really want somebody who’s going to represent what they’re fighting for, what they need and listen to them, and even listen to them when they don’t necessarily agree,” Jacobson said. “They’ve been not receiving that in their current state senator.” 
Jacobson cited a report in the Monroe Times of a Marklein listening session in Belleville in January — coincidentally on the same day that Jacobson was holding one there. 
“There was a list of rules of what would and will not be happening in that listening session,” Jacobson said. “That, to me, is the starkest example of what it means to listen to your community, because I was inviting anybody… there are no rules. I’m open to having a conversation with anybody at any time.”
Marklein’s notice told residents that it was “designed for the senator to receive input and ideas about issues facing residents in the 17th Senate District” and he didn’t “plan to answer questions, debate ideas, challenge the ideas, or otherwise comment because he is seeking to hear every point-of-view equally.” The notice said that “the goal is for every attendee to feel comfortable sharing their input.” It also advised those attending that  their comments might be subject to a time limit. 
Jacobson launched her campaign outside an elementary school in Ridgeway that was closed after the Dodgeville school district combined two elementary schools into one. She called Marklein a “classic politician” who she said has “failed” the Senate district. 
“Our district has time and again been forced into referenda to fund our schools because Howard Marklein has chosen power over people,” Jacobson said. “He has chosen ideology over voting for the needs of the district. That is irresponsible governing.” 
Jacobson first ran for the state Assembly for an open seat in 2021 and said her service on the Oregon village board showed her how local government intersects with state government and why it’s important to shape the latter.
Her announcement came less than a week after lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers completed the state budget. The Republicans’ narrower Senate majority led to a new dynamic during the budget process. With Democratic votes necessary to pass the bill, Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) became involved in budget negotiations.
Hesselbein joined Jacobson at her campaign announcement Monday, along with Sens. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska). 
Jacobson has been fighting for public school funding, Hesselbein said. “In the Senate, she will dedicate herself to lowering costs for your families, to creating a bright future for your children, and making our state stronger every day,” Hesselbein said. “We are excited and proud to be standing behind her in this campaign and we look forward to her joining us and helping us win a Democratic majority.”
Jacobson voted against the budget, joining 37 other Assembly Democrats.
Democrats credited the new maps and the Senate’s closer margins for the budget agreement, which included an increase in funding for special education, the University of Wisconsin system and child care. The bill passed thanks to five Senate Democratic votes, although a recurring theme among Democrats whether they voted for or against the budget, including Jacobson, was that it wasn’t perfect. 
Jacobson said that was part of the reason she launched her campaign. 
“I was hoping under these new maps — with even more voices talking so loudly about the fact that they need state assistance when it comes to affording child care, they need more funding for our schools, they need real help on the everyday costs that are facing Wisconsinites — that under this new more competitive district that would be represented in the state budget,” she said. “What we’re seeing is that the cycle of referendums is not going to end under this budget… and that was a missed opportunity in this budget.” 
During the final discussions over the budget, Marklein emphasized that the document was a “compromise” between Republicans and Democrats while highlighting items affecting his district, such as funding for the UW system that would help the Platteville campus. Marklein did not respond to an email from the Wisconsin Examiner on Monday asking about his 2026 plans and his response to Democrats targeting SD 17.
Jacobson said she doesn’t view Marklein’s long tenure as a state lawmaker as a challenge. She said she is more concerned with the size of the Southwest Wisconsin Senate district, which encompasses Iowa, Lafayette, Green, Crawford and Grant counties as well as parts of Dane County.
“It’s a big district, but the benefit of that is that it’s filled with these amazing rural communities that when people think about Wisconsin that’s what they think of…,” Jacobson said. “Sure [Sen. Marklein has] been an incumbent for a while, but has he been out? How much is he doing outside of walking a parade to really listen to the district?” 
Jacobson, a mother of three children, said public education funding will be one of her top issues, though she is also more concerned about hearing from others. She said she has been traveling the district over the last few weeks and hearing an array of concerns from residents.
“They’re concerned that they’re going to have to have more referenda because of the lack of school funding to increase their property taxes even more,” Jacobson said. “They’re concerned that without meaningful work or support from the state — our health care system in that area… seven hospitals… multiple clinics — those are going to potentially be in jeopardy.”

As Southwest District Health plans buildings and finance needs for the future, the regional public health district is asking the public to weigh in.
An anonymous survey, available online in English and Spanish, is open throughout the summer to people who live in the district. The public health district includes six counties in southwestern Idaho: Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties.
But more public input opportunities are expected throughout the planning process.
“We want to ensure our services, facilities and financial planning reflect the needs of our communities,” Southwest District Health Director Nikole Zogg said in a statement. “This process is about making strategic decisions that are informed and supported by the communities we serve and shaping the future of public health services in Southwest Idaho.”
The health district expects to present the new master facility plan in early 2026, which will include evaluations of the district’s existing facilities, utilization and areas for improvement, Southwest District Health announced in a news release on Monday. That plan will consider potentially relocating or expanding facilities, and how to address barriers to accessing services, such as from transportation or technology. 
Find more information about Southwest District Health’s planning process online, at swdh.id.gov/about/master-facilities-plan. The health district is working with Clearwater Financial as a planning partner.

Faith Howard’s literacy lab classes helped older students make huge comprehension gains. Now she is working to spread the teaching method across Wyoming, where literacy has been a concern for years.
The post This Pinedale teacher’s approach is helping high school students fill reading gaps appeared first on WyoFile .","In her Pinedale High School literacy lab classroom, Faith Howard prompted her students to decipher an excerpt from the criminal justice memoir “Just Mercy.”
Howard, blonde and energetic in that caffeinated way of teachers, encouraged them to decode words by breaking them into segments and blending the sounds. She had them search for instances of the “bossy R” or “vowel teams,” focus on what prefixes and suffixes could tell them about the words and keep an eye out for other morphemes — like Greek or Latin roots — that could hint at meaning. 
Howard identified one particularly tricky word for them to study. One of her students, a freshman girl with a thick braid who is on an individualized education plan for special learning needs, examined it before attempting to pronounce it. She was quiet and hesitant, but correct.
“Is it coerced?” another student called out loudly.
“Yes,” Howard responded. “Coerced. Repeat it after me.” 
They all did so, this time without hesitation. 
Later, they read the text aloud, confidently pronouncing words like “incarcerated,” “redacted,” and, once again, “coerced.”
A casual observer wouldn’t pin the students as struggling readers — and that’s evidence Howard’s approach to literacy is working. 
When Howard was hired to help improve literacy in Pinedale high schools three years ago, she said, the nut she had to crack was this: How could she help struggling older readers without insulting their intelligence with literacy material designed for 5-year-olds?
Howard started from scratch. She developed her own curriculum based on the science of reading — an evidence-based body of knowledge on effective literacy instruction — and called her class “literacy lab.”
She incorporated fluency, comprehension, vocabulary and writing — but in the context of current events, more complicated language and the kinds of topics that engage high schoolers.

And in just two years, Pinedale High School saw a 79% drop in students reading below basic, and a 55% increase in those reaching proficient or advanced.
“It is proving to be really valuable,” Howard said. 
In a state with nagging literacy concerns as proficiency scores tick downward, Howard hopes to share her insights with other Wyoming educators. 
“I’ve kind of made it my mission,” she said, “really trying to crack the code on: What can we do so that we’re not graduating kids from high school who really don’t have the tools to be successful, even if they don’t go to college?”
A second teaching education 
Howard spent 16 years as a high school English teacher, assigning reading texts, grading essays and instructing on writing skills. Her family moved to Wyoming from  Colorado six years ago when she took a teaching job in Big Piney. Three years later, she was hired as a literacy specialist in Pinedale, where Sublette County School District 1 obtained federal grant money through the state to improve literacy scores. 
Pinedale High School students had historically tested well in reading compared to the rest of the state, she said. But in 2021, nearly 30% of 9th graders were reading below basic proficiency in standardized testing. Howard was enlisted to help turn that trend around. 
And that is where her second education began. As an English teacher, she said, she specialized in general classroom instruction, rather than the skills needed to teach students how to read.
“Secondary education teaching programs and teachers in general, for older students, are not taught any of this,” she said. 
At first, she worked with individual students who struggled. She realized, however, it wasn’t enough to just help students complete writing homework or study for English tests. 
“If I’m just helping them pass classes to graduate, we haven’t actually addressed the underlying issue,” Howard said. “So that’s when I said, ‘I need more training.’”

That included several sessions with the Institute for Multi-Sensory Education, which offers instruction on the science of reading through courses like morphology — the study of word structure — and phonological awareness, which has to do with spoken sentences.
Howard leaned into training, and learned the intricacies of literacy. She also realized that she faced a challenge. While literacy instruction for struggling readers is generally aimed at young children, many kids, she said, mask their problems and slip through the cracks.
To present older kids with rudimentary instruction designed for small children, Howard knew, wouldn’t work.
So she started working with small student groups and marrying morphology and reading fluency. “And immediately saw an uptick and success,” she said. “And that was only a piece of the pie.”
Howard expanded that with comprehension, writing and discussion. Her literacy lab class was born. 
Opting in 
“I’m basically doing targeted instruction to fill in the gaps of what students missed from elementary school without putting them in front of like, baby books,” Howard said in summarizing the class. As the students gain foundational tools, they also talk about current events, learn the meaning of complicated words and examine age-appropriate texts. 
The class is an elective. Students who qualify for literacy services or who have other indicators of reading challenges are invited. It can be a hard sell, she said, particularly as kids have to be willing to give up something like art or PE to take it. 
But within a year of the lab’s launch, the data began to confirm its success; today, the school’s “below basic” scores have plummeted to single digits. That has helped sway students and parents. Some kids, she said, even choose to remain in the literacy lab after they meet the exit criteria. 
Sublette County School District 1 Curriculum Director Greg Legerski oversaw the literacy grant and worked closely with Howard. The district had to pivot significantly to address literacy, he said. “Faith really embraced that challenge.”
Howard’s receptivity to learning and adapting is unique, Legerski said. 
“She really had an immense thirst for professional growth,” he said. “She was continually seeking out opportunities and refining her craft. She always wanted to grow as an educator.”

When she learned something new, Legerski said, she would seek feedback to check her work, and happily share her knowledge with others. The impact has been remarkable, he said.
“She took that current research and really transformed it into something that’s practical, impactful and really changing the lives of students within the classroom,” he said. “She’s done an outstanding job.”
Literacy landscape 
It’s not news that Wyoming reading scores have ticked down in recent years. In 2024, 36% of fourth graders and 29% of eighth graders performed at or above the proficient level in reading on national standardized NAEP tests, lower than the previous five years. 
Some 32% of Wyoming fourth graders performed below basic, which was a slight increase from 29% in 2022. For eighth graders, 30% scored below basic in 2024, up one percentage point from 2022. 
Wyoming’s scores hovered above the rest of the country; the state has long ranked comparatively high in national testing. But literacy challenges are widespread, Howard noted. 
“People across the country have been struggling with the same things,” she said. “We’re getting kids in middle and high schools that really do not know how to read very well, and they’re missing all of these core components from elementary school, those foundational reading skills.”

Thanks to reporting from journalists like Emily Hanford, awareness of widespread reading instruction failures has also grown. Hanford’s podcast “Sold a Story” exposed how educators across the country believed they were teaching a best-practice approach to reading that was later disproven.
The results Howard has seen in Pinedale, she said, are evidence that with the right method, even those students who slipped through for years can gain the crucial skills. Educational band-aids will just fail kids, she said. 
“If you don’t address the underlying issue, it’s always going to be there, and the gap is just going to widen even more because the text levels get more and more difficult,” she said. 
“It’s a good time to be in this work,” she said, “because you can have such a huge impact if you’re able to find something that works.”
More alarm bells 
The Legislature’s Joint Education Committee has made K-3 literacy a priority topic for the interim, or off-season, for six years running. 
In May, a group of mothers attended the committee’s Casper meeting to urge it to act in a meaningful way. Their testimonies illuminated how kids here end up lacking literacy tools well into their school years. 
Annie McGlothlin’s son went through nearly three years of school before his dyslexia was identified, she said, and it’s been an ongoing struggle to fight for the right interventions. It’s time for Wyoming to overhaul literacy to reflect the science of reading in a way that’s uniform and rigorous, she said.
Chandel Pine’s son, Paul, struggled in school starting from day one, she testified. He repeated kindergarten, received reading interventions and was diagnosed with ADHD, and was behind his peers for most of his life, she said. Despite the challenges, her son presented as an OK reader and passed subsequent grades.
It wasn’t until fifth grade that the scope of his reading deficiency was identified, she said, and that was after she specifically requested an IEP. 
“He was in the third percentile in reading for his age,” she said. Paul committed suicide that year in school. 
The women urged lawmakers to mandate early and ongoing dyslexia screening for grades K-12 and strengthen teacher training and certifications for literacy interventions, among other things.

A challenge, committee members said, is trying to impose a statewide system on Wyoming districts, which have broad local autonomy. 
Still, Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, proposed a bill to amend Wyoming statute provisions related to identifying and addressing struggling students. His bill would sharpen definitions, mandate better tracking and create an avenue for parents to appeal to the Wyoming superintendent of public instruction. The bill would also create a small statewide team of staff to focus on literacy needs. The committee voted to advance the draft.
Organic expansion
Howard will expand her labs into the Pinedale Middle School next year. She is also intent on sharing what she’s learned with other educators. 
“It’s just a total passion project for me, and something that I’m trying to get the word out about because I do think that there are other districts and other states that are looking for answers,” Howard said. “I don’t have all the answers, but I think I’ve figured out a few things that could really help kids in other places too.”
She has presented at Wyoming’s literacy conference for three years, led virtual trainings and sits on the leadership committee for a group of Wyoming educators who are looking to learn more about literacy. She also welcomes educators to visit and observe her labs.
For other districts looking to pursue a similar program, Curriculum Director Legerski said, it’s doable. It just takes prioritizing literacy by hiring specialists or finding the right teacher who is willing to receive additional training. 
“It’s really scalable, across many schools,” he said.

Wyoming doesn’t need more voter registration laws just because the secretary of state claims our system is in need of a fix, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Can we stop pretending that ‘election integrity’ was ever a real problem?   appeared first on WyoFile .","Restoring “election integrity” is the issue that keeps on winning for Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the Republican Party.

Opinion

It’s a cynical political game that exists not to solve a real problem, but serves to stir up Gray’s base of extremist voters and boost his overall popularity for his long-rumored run for the governor’s office next year.
Now, the U.S. Department of Justice and red states that want to intervene on Gray’s behalf in a federal lawsuit are playing into that scenario by supposedly confirming that Wyomingites are justified in thinking the state’s election system is vulnerable to voter fraud and noncitizens voting.
The Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, sued Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks in May over the constitutionality of that new law requiring proof from those registering to vote that they are United States citizens who have lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days.
U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl has since ruled that county officials are nominal parties who will technically remain a part of the case but have no responsibilities.
Wyoming’s county clerks do a remarkably effective job running our elections and are not responsible for the potentially harmful changes Gray and the GOP-led Legislature made to the state’s election statutes. 


County clerks try to ensure every qualified voter can participate in federal, state and local elections. Republican Party officials across the country have done just the opposite, because the higher the vote totals, the less likely their party will win. 
In its filing, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said the federal court should “maintain the long-held position that preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence are legitimate state interests.”
Of course, it should. But Wyoming had election integrity long before Gray and the far-right Freedom Caucus proposed the new voter registration requirements.
According to the conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation’s database, Wyoming has had only four voter fraud convictions in the past quarter century — and the criminals were all Republicans. Gray has repeatedly charged voter fraud here is more of an issue than the numbers show, which should damage his credibility. Unfortunately, what he claims is accepted as the truth by many voters. 
No restoration of Wyoming’s election integrity is needed, especially from ideologues trying to win favor from President Donald Trump, who still claims he was the victim of a “rigged” 2020 election despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.
In a University of Wyoming survey conducted before the November 2024 election, nearly 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president to be very or somewhat reliable. Voter confidence in our elections is not a problem state law needs to address.
There is little evidence that non-citizens are attempting to vote in Wyoming elections, which was already a crime. This is a textbook case of a solution in search of a problem.
Gray indicated in many instances, but not all, a valid driver’s license will suffice for proof of identity, residency and U.S. citizenship as long as they list a Wyoming address. 
But the suit identifies subsets of the population — including young, low-income, already underrepresented voters, domestic abuse and sexual assault survivors, and women who changed their names after marriage — who will likely discover that obtaining the proper documentation means navigating “a labyrinth of bureaucracy,” all with costs and delays as election day nears. 
If people who want to vote begin their search too late, or become frustrated with the amount of time and money it takes, they may scrap the whole process and be disenfranchised altogether. That’s hardly the desired outcome in a democratic republic that values individual voter rights.

A huge chunk of the MAGA universe wants to help defend the handiwork of Gray and the bill’s Freedom Caucus sponsor, Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, against the liberal elites and “Republicans in name only” who want it thrown out.
The Republican National Committee maintained in its filing that as elected officials Gray and the county clerks represent the public interest, but don’t adequately represent the GOP’s “inherently partisan” interests. Therefore, the party argues, it should be allowed to intervene in the suit.
Why? Because if the court rules against the new law the party “would need to divert resources from other mission-critical activities towards get-out-the-vote activities to reinsure Republican voter trust in Wyoming’s electoral system.”
Sure, federal courts always prioritize keeping a political party’s “mission-critical activities” on course. How can the RNC keep its budget straight if it first spends money to scare the bejesus out of voters telling them noncitizens are stealing elections, and then has to waste even more dough trying to convince its own members that it really is safe to vote?
Meanwhile, 25 red states and Guam, a U.S. territory, have filed an amicus brief that urges the court to deny the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The brief claims the ESPC hasn’t identified “an actual, real-life individual who is eligible and wishes to become a Wyoming voter but cannot feasibly prove his or her citizenship.”
The cold is pushing most to huddle inside, but hasn’t kept away voters from Spring Creek School in Laramie where wait times to vote have held steady at around an hour. (Mike Vanata/WyoFile)
I find the ESPC’s response to the brief more compelling: “[While] all states may posture during legislative sessions (or in amicus briefs) about the specter of non-citizen voting, the fact remains that there is no evidence that it is an actual problem — in Wyoming or anywhere else — and the amici tellingly point to none.”
I think the court should take into consideration Gov. Mark Gordon’s reasoning in letting the Gray/Bear collaboration become law without his signature. The governor didn’t use this phrase, but it’s what he probably meant: It’s downright goofy.
Gordon wrote that the law instructs county clerks to accept a prospective voter’s proof of citizenship so long as it doesn’t contain “any indication” that the person isn’t a U.S. citizen.
“This standard may be difficult for clerks to administer, as it is unclear and perhaps awkward for our county clerks to consistently apply with any degree of certainty,” he concluded.
The lawsuit said the law should be “void for vagueness” because it “both fails to allow persons of ordinary intelligence to anticipate how the law will be enforced and invites arbitrary enforcement.”
All true. Gray and Bear obviously had many months to produce a bill that would pass constitutional muster. If this ambiguous concoction is the best they can do to solve a supposedly major problem, why shouldn’t a judge tell them it’s a failure?

Tucked away in the back of the Hayden Super 1 Shopping Center is The Village Bakery. Its four-year presence has been a rock of strength and acceptance for the special needs community, providing meaningful employment and hands-on training.
“We are more of a school and teaching, not only baking skills, but also life skills that our special needs workers will be able to take with them on their journey,” Dana Bellefeuille said. She and her husband, Todd, a Spokane Valley firefighter, own the North Idaho business, which is much more than a place to buy eats and treats.
“It’s not just a bakery. It’s a bakery with a purpose,” Todd Bellefeuille said.
And that purpose hits close to home and touches their hearts deeply. Dana Bellefeuille herself struggled with dyslexia growing up. She and her husband raised a son and daughter with special needs who are living well in the area.
 Navigating the real world 

The Village Bakery’s mission of “transforming lives by empowering the special needs community” is a critical one for the success of this population, which often faces barriers entering the workforce and then significant hurdles retaining jobs.

According to 2024 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 70 million U.S. adults across the country have a disability, which is approximately one in four adults.
“We are talking about humans here, and a lot of them are on the autism spectrum,” Dana Bellefeuille explained. “We find out what do they want to do in life, what skills they want to work on and what they are drawn to in the bakery. Basically, what really lights their fire! It’s fun.”
 Keeping the doors open

When asked how she got into the bakery business, Dana Bellefeuille smiled.
“It’s Todd’s fault. He got this brilliant idea when our babies were little that we could make a wedding cake for his sister,” she said. “I was hooked from that moment.” The rest is history.
The Village Bakery is surviving financially and thriving in its mission, but it “hasn’t been an easy journey” since they were handed the keys, they said. Neither of them takes a salary.
“The bakery industry is one of the hardest to keep open. Most of them fail in the first few years,” Todd Bellefeuille said.
His wife agreed and shared their challenges.
“Being open for four years now is stellar, [and] we have been able to pay all the bills, but [we’re] barely skating by,” Dana Bellefeuille added.
 Creating a culture of care and value

Dana Bellefeuille oversees the daily operations and keeps the storefront doors open with 25 paid employees and countless volunteers by her side. She said approximately 90% of her workers have special needs and disabilities.
Six days a week The Village Bakery welcomes employees, volunteers and customers to its doors for a dose of humanity, kindness and lots of smiles — acceptance and inclusion are its pillars of pride.
“I want people to be who they are here. Explore, not be afraid, feel welcomed,” she said. “There are not a lot of places in the world like this, but I’m hoping we can change that.”
She also wants to inspire and offer opportunities.
“We want to be that example of what can be. We have over 50,000 TikTok followers,” Dana Bellefeuille said. “We want to show parents what is possible — that there are places across the United States that will love and honor your child for who they are, and they will be part of something.”
 Saving a life

Abigail Foster, a full-time volunteer at the bakery, can be described as Dana Bellefeuille’s key person. Foster has been by her side for about eight years now.
“I’ve worked here since the beginning,” Foster said. “I have been with Dana before the name was even chosen. I took her classes (in Dana Bellefeuille’s home), and that is how I really got to know her.”

“I lured her in with cupcakes,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
Foster is a veteran and was medically discharged due to spine injuries. Meeting Dana Bellefeuille saved her life, Foster said.
“My life wasn’t going the way I wanted it to go. My spine is fusing into one piece. This mentally destroyed me. I was in a super, super dark place. It was just somewhere I didn’t want to be,” Foster said. “I was ready to jump off wherever I needed to jump off to go away. But I didn’t because of her.”
Foster continues to struggle with her depression, but Dana Bellefeuille is there each day with support.
“She always tells me, ‘You just need to come to work. It melts away the worries. Come here for the smell, laughs and smiles.’”
 Her heart goes beyond the bakery

Dana Bellefeuille shared a story of a young man that came to her looking for a job.
“I was completely booked with people and didn’t have a job for him. But we sat down and had a meal and had a human-to-human conversation,” she said. “I thanked him for coming in. I told him I would let him know if anything opened up.”
A week later his grandparents stopped by, and they were crying. She asked how she could help. They thanked her for not hiring their grandson, explaining, however, that her talk with him had helped him feel valued and built up his courage. So the following week he went out and got a job at a pizza restaurant that he loves.
“That is what I want to do for everybody here — show them that they are valued, they are loved and they are needed in this world. And they have a place in society,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
 Keeping positive momentum

As the story of The Village Bakery unfolds, the lives it continues to touch keep stacking up, much like the layers on one of her client-ordered cakes with its ornate designs, decorative frosting and mouth-pleasing flavors.
“Having the storefront here has saved multiple lives,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
She shared she firmly believes in the power of God and is a Christian.
“It has been incredible to watch people saved either physically from a physical problem or their emotional state by helping them find Jesus and peace through that process,” she said.
Dana Bellefeuille knows where she belongs, and it feeds her soul as well as others. She is grateful and humbled.
“It is incredible being in this space. I don’t want to be anywhere else,” she said. “I get a front row seat to watch miracles happen every day.”

In small-town Wyoming, more people are taking to Pine Street to wave American flags and signs in support of constitutional rights and shared wide open spaces, Joy Ufford explains. 
The post Pinedale’s grassroots grow along with opposition to selling public lands  appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—A dozen “Honk for Public Lands” signs brought almost 300 enthusiastic responses from drivers (and bikers) traveling through and around Pinedale, including a number of license plates with the 23 prefix for Sublette County. Signs also telegraphed fears that Wyoming’s Congressional Delegation — Rep. Harriet Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis — would “sell out” their constituents.

Opinion

After my unexpected retirement from Wyoming Newspapers 16 months ago, I was eventually invited to participate in local rallies to advocate for constitutional rights — freedom of speech and freedom of the press — and veterans, seniors and families. My journalistic ethics required me to remain on the sidelines, uninvolved (yet free to ask questions). So when I made the decision to participate in speaking out as a private citizen, I did not make it lightly.
After decades as a Sublette County and Wyoming journalist, I still report occasionally for the Pinedale Roundup. I absorbed and melded journalistic ethics with my personal morals, a tendency to question authority and the Golden Rule. 
So being a journalist will likely always shape my eye, heart and mind as a private citizen. I want to ask questions to better understand how my community, friends, neighbors and family (and I) will be affected by policy decisions, at any level of government. I also want to chronicle events with photographs.
On June 28, I didn’t pick up a sign to carry at the rally. Instead, I put on my Wyoming Press Association pass, carried my camera, notebook and pen and identified myself as a reporter. Reporters are scarce in small-town Wyoming. I wanted to capture people’s thoughts at my grass-roots level amid the national uproar over Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s plan to sell off public lands to offset the costs of tax cuts. Here’s what I learned during that June 28 rally from the 50-plus rally goers crowding Pinedale’s main street — Pine Street — waving flags and signs with slogans demanding public lands stay public.

Many described directly contacting Hageman, Barrasso and Lummis to call on them to oppose public land sales and receiving responses benignly accepting Lee’s proposal.
Which public lands are most important to them? “All of them.”
The lack of details, maps and a path for public inclusion bothered Pinedale activist Karla Bird enough to make a presentation to Sublette County elected officials, who sent a letter to the congressional delegation.
Bird first started rallying in February on Pinedale’s main street to register her concerns about the Trump administration. The small weekly gatherings grew, from sometimes drawing just two people to bigger crowds like the 50-plus who showed up June 28. By then, Lee’s proposal had been scaled back, calling for selling off public lands overseen by the Bureau of Land Management within five miles of population centers. 
“Even if Lee only targets the BLM, there are migration corridors that we should have a say in,” Bird said at that rally.
Lee withdrew his plan later that same night, a surrender attributed to widespread, grassroots and bipartisan opposition.
At the June 28 rally, a car pulled up to the sidewalk and a small, fragile woman emerged from the passenger’s seat. Juanita Bertoncelj held out her “sign,” a notebook page with the message that Wyoming’s wild horses, which could be removed soon in BLM roundups, live on public lands.

Likewise, other rally goers worried selling off public lands could harm Sublette County’s wildlife migration corridors and habitat, recreation, solitude, future access and Wyoming way of life.
Sublette County resident Dan Stroud spent much of his career, including three decades with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, working to preserve wildlife habitat. 
“Public lands are imperative for our wildlife’s future,” said Stroud, who has come to the public lands rallies. “They provide summer range, winter range, migration corridors, at least here.”
Summer interns Hannah Peters from Massachusetts and Chloe Smith from Colorado are working on a wildlife research project on BLM land.
“So we have a very personal interest in wildlife,” said Peters, holding a sign that said “Protect Our Public Lands.” 
Smith added: “We wouldn’t want to see public lands privatized and lose access for the people who live here and vacation here.” 
Eric Jahn-Clough, of Maine, came to the rally with a local friend. 
“I’ve come out here to go hiking and fishing for more than 20 years,” Jahn-Clough said. “I’ve spent over 600 nights in the Wind Rivers. I was just in Dinosaur National Monument hiking extensively there and in the Wind Rivers, and I fish in public sections of all these rivers.”
His next camping destination — the Big Sandy.
A Forest Service employee, who asked that his name not be used for fear of retaliation, stressed that Pinedale, Sublette County and Wyoming would not have as much of a draw without public lands, mountains, forests and rivers. 
“Most of the really big things that have happened to me and changed my life were not sitting in my apartment,” he said. “They were experiences I had on the public lands.”
With the fate of 7,000 Forest Service jobs in judicial limbo, fellow employees are cautious, he said. “They’re probably not going to come out and hold a sign on the street, but they are here,” he said.

The June 28 public lands rally was the first in a series of weekly gatherings in Pinedale to be publicly advertised with flyers. (Joy Ufford)
This grassroots rally was the first to be publicly advertised with flyers printed up and posted by activists Bird and Jocelyn Slack with the Women’s Advocacy Group. They and others started DOGE protests, now termed “rallies.” Citizens, federal employees and students — worried about what policies and changes from the Trump administration, Elon Musk and DOGE would affect them — began asking how to participate.
A larger local group coalesced from the initial smaller protests. However, fears of confrontations and retribution from Trump supporters kept publicity at a simmer. Until June, word of mouth and Pinedale activist Kelly Ravner’s growing email list of supporters kept the group feeling safe, but constrained. 
For “No Kings Day” on June 14, social media messaging brought 63 people, young and old, new and usual, to carry American flags and signs. Although hecklers interrupted the event, there were no hints of violence. Ravner congratulated supporters, writing: “Wow! Pinedale really knocked it out of the park on Saturday [June 14]. I was hoping for a good turnout but you exceeded all expectations!”
She noted “no specific plans for the next rally.”
Then the national furor erupted over the proposed public land sales and the Pinedale group decided to make that issue its primary focus for June 21 and again on June 28.
Almost 80 people attended the June 21 rally.
Ravner uses clicker-counters to estimate vehicles traveling in both directions with another person clicking waves, thumbs up and horn honks. On June 21, the positive “approval rating” roughly averaged out to 4 to 10%, of all passing vehicles with plenty of County 23 plates. On June 28, the “approval rating” hovered around 30%.
Karl Kuhn and Jennifer Hockenbery, visiting from eastern Wisconsin, were thrilled to see the June 28 flyer posted in a Pinedale restaurant. They spent five days fishing and camping in the Wyoming Range and hiked from the Pole Creek trailhead. After the rally they planned to explore Half Moon Lake. All on public lands. 
So Kuhn borrowed an extra handmade sign and Hockenbery scrawled her own message to protect public lands on a brown paper bag and joined the long line of people facing the traffic.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening state legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A rush of Republicans and Democrats are likely to run for two open U.S. Congressional seats in Middle Tennessee. 
U.S. Rep Mark Green, a Clarksville Republican, confirmed Monday he is stepping down from his 7th Congressional District seat on July 20, triggering a special election. The 7th district encompasses parts of northern Nashville, Clarksville, and half of Williamson County, as well as about a dozen other Middle Tennessee counties. 
Green announced in 2024 he would not run for reelection but one month later, was persuaded to run again by President Donald Trump. His official resignation comes days after he voted in favor of Trump’s domestic policy bill to cut Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy programs to partially pay for an extension and expansion of tax cuts.
By state law, the special election to replace Green must occur later this year. A primary election is likely to take place in September, and the general election in late October or early November. 
State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, announced in a statement Monday he will run for the seat. Barrett, who voted against Gov. Bill Lee’s private school voucher program, positioned himself in the statement as an outsider. 
“I’ve taken on the elites in my own party and stood up for you,” Barrett said. “And like President Trump, they came after me to get to you.”

Barrett joins four other Republicans who have announced they are running to replace Green:

Jason Knight, a Montgomery County Commissioner
Matt Van Epps, a former Tennessee General Services Commissioner
State Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin
Jonathan Thorp, a U.S. Army veteran

A sixth Republican, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission on Monday. 
On the Democratic side, Bo Mitchell, a state representative from Nashville, announced his candidacy for the seat.
“Now more than ever, Tennessee needs leaders in Congress who will have the courage to fight for us, not just cave to political pressure,” Mitchell said in a statement. “I am disgusted by the passage of this big, ugly bill; it will decimate rural health care and close rural hospitals.”
Rep. Aftyn Behn, another Nashville Democrat, filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC on Monday. 
Down the line, a race for District 6
Green’s resignation follows U.S. Rep. John Rose, a Cookeville Republican, who announced in March he will make a bid for governor in 2026, opening up the 6th Congressional seat. The 6th district includes the eastern part of Nashville, parts of Wilson County and about a dozen counties in Middle and East Tennessee.

Candidates for the 6th district have more time to declare, as Rose appears likely to finish his term. The 6th district election will fall on the traditional 2026 midterm election dates. 
Van Hilleary, who represented Tennessee Congressional District 4 from 1995 to 2003,  and serves as Rose’s chief of staff, filed his statement of candidacy with the FEC on July 1 to run to replace Rose. Hilleary last ran for office in 2002, when he lost a race for Tennessee governor to Democrat Phil Bredesen.
Other candidates to announce so far are Republican Dale Braden and Democrat Mike Croley.

(Photo by Leigh Vogel/Getty Images)We find ourselves in an environment where The Big Lie has become a phrase applied to voter fraud, the 2020 presidential election and numerous other real and perceived political lies and disinformation. It is ubiquitous in modern American politics. 
As we watched the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (H.R.1) move back and forth between the U.S. House and Senate, another phrase Republican politicians used frequently to justify their support for a bill that is going to cut Medicaid by nearly a trillion dollars over 10 years was waste, fraud and abuse. (Example: “The legislation also achieves significant savings by […] targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,” U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a June 16 news release.)
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Recently, I listened to a representative of the organization Medicare Sisters and Me answer a question posed by an Idaho Medicaid participant about whether she should be concerned about the proposed Medicaid cuts in the budget bill. She responded that unless participants were committing any sort of waste, fraud or abuse, they had nothing to worry about. 
This was someone supposedly educated in the system’s workings. The questioner made clear that she was a Medicaid participant through the expansion of the program for low-income Idahoans. Will the cuts affect low-income Idahoans on Medicaid? There is little doubt, yet the lie we keep being told is that the only cuts to Medicaid will result from reining in waste, fraud and abuse. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) defines waste as ordering more tests than are necessary and then asking for reimbursement. It is also ordering unnecessary medical equipment. Does this happen? Occasionally, but more due to a lack of care coordination or hurried health care providers with ballooning caseloads. 
You know where there is also waste, fraud and abuse? Medicare. And private insurance. We are not robots working under the spell of an algorithm. We are complex human beings with needs, needs that are treated by human doctors who will have different views of treatment. Where one provider might say that a statin is necessary, another might encourage avoiding it for as long as possible. Where one provider might prescribe two medications for an illness another might only prescribe one. It’s the nature of health care.
I am not so idealistic that I deny that Medicaid fraud happens. However, as someone who receives their health care through Medicare and Medicaid, I can confirm that the process of getting Medicaid is complex and thorough. And your Medicaid card isn’t for keeps. Every year you have to go through recertification just as you do for other means-tested programs.
You know who does commit Medicaid fraud? Providers. Nursing home executives. People who make their living off the care for those who rightfully receive Medicaid. 
Medicare and Medicaid fraud are criminal acts. Trying to get reimbursed for services you didn’t actually provide? Fraud. This is already a focus of the CMS. 
Would it surprise you that Trump has demonstrated that he doesn’t actually care about the biggest crimes against these programs? He granted clemency to one such fraudster, Lawrence Duran, a Florida health care executive who was found guilty of a scheme to defraud Medicare to the tune of $205 million. At the very same time Republicans began this charade of supposedly protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud and abuse, Trump quietly commuted Duran’s sentence. Republicans did not condemn Trump’s action.
The Republicans would have you believe that people are gaming the system. That they are improperly receiving benefits (i.e. abuse). 
They clearly haven’t ever had to apply for life-saving benefits like Medicaid, SNAP or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP): having to line up bank statements, determine the worth of your home or vehicle, outline every cost associated with dependents, determine the overall out-of-pocket pharmaceutical costs, calculate all medical costs that fell outside of what Medicaid covered — a never-ending cost for people with disabilities, especially — for a given year. Having to determine annual income including income verification from the Social Security Administration — whose office you can no longer walk into without an appointment — and tally up any money gifted to you by friends or family is a process that does not scream “gaming the system.” 
If anything, it deters people in need from receiving necessary services they deserve because the process is so onerous.
Waste, fraud and abuse rarely come at the hands of recipients. Fraud is a criminal act, but waste and abuse are rarely malicious. When the cuts go into effect, the price will be paid by recipients who most need these programs.
The ongoing anti-immigrant fervor in this country has seeped into Trump’s bill as well with respect to Medicaid and SNAP. As part of this so-called war on waste, fraud and abuse, they seek to eliminate the chance of unauthorized immigrants receiving assistance. What they fail to tell you, again, is how difficult it is for authorized immigrants to apply for and receive Medicaid or SNAP. 
Immigrants in this country legally who are establishing a life here and are getting their feet under them are judged harshly by the immigration system if they so much as apply for assistance programs. They don’t always enter this country with an immediate job or health care and, believe me, plans do fall apart. If a person has the terrible misfortune of becoming ill before attaining the lofty goal of American health care, the system fails them. Many can’t apply for Medicaid or American Care Act (ACA) subsidies, but they also can’t work. 
The cost of their care, should they not be able to pay, ends up falling to the hospitals and clinics that treat them. This will continue to be a cost that hospitals will pass on to patients regardless of what type of insurance they have. This will again become an issue for states and counties as it was before the ACA.  
In the coming years, conveniently the years after the 2026 midterms, when the debt ceiling has been raised by $5 trillion, an additional $3 trillion is added to the national debt, the child poverty rate has increased, up to 11 million Americans are kicked off of Medicaid, more lose ACA subsidies, states lose as much as a quarter of the federal matching funds that they receive to administer their Medicaid programs and rural hospitals, clinics and nursing homes experiencing immense pain from less Medicaid money close their doors, I wonder what the Big Lie will be then.

Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn is running against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms. 
After launching an exploratory committee in April, Osborn made it official Tuesday, choosing the Senate race over potential bids for governor and the U.S. House, because, he said, “there are not enough seats at the table” for working people.
“I’m unapologetically for the workers and their issues,” Osborn told Nebraska Examiner. 
Osborn boiled down his race to “the billionaire versus the mechanic,” citing the wealth of the Ricketts family. 
Ricketts himself appears more likely to be a millionaire, based on his Senate financial disclosure forms. But he is part of a family that built the company that became TD Amertrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. 
Osborn said he would approach legislation “based on principles” and not “on any kind of monetary [gain].” He pointed to Trump’s “big beautiful bill” as a piece of legislation with tax breaks that would make Ricketts richer “off the backs of people” who are at risk of losing benefits from Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
“If I had been elected in 2024, that ‘big beautiful bill’ would not have gotten passed,” Osborn said. 
The GOP mega-bill made the tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners while also introducing some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less. It was a central piece of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. 
To offset the costs of the bill, the law reduces spending on the social safety net by adding work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps. It also lowers provider taxes that nearly every state uses to help fund Medicaid health insurance programs for low-income residents. 
Ricketts and the rest of Nebraska’s federal delegation voted in lockstep for the legislation. Ricketts called the bill a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver for Nebraska.” 
“This legislation will result in increased security, strength and prosperity for the American people,” Ricketts said in a statement. “The bill restores critical pro-growth business provisions and makes them permanent, benefiting Nebraska farming, ranching and small business.” 
The delegation and pro-business and anti-tax lobbying groups, including Americans for Prosperity, are touting the benefits of the bill to Nebraskans, as multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it. 
Ricketts, who served two terms as Nebraska governor before being appointed to the Senate by his successor, faced some pushback from constituents in April about the bill and other issues. He won a special election to hold the Senate seat in November.
This is Osborn’s second Senate bid. His populist run against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024 made national headlines for turning an expected safe race for Republicans into a potential upset. He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul of $14 million for a federal candidate in Nebraska without direct ties to a major party, including some late money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee once they saw his momentum.

He lost by about six percentage points. Fischer, during and after the race, described him as a “Democrat in sheep’s clothing” and said the campaign finance reports confirmed her belief. State voting records show Osborn as a registered nonpartisan since at least 2004, as the Nebraska Examiner reported.
Osborn said he is at a “stronger” starting point now than in 2024 because more people in the state know him. 
“We were learning how to build the plane as we were learning how to fly it last time,” Osborn told the Examiner. “Now it’s built. We know how to fly it.”
Republicans have almost completely dominated America’s heartland, a region once known for its prairie progressivism. If Osborn were able to unseat Ricketts, it would be the first time a non-Republican had represented Nebraska in Congress since Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford upset Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District in 2014. 
Osborn could benefit from a bump in Democratic turnout in the Omaha area after the announced retirement of five-term Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon led the nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball to shift the 2nd District U.S. House race to leaning Democrat from toss-up. 
Ricketts has a significant political war chest and has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics. But populism, whether Osborn’s approach or Trump’s, is the driving force in modern politics, as voters lose faith in institutions and seek alternatives. Some political observers believe the same working-class-focused rhetoric that drove President Donald Trump’s victory could give someone like Osborn an opening. 
Ricketts faced similar populism in 2022, when a leadership team loyal to him leading the Nebraska Republican Party was ousted in favor of a team more loyal to Trump. But the former governor retains the dominant political operation in the state. Some Republicans who crossed him in the Legislature lost seats, and his endorsement holds weight. 
His endorsed candidate for governor, Pillen, defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022, Charles Herbster. Ricketts already has received the endorsement of Trump. The nod came after an internal poll showed Osborn statistically tied with Ricketts, although people familiar with the endorsement process said it had been in the works for weeks and that Trump decided the timing.
Ricketts gets early ads from group tied to Senate GOP in potential Osborn race

Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said, “Senator Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families and seniors. Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors.”
Osborn during the last race did not say whom he would caucus with if elected. His campaign had no immediate response to a similar question Monday.
Osborn had been eyeing multiple potential races before narrowing it down to Ricketts’ seat in April. One of the races he considered, for the state’s 2nd Congressional District, has garnered significant interest from Democratic candidates. Osborn has said he didn’t want to play “spoiler” for that seat.
It’s unclear whether Democrats will run a candidate in the Senate race, but Osborn said it doesn’t matter to him. He said both parties are “going to do what they do.” 
Osborn and his supporters drew criticism in 2024 for trying to minimize the number of names on his Senate race’s general election ballot other than his and Fischer’s. Some Democrats grumbled that he flirted with seeking Democratic support until it was too late for them to run their own candidate, and leaders in the Legal Marijuana Now Party complained that Osborn supporters took over the party’s nominating process to help clear a path for him. 
The Nebraska Democratic Party, in a statement, seemed to hint at support for Osborn’s effort, saying, “Breaking up the one-party stranglehold on our state is going to take an unlikely alliance of Democrats, Republicans and Independents coming together to fix a very broken Washington, D.C.” 
Osborn said he feels like he’s set to win. 
“I want to show the country, and I want to show Nebraska that we could do it differently here,” Osborn said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office will consider joining a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency, he told Newsline in an exclusive interview on Saturday.
Last week, the Trump administration’s Bureau of Land Management invoked the emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of a permit to expand a loading facility near Price, Utah for oil coming out of the nearby Uinta Basin. The expansion could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day.
It’s anticipated that the expansion of what’s known as the Wildcat Loadout facility — located on publicly owned federal lands — and other nearby facilities will allow the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for transport in the Uinta Basin Railway project. Eagle County and state officials have long opposed increased oil trains along the Colorado River.

In a June 27 letter to Jerry Davis, acting Utah state director for the BLM, Weiser wrote that an expedited environmental assessment for the proposed Wildcat right-of-way expansion would be a “violation of applicable laws and regulations” that would block proper public input and “subject Colorado communities to significant economic, environmental, and health and safety risks.”
Weiser argued there is no national energy emergency given the United States produced more oil last year than any nation in history, and he urged the BLM to follow standard, legally required procedures in reviewing the project. An attorney for Eagle County and an environmental group that successfully sued the federal government to delay the rail project, also sent letters.
But late Thursday, the BLM issued its approval, finding “no significant impact” related to the expansion, which Colorado opposes due to increased derailment, wildfire and oil-spill risks, and the agency directly cited its authority under Trump’s January executive order declaring a national energy emergency, allowing for the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects.
On Saturday, before a fundraiser here for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, Weiser said he had not heard about the expedited approval of the Wildcat Loadout or had time to debrief the ruling.
“I am sorry to hear that. I’m not shocked, but it’s a sign of the times we’re in — the lack of stewardship to protect our land, air, and water is appalling,” Weiser said. “We’re going to have to be creative to find every way we can to make sure that these decisions aren’t being made hastily with long-term, harmful consequences.”
In May, 15 states — led by the attorneys general in Washington and California — filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s energy emergency executive order. Calling it a “fake” emergency designed to line the pockets of Big Oil, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown pointed to the order’s exclusion of clean energy projects as it strips away vital environmental protections.
The May lawsuit claims Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency is a violation of the National Emergencies Act itself, which is designed to prevent frivolous or partisan declarations.
“We don’t think it is a real emergency,” Weiser said Saturday. “Up until now, this national energy emergency order hasn’t affected Colorado. But given these dynamics (of the expedited BLM approval), we’re going to be looking at that to make sure that we can do all we can to protect Colorado.”
Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited what they deemed illegal fast-tracking of environmental reviews by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in violation of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other key environmental laws.
“The only ‘emergency’ is that the president disagrees with policies to address climate change in Washington state and elsewhere,” Brown wrote in May. “He is illegally using emergency authorities to keep the nation reliant on energy sources like coal, oil and gas.”
Weiser has previously said he will keep all of his options open in opposing the Uinta Basin oil expansion as it seeks to vastly expand oil-train traffic along the headwaters of the endangered Colorado River, which supplies water to more than 40 million people. The BLM approval in a two-week window now has him questioning Trump’s national energy emergency rules.
“So we didn’t have an ability to make this case [back in May], but we at the time said that we would be looking closely at whether and when it would affect Colorado and we’d be ready to file,” Weiser said Saturday. “And with this, now we have to look at it.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

(Aidan Cornue | West Virginia University)In rural Wyoming County, West Virginia, Ann Reed is the sheriff’s department’s only social worker. 
Funded through a temporary grant from a local mental health center, Reed provides resources and care to individuals who experience substance use disorder on a daily basis. 
She assists the Wyoming County Sheriff’s Department by monitoring a local mental health agency’s 911 calls and checking if any are drug-related. If they are, Reed then responds to individuals at their homes, taking them to treatment facilities — and sometimes, witnessing their arrests. 
“We pick up, we arrest, we send off,” Reed said. 
Usually, the place they send them off to is jail.

Wyoming County is one of the state’s most rural. It’s home to about 20,000 residents, but no hospital and zero certified treatment beds, according to the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy. As the nation’s opioid overdose epidemic raged, Wyoming County had a prescription overdose death rate of 54.6 per 100,000 people from 1999 to 2014 — the highest in the nation. 
The county still battles the lasting effects of the opioid crisis. It has 12 certified female beds and one comprehensive behavioral health care provider to help them do it. But like communities across the country, Wyoming County is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars through opioid lawsuit settlements to spend on law enforcement, prevention education, treatment, recovery and harm reduction services.
West Virginia will receive an estimated $980 billion over the next 17 years from a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic. 
Wyoming is one of at least 9 counties in West Virginia that have used their opioid settlement funds to pay off at least a portion of their regional jail bill, an analysis of Freedom of Information Act requested documents by students from West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media from 50 of the state’s 55 counties shows. In total, those nine counties have spent more than $3.5 million on bills to house West Virginians in its 10 regional jails.
“In small counties, we unfortunately are limited financially,” Grant County Commissioner Kevin Hagerty said in an email. His county spent half of their settlement funds — $115,528 — on their regional jail bill. “The jail bill has been a pretty significant expense for us over several years. We used a portion of the funds to help ease the burden on resources.” 
As part of an investigation into these practices, Reed School of Media journalism students reached out to county commissioners in all nine counties that reported spending opioid settlement funds on jail bills. Representatives from four counties responded, and all said spending the opioid settlement funds in this way aligns with what is allowed in state rules for spending, written by the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. 
But experts say there is a difference between how the funds can legally be spent and the intent behind the global settlement that was the result of hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths across the country. 
A crisis-fueled debt
Jail fees pose a significant burden on counties in West Virginia, where taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for the bill. Documents from the state’s Department of Homeland Security show several counties owe millions of dollars in jail fees. 
As of April 4, 2025, the 55 counties in West Virginia owe a total of $15,020,710.48 on their regional jail bills. Clay, McDowell and Webster counties owe the most — and, according to a source familiar with the state’s jail payment processes, have for the past decade. 
How state, county and city leaders can spend their opioid settlement funds is guided by an MOU that former Attorney General Patrick Morrisey — now governor — helped to establish in 2022. The MOU outlines that funds can be spent in several areas: prevention, treatment, recovery, law enforcement and EMS. 
Under law enforcement, the MOU specifically says funds can be used for evidence-based programs for individuals who are incarcerated or are exiting incarceration, education and training programs for law enforcement personnel, mental health and support resources, equipment, tools and manpower for first-responder agencies. 
The MOU acknowledges regional jail fees as an approved use of opioid lawsuit settlement funding, saying it provides “restitution for monies that were previously expended on opioid abatement activities.”
And several counties have decided putting money toward these overdue bills is a priority. In Wyoming County, Commissioner Jason Mullins said many people in the regional jail are incarcerated for opioid-related offenses, so it’s a logical use for the funds.

Logan County is spending nearly a million of its $3.9 million fund on its jail bill. In Boone County, officials are putting $452,766 of opioid settlement funds toward that use. 
“If a Madison police officer makes an arrest inside city limits, Boone County is still responsible for the jail bill,” Boone County Commissioner Brett Kuhn said. “So that’s a very difficult thing when you’re in the economic condition we find ourselves in today to come up with.” 
Kuhn says Boone County usually owes $60,000-$70,000 per month on their jail bill, and uses the county’s portion of the coal severance tax revenues to pay it off. He says using opioid settlement funds instead of the coal severance tax to pay the jail bill will allow them to redirect severance funds to other economic development opportunities in the county.
“I think one of the most important ways to combat the situation we find ourselves in now is to create good, high-paying jobs,” Kuhn said. 
Several county officials say the decision to pay off their jail bills first stems from a lack of funding to pay down what they owe. Commissioner Kevin Hagerty said the Grant County Commission also has plans to use its funding to assist in opening a nonprofit sober living house.
“Before we commit to funding, there are various things that we must consider, such as liability issues, operational structure, who would oversee different mechanics of the house, etc.,” he said. “We are pretty early in the process; however, it is something that we see as very positive if it were to come to fruition.” 
The commission has already approved the building of a Safe Haven Baby Box with the settlement funds.

Laura Lander, addiction therapist and associate professor at West Virginia University’s School of Medicine, says there are other ways the funds could be spent that would offer long-term support for people affected by substance use. 
Lander, a past opioid settlement grant review panelist for the West Virginia First Foundation, said that things like child advocacy centers, youth prevention and workforce development would be more effective spending. 
Lander said that using the money on “short-sighted” areas like the jail bill are not going to help people who are struggling.
“It’s not going to address the problem, it’s just going to pay a bill,” she said. “I’m sure everybody has regional jail bills, but it’s not actually addressing the problem. It sounds like it’s addressing a shortfall in the county’s budget or planning.” 
Some county officials agree. In Mercer County, Commissioner Greg Puckett says other counties’ use of their settlement funds on the jail bill is understandable — but that doesn’t make it the best use of the money. 
“I think it’s kind of a faulty philosophy,” Puckett said. “There are identified strategies that are a lot more effective in ways to deal with the opioid problems that we’ve seen in the past. Those come from building for future solutions, not looking in reverse.” 
Instead of paying their jail bill — which was $163,000 for the month of May — Puckett said Mercer County wants to use their funds to improve infrastructure, including a new sheriff’s department building and parks for “engagement in positive activities.” 
“When you pay the jail bill, that’s essentially a reverse thinking philosophy of just getting out from under it. You’re never going to be able to get out completely from under it because of the way the costs are,” he said. 
Unlike Wyoming or Boone counties, Mercer County also plans to create a task force to help delegate funds that would include mental health experts and people in long-term recovery. 
Frank Kearl is an attorney with Popular Democracy. He said he has been developing strategies to ensure transparency and accountability in opioid settlement fund spending alongside organizers and community activists in New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Kearl said using the settlement funds to pay for regional jail bills is legal in his read of the West Virginia MOU and his understanding of the rules outlined by the global settlement, but said the legality of using the funds in a certain way and whether that’s the best use for them are different questions. 
“Someone would need to be paying attention to where that money was going to ensure that two years from now, when they want to spend the money on something else that’s not related, there’s someone there to be like, ‘wait a second, you already spent all of this money in this other way, so you don’t have that remaining funds,’” Kearl said. “And that’s just not happening.” 
“That’s not happening in West Virginia. That’s not happening anywhere. No one is paying close enough attention to where this money is going.” 
Plus, Kearl said, this is West Virginia’s only shot — just like it is for every state. These funds will only come once. If they’re misspent from the start, government leaders cannot go back to the corporations that are part of the global settlement and sue for more.
And in the current MOU and settlement structure, there is no federal oversight. State, local and city governments have full control of the processes. 
“The way that the settlements are set up prevents any subsequent liability for these corporations and individuals for the harm that they caused. So someone living in West Virginia, in one of these counties where this money is being spent on something that’s completely unrelated, they don’t have another bite at the apple,” Kearl said. 
“This is their one opportunity to see meaningful justice served resolution,” he said. “Money spent in a way that is helping resolve the harms that they have suffered and continue to suffer, and so when that money is wasted, to me, it’s less even about the legality or illegality and more about the justice of it.” 
What experts, communities say they actually need
Despite the MOU allowing the payment of regional jail fees, some activists say they’d like to see the money used in other ways.
Brittney Garrett is a representative of Police Assisted Addiction & Recovery Initiative, a national nonprofit organization that encourages people struggling with substance use disorder to go to a local police station to receive drug screenings and other recovery services without being arrested. Garrett helps individuals find pathways to treatment and provides guidance for law enforcement when they interact with people struggling with substance use disorder. 
Garrett said allocating funding to law enforcement can be an effective measure, as long as the money is spent on programs specifically designed to benefit the community in accessing treatment and recovery services.
“We really need to make sure that it’s opioid-specific and that we are helping individuals who are struggling with substance use and connecting them to treatment and recovery to not continue this,” she said. 
She encouraged county commissions to use other funding pools for treatment and recovery services. 
Reporting in West Virginia shows some counties are spending their funds on a shooting range in Jackson County or a UTV for the police department in Ohio County. 
“I think that there is other funding for things like shooting ranges or police vehicles,” Garrett said in response to the reporting. 
Lander also said the counties need to look at long-term treatment solutions. She said purchasing new vehicles or new buildings is not sustainable, and if counties want to support infrastructure, the settlement money should go towards recovery housing. 
“We have an affordable housing crisis in this state, that is, in my opinion, directly connected to the substance use disorder problem. And one of the reasons why it’s so difficult for people to get well is that they don’t have stable housing,” Lander said. “It’s very hard to be in recovery and not have a stable place to live.”
Kearl said county leaders need more guidance to ensure funds are distributed to areas outside of law enforcement or jail bills. 
“Dropping $3 million in a county-level account and expecting them to use it in a way to resolve harms from a crisis that they didn’t create in the first place and that they were not actively participating in the settlement process at all is irresponsible by the state,” he said.
One county’s lingering struggle
In Wyoming County, Sheriff Bradley Ellison — who social worker Ann Reed works with directly — said there is a lack of resources for residents who have been affected by the opioid crisis and for emergency personnel like him who have responded to opioid-related emergencies for nearly two decades.  
Ellison has worked at the county’s sheriff’s department for more than 30 years, responding to the opioid crisis on the front lines. His department consists of 18 officers, and Ellison said it’s understaffed and underfunded. And while he said he wasn’t sure what the Wyoming County Commission should spend its funding on, he said he needs things that will help his department continue to do their jobs, like new cruisers and an increase in personnel.

Ellison believes the county is unlikely to continue funding recovery, prevention, or treatment services once settlement funding runs out. He also said he was not against the use of opioid settlement funds to pay their jail bill. 
“Like if you wanted a facility and it cost a million dollars, you’re blowing through your money. Are you helping anything? Because once this money’s gone, the county ain’t gonna pick it up and take it out of their coffers because it ain’t there,” Ellison said. “You got to try to hit the best way to make the biggest impact that you can with what you got.” 
Despite current efforts to combat substance use disorders in the county, he said financial support came long after Wyoming County residents were experiencing the worst of the opioid crisis. 
“They was 10 years too late on the opioid problem. We was crying and screaming in the early 2000s, ‘Help. Gosh, help.’ Nobody would listen,” Ellison said. “Nobody would listen.”
Ellison said he’s worried that they’re still too late to help the people who need it most.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Vanderbilt University Medical Center laid off the staff of its LGBTQ Health Program in late June, effectively shuttering a resource that helped LGBTQ+ people access and navigate healthcare for the last decade.
Members of the institution’s LGBTQ Health Community Advisory Board and a former member of the program’s office staff say VUMC quietly eliminated the office and its Trans Buddy program on June 24 with no notice to the community or the patients served by the program’s resources.
Instead, the Community Advisory Board learned of the layoffs from affected employees and shared the information along with an open letter to VUMC administrators on social media. 
The layoffs did not impact medical staff at VUMC’s Vivid Health Clinic, which continues to offer medical care, according to Community Advisory Board Chair Ray Holloman and Dahron Johnson, the board’s immediate past chair.
Spokespeople for VUMC did not respond to multiple requests for comment or detailed questions about the staff terminations. VUMC previously issued a statement on June 30 confirming that it expects to lay off 650 research, administrative and support employees due to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration.

The news spurred the Metro Council of Nashville’s LGBTQ Caucus to publish a letter to the health organization on July 1, expressing its “deep disappointment” in VUMC’s “pattern of decisions — both actions and inactions — that have left a once-loyal community feeling misled, abandoned, and deeply betrayed.”
Caucus members cited VUMC’s 2022 pause of gender-affirming surgeries for minors, 2023 release of transgender patients’ medical records to the Tennessee Attorney General, April 2025 elimination of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs and the institution’s withdrawal of medical support from the 2025 Nashville Pride Festival as reasons for the caucus’ statement of no confidence in VUMC leadership.
“This is not about red tape or resources. This is about values. Each of these moments was a chance to show conviction. Instead, you revealed where your priorities lie,” the caucus letter states. “You failed us. You stood on our backs as we lifted you up. You benefitted from our trust, our pride, and our presence. And when we needed you most, you betrayed us. We will not forget.”
Johnson, a transgender woman who graduated from Vanderbilt Divinity School in 2008 and has gone on to become a chaplain and serve on multiple community boards, described the LGBTQ Health Program’s abrupt closure as a betrayal of VUMC’s clinical promises to put patients’ needs first.
“There is no hiding the fact that (the LGBTQ+ community) have been targeted in the ways we’ve been targeted,” Johnson said. “When you offer care, we as patients, as a community, are looking for you to stand by the thing that you have willingly, openly committed yourself to. This type of last-second, in-the-middle-of-the-night closure is just absolutely reprehensible and an utter dereliction of the basics of care, whether that’s (for) trans folks or any other type of person.”

Trans Buddy program axed
Quinn Bacon was preparing to train her replacement as coordinator for VUMC’s Trans Buddy program when she was told the position was eliminated, effective June 30 – the last day of Pride Month. 
Bacon, a transgender woman, started in the role in January 2023, ensuring that the program’s phone line was staffed 12 hours each day to answer questions about resources, community, safety, and more. People could also call the line to request a “Trans Buddy” — one of the volunteers trained by Bacon — to accompany them to any appointment at any VUMC location for support.
“There were times that patients were put in unsafe situations or were experiencing medical neglect, and by having a Trans Buddy there to provide community support while also advocating for them to be treated fairly in the hospital, we were able to help people get what they needed and feel humanized at the same time,” Bacon said.
She planned to leave in August upon completing graduate school. Bacon, her boss and her predecessors believed the role was a part-time federal work study position, she said. While she could not continue work study, she planned to keep volunteering with the program.
During a call with VUMC Human Resources staff in late June, Bacon found out she’d lost her job, and she wouldn’t be offered any severance because the role was classified as temporary, she said. (VUMC’s June 30 statement said it would provide severance and other assistance to affected employees). 










It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight.


– Don't forget to add author


The HR team was at first unaware that she still worked at VUMC, and didn’t know she was still a student, despite her work badge identifying her as a student worker, she said.
They also told her the position was not, in fact, paid through work study. Bacon said she thought of the opportunities she’d passed on in order to stay eligible for the coordinator position — a fellowship she turned down when she found out it was funded through federal work study, and her library job she had to quit “because I was told that the Trans Buddy program maxes out my hours.”
VUMC representatives did not respond to questions about Bacon’s termination.
The end of the Trans Buddy program is also personal for Johnson, who called the program’s number in early 2020 after having her own “now or never” moment, Johnson said. The person she spoke with helped her connect with clinical providers and informed her on routes to set up a visit. That person was one of the people who lost their job in June, Johnson said. 
A call to the Trans Buddy phone number Monday rang through to an error message after multiple rings.
Johnson said the LGBTQ Health Program office and the Trans Buddy program also served as a sort of clearinghouse for LGBTQ resources at VUMC, an entry point and navigator for patients seeking care and a source of education for hospital services and providers.
Holloman said the office staff provided awareness training to “ensure that if trans or queer people are interacting with these staff, they don’t get misgendered, they’re looking at their records, they push to get gender identity and sexual orientation and legal sex and all of these things into the health record so that people would feel comfortable coming there.”
Bacon said patients planning to go to VUMC now “should plan to bring people with them that they want to protect them. They should not expect that the hospital will provide people that will do that sort of advocacy work.”
Community Advisory Board Chair says VUMC actions have eroded trust
The Trans Buddy program and gender-affirming care were part of the Tennessee Office of the Attorney General’s demand for documents in 2023 for what it said was an investigation into possible violations of the Tennessee Medicaid False Claims Act. 
The demand included volunteer resumes, emails sent by members of the general public to an LGBTQ+ health questions portal and communications with outside therapists, in addition to the names of people who were referred to Vanderbilt for transgender care but opted not to pursue it. Any medical records reviewed under investigations into billing are kept confidential, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s office stated in 2023.
A VUMC spokesperson at the time stated the institution did not comply with every demand for records, without elaboration.
Patients sue Vanderbilt for releasing transgender clinic records to Tennessee AG

Several patients sued VUMC in Davidson County Chancery Court following the disclosure of their medical records. The case went into mediation on May 30 and was settled as of June 11, according to court records that do not specify the terms of the settlement.
A representative for Skrmetti’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the result of the office’s investigation into VUMC’s billing practices for gender-related treatment.
Holloman, a transgender man who has received care through the Vivid Clinic, said administrative decisions have eroded trust in VUMC in recent years. The Community Advisory Board for the LGBTQ Health Program anticipated the program would be dismantled given “the way Vanderbilt has been trending over the last few years.”
“It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight,’” Holloman said.
If Holloman had a “magic wand,” rebuilding trust in the community would start with bringing back the terminated positions and the employees who filled them, but it would be a “long road,” he said.
“Trans buddy and all of the other programs that they had made it so people could access healthcare,” Holloman said. “They are a healthcare organization … with the moves that they’ve just made, they are discouraging people now from accessing health care until it becomes an emergency.”

ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel. Applicants don’t need a background in government, law or ethics.
“Civic leaders, farmers, ranchers, local business owners, health care professionals, parents, educators, legal professionals, problem solvers and community advocates can make a positive impact on our state by serving on the Ethics Commission,” the board said in a Monday news release announcing the vacancies.
Some people are barred under state law from serving on the Ethics Commission. These include:

elected or appointed state officials, lobbyists and political party officials
candidates for statewide office
legislative employees

Those interested in serving on the commission can learn more on the governor’s office’s website. The deadline to apply is Aug. 8.
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

Commissioners are appointed by a consensus vote of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also expires Aug. 31, though he is seeking reappointment. Sagsveen joined the commission last year following former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard’s retirement. 
The Ethics Commission asked the governor’s office, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Kathy Hogan to approve Sagsveen’s reappointment. 
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Land-use boards aren’t representative of the communities they serve, report finds",Janhavi Munde and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/land-use-boards-demographic-representation/,"A survey in New London and Fairfield Counties found that land-use boards were mostly comprised of white, male homeowners.","Local land-use boards, which make zoning decisions about where housing, businesses and industrial spaces get built in each Connecticut town, are disproportionately composed of older, white male homeowners — and not demographically representative of the communities they serve, a study of New London and Fairfield Counties found. 
In a new report the Housing Collective, a housing reform nonprofit, examined 105 land-use boards across the two southern Connecticut counties. In both counties, just under half of the general population is male, but 70% of planning and zoning board members are men. 
Nearly 60% of Fairfield County is white, but white individuals make up over 90% of land-use board members there. In New London county, over 70% of the county’s population is white, but white people make up nearly 100% of land-use board members. 
Most board members are also older. The median age of board members in the two counties was between 60 and 65, while the overall median age was 20 years younger than that. While only about 70% of residents, across both counties, owned their homes, the study found more than 90% of board members were homeowners.
“It’s the thing that we all know in our hearts,” said Melissa Kaplan-Macey, chief initiative officer of Centers for Housing Opportunities, which is part of the collective. “But then when you do the research and you look at the data, it’s still shocking at the same time.”
Advocates for denser housing development and zoning reform say this disproportionate representation could affect the way land-use decisions are made.
“If you had local land-use boards that were representative of the communities that they serve,”  said Kaplan-Macey, land-use boards would then be “responding to the full needs of a local community — not just a small subset.”
But others say representation that doesn’t exactly align with the demographics of a community isn’t necessarily a problem — as long as the work is done responsibly. 
Land-use boards are required to follow local laws and town ordinances, said Betsy Gara, Executive Director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. So overrepresentation of any one demographic, “shouldn’t make a big difference,” she said. 
Still, Gara added, “I think it would certainly be valuable to have more diversity on local boards and commissions,” though she noted it can be difficult to fill board seats, especially in small towns. Many municipalities make efforts to recruit people to participate in local government, she said. 
Filling seats
Volunteer led and locally rooted, land-use boards help form what communities look like, how much green space they have, and even how much space there is between the front of a home and the road. 
Filling seats on these boards is not so simple. There are two primary ways the seats get filled. Depending on a town’s bylaws, board members are either elected or appointed. Both options present challenges. 
Nick Kantor, program director at Desegregate CT and a board member on Norwalk’s Planning & Zoning Commission, said there tends to be a bias against new housing development among voters who show up for municipal elections.  
Nationally, voter turnout for renters has lagged behind homeowners for congressional elections in recent years. More broadly, renters are significantly underrepresented in government offices across the United States. 
“That’s pretty well documented,” Kantor said. “And that could be challenging for folks to break through.”
Appointments, while technically easier than elections, still require a level of community engagement and awareness from participants. This means municipalities and towns have to do more outreach to draw broader interest in open positions on land-use boards.
Once a candidate is elected or appointed, they must undergo a state-mandated four hours of training within their first year. 
Once seated on a land-use board, the job — which is unpaid — can be a significant commitment, Kaplan-Macey said. That can make it harder for people who have kids, more than one job, or those who attend night school to join the boards. 
Kaplan-Macey said she’d like to see land-use board members be paid for their work. “I think it would be a whole different scenario, honestly, if we had stipends available that could cover child care or cost of transportation or [the] cost of people’s time,” she said. “If it was actually treated as a second job, I think we’d have a much larger pool of applicants.”
Kantor said while there are excellent examples of younger people on planning and zoning boards who are excited to serve, it’s also true that younger people tend to rent or move around, and aren’t as likely to put down roots, which could explain the underrepresentation of young people on land-use boards. 
It’s also no easy job serving on one of these boards, said Joseph DeLong, director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. Members must deal with complaints and grievances often, he said. 
“Many of these planning and zoning boards, at times become villainized for what hasn’t happened without being recognized for some of the incredible work that they have done,” he said. 
All of these factors can result in certain segments of the population more frequently serving on land-use boards, he said. “What you often end up with are people who are at a stage in life where they don’t have as many responsibilities,” DeLong said. 
“But it also can lead to some boards and commissions that are very heavily weighted by people who are no longer in the workforce, [or] that are no longer raising their children, or are no longer facing some of the economic challenges that maybe the majority within the community are.” 
‘A real opportunity’
DeLong said that disproportionate representation isn’t only prevalent in land-use boards — it persists broadly across local government structures. 
“So I think it’s a very important, very real issue,” DeLong said. “And I say that as an old white man.”
In 2021, CCM started a two-day program in partnership with Yale University called Representation Matters, which trains people of color to run for government and community leadership offices, including land-use board seats. 
The Center for Land Use and Education (CLEAR) at the University of Connecticut, which offers training for land-use board members, has long operated Land Use Academy, a training program that works with students in emerging demographics who are interested in land-use training. 
Renata Bertotti, assistant land use planning educator at CLEAR, said she’s heard from students that making weekly meetings more flexible for board members could broaden access and incentivize involvement of younger demographics. 
“That may be that switch that ends up happening at some point, because we are seeing some younger bodies in our training as well,” Bertotti said. 
DeLong agreed. “We have to recognize that we are living in a new world, post-COVID.” DeLong said, adding that local ordinances and statutes can more easily be adjusted for remote and hybrid meetings now. “Frankly, you probably get stronger participation from the commissioners if you create that flexibility. But more importantly, you get stronger engagement and viewing from the general public as well.”
That type of community engagement is also key, advocates say, to widening participation. 
The Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments, or RiverCOG, recently received a state grant to train board members in public engagement and to build more comprehensive approaches to land-use planning among members.
“We ended up surveying our members of the regional housing committee to ask them what they needed help most with,” said Megan Jouflas, Deputy Director of RiverCOG. “And the number one response was public engagement.”
RiverCOG is working with interns to improve their social media presence as a form of broadened outreach.
The Housing Collective’s report also recommended communities practice broader public engagement and outreach. 
In its study, the Housing Collective reported that an average 10% of board members across both counties are serving on expired terms, with an additional average of 10% vacant seats in New London and Fairfield Counties. 
Kaplan-Macey said she sees that as an opportunity. “So then you have a full 20%. There’s a real opportunity there of addressing that imbalance in terms of representation,” said Kaplan-Macey.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550

Here’s how it happened,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/08/mississippis-court-online-electronic-records/,"The achievement means that attorneys can electronically file legal briefs in every state court, and the public can view court documents through the Mississippi Electronic Court system by subscribing to the system and paying a 20-cents per-page viewing fee.","Every circuit, chancery and county court across Mississippi’s 82 counties is finally part of the statewide electronic court system, completing a nearly two-decade-long mission to have a uniform digital court system. 
Nathan Evans, the director of the Mississippi Electronic Courts, said in a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts, that the successful statewide implementation of the system marks a historic milestone for the judiciary. 
“With both appellate courts and all 188 Chancery, Circuit and County Courts now operating on a single, centralized case management and e-filing system, we have taken a significant leap in efficiency, transparency, and access to justice for the public we serve,” Evans said. 
Electronic court implementation was voluntary in trial courts until the Legislature passed HB 25 in 2020, which Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law, requiring local trial courts to be fully integrated with the electronic system by July 2, 2021. 
But court leaders at the time notified state officials that it would be impossible to meet the statutory deadline and asked the Legislature to appropriate more money for the court to integrate all trial courts into the electronic system more quickly. 
The Legislature did not provide more money for court officials to complete the job of training local chancery and circuit clerk employees in every corner of the state on how to use the system, but court officials proceeded with the Herculean task. 
Still, the achievement means that attorneys can electronically file legal briefs in every state court, and the public can view court documents through the Mississippi Electronic Court system by subscribing to the system and paying a 20-cents per-page viewing fee. 
If citizens still want to view court documents without paying the MEC viewing fee, they can go to the proper courthouse and look at the legal filings on the public court terminal. 
“Now, our judges, district attorneys, public defenders, and attorneys can access and file documents instantly,” Rankin County Circuit Clerk Michelle Adcock said in the news release. “It’s a game changer for courtroom efficiency and transparency. This just streamlines justice and increases public access to court records.”
But before the court’s recent announcement, it took a performance storm almost 20 years ago that involved a whiteboard in Canton, the U.S. Senate’s seniority system and a gift from the federal court for Mississippi’s electronic court system to get off the ground.  
When then-Supreme Court Justice Bill Waller Jr. read an article in a newspaper around 2005 saying that Hinds County would start allowing attorneys to partially “e-file” court documents, he knew the state’ Supreme Court’s high court should get involved.
Waller, an associate justice of the court at the time, realized that if the state’s highest court didn’t step in and provide some guidance on an electronic system, then the state could eventually have a patchwork of different programs. So, he encouraged Chief Justice James Smith to create a task force exploring electronic courts. 
Justice Smith followed Waller’s advice and formed a committee of judges, court clerks and attorneys. Soon, the task force began meeting and listened to a presentation from J.T. Noblin, the clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. 
Noblin walked the task force members through how attorneys and judges used the federal electronic filing system that was in place across federal district courts in the country. After the presentation, Arthur Johnston, the Madison County chancery clerk who served on the committee, had an epiphany. 
“A light went on in my head that said we have so many lawyers in the state who are familiar with that federal system,” Johnston said. “I wondered if that could be the system that we adopt. Justice Waller thought that was a splendid idea.” 
Members of the task force traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, Mississippi’s senior senator, who served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, to discuss the federal electronic court system. 
Cochran used his position as chairman of the committee to slip a provision into the federal judiciary’s appropriation bill that required the federal courts to give the Mississippi court system its federal electronic software and code for free, saving state taxpayers a large sum of money.
After the legislation passed, the wonky and technical work of actually creating a Mississippi version of the federal system began. 
Madison County Chancery Court was the first to attempt to roll out an electronic court, but there was one main snag in trying to copy the federal judiciary’s electronic system: the Chancery Court system dealt with different types of cases than federal court. 
Federal courts typically deal with criminal and civil cases, similar to Mississippi’s Circuit Court system. But the Chancery Court deals with estates, adoption, custody, divorce and questions about the Mississippi Constitution. 
To iron out the issues, Johnston and his deputy clerks — Kim Seivers, Lakisha Jones-Clay and Stacey Toten — worked out of a room in the local WIN Job Center and converted it into a “war room.” 
Each afternoon, the employees would look through Chancery Court cases and create a corresponding description in the database to create its electronic system. The work eventually paid off because Madison County accepted the first electronic case in 2008. 
“We would make notes on a dry-erase board on the problems we ran into,” Johnston said.
The work in the war room eventually created a template that other courts across the state, with the help of the Administrative Office of the Courts, would replicate. 
While the work took decades to complete, Waller hopes that ultimately the openness that comes with an electronic court can improve the public’s image of the judiciary, and make attorneys’ jobs easier. 
“It’s a beautiful success story for the state,” Waller said. “There’s no doubt about it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081932/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘They’ll get over it,’ McConnell reportedly assures GOP colleagues about Medicaid cuts

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Kentucky, Arizona and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs in the state as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
Kentucky Republicans in Congress hail passage of bill the state’s hospitals call ‘devastating’

In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

That was the cap to this past holiday weekend in central North Carolina. An early season tropical storm/depression that seemed initially like no particular big deal suddenly exploded to dump as much as 10 inches of rain in some areas, causing the Eno River to experience a record rise of more than 22 feet in four hours – a rise that beat even the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Fran in 1996 – and massive damage ensued.
Dozens of people had to be rescued, and scores of homes and businesses were damaged. Many major roads and highways were closed, damaged or both. At least one person died.
And, of course, the disastrous flooding here was just small potatoes compared to the horror that occurred in the Texas hill country just days before. At last count, the death toll there from a spate of summer thunderstorms had already surpassed 100, with many people still missing.
Meanwhile, this year’s Atlantic hurricane season has only just begun and, as the people of western North Carolina who saw their region devastated last fall by Hurricane Helene are painfully aware, won’t ramp up to full song until mid-August through late September.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s season promises to be another active one, with a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), 6-10 hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).
So, what gives? Tropical weather and flooding rains have always been fact of life in the eastern half of the United States. Are we just having a run of bad luck?
Unfortunately, the answer to the latter question is almost assuredly a loud and clear “no.”
While it’s true that there’s nothing new about bad weather, as scientists have been telling us for decades, the frequency and severity of modern storms is being greatly worsened by climate change.
As reporter Raymond Zhong of the New York Times reported on July 5:

        “Colossal bursts of rain like the ones that caused the deadly flooding in Texas are becoming more frequent and intense around the globe as the burning of fossil fuels heats the planet, scientists say.
Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, and as temperatures rise, storms can produce bigger downpours. When met on the ground with outdated infrastructure or inadequate warning systems, the results can be catastrophic.”    
At the same time, quite perversely, climate-change-driven drought and desertification continue to spread in other parts of the planet. The situation is especially acute in parts of Africa where they are contributing to widespread hunger and mass migration.
And tragically, these are situations that are only going to get worse and soon – especially if the planet’s rapidly growing human population continues to do little-to-nothing to curb its fossil fuel addiction, while simultaneously developing more and more open land with housing and other infrastructure in which speed and short-term profits trump sustainability.
In other words, this past weekend’s weather in our state was yet another wake-up call to the terrifying fact that we are in the midst of a global emergency that cries out for an urgent, all-hands-on-deck response from government, private industry, academia, and average people. While complete healing of the planet would take centuries, we can still minimize the damage in the decades to come by acting with speed, determination, urgency and creativity.
Quite amazingly and inexcusably, however, this is not the path our leaders are following. To the contrary, the Trump administration – abetted by Republicans in Congress and state legislatures like North Carolina’s – are doing the precise opposite of what is so urgently necessary.
As AP reported, the massive mega-bill signed into law by Trump last Friday “supports mining, drilling and production of the oil, coal and gas that are largely driving Earth’s warming and the increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather that comes with it,” while at the same time slashing “tax credits for clean technologies including wind and solar energy.”
Meanwhile, the bill’s answer to the migration crisis – a phenomenon fueled in part by climate change – is to ramp up the creation of a “show us your papers” police state that conjures up some of the worst imagery from authoritarian regimes Americans once considered the enemies of freedom.
And here in North Carolina, it’s expected that Republican legislative leaders will seek later this month to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a bill that would roll back the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and spur the construction of more fossil fuel-fired power plants.
All in all, it’s a remarkable and maddening state of affairs. At a time of urgent environmental and human crises, our elected leaders have adopted a policy of not just fiddling while Rome burns and floods, but of conducting an entire symphony orchestra of delusional actions designed to expedite and worsen the destruction.
And the need for all Americans to rise up and demand an immediate reversal of this disastrous malfeasance could not be more urgent.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-flooding-Getty2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 05:59:15.738250

(Screenshot by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Disclosure pop-ups about the “cookies,” or other aggregate bits of data websites collect and store aren’t an uncommon experience while shopping online. What’s less common: when a pop-up indicates that your potential purchase of condoms, birth control medication or menstrual hygiene products is being noted digitally, a message Virginians have started seeing when they shop virtually for such products. 
Since July 1, a new state law outlines that people’s personally identifiable reproductive or sexual health information cannot be obtained, disclosed, disseminated or sold without consumer consent. As new laws took effect in Virginia on July 1, Walmart has begun alerting customers about certain product or service searches and purchases.
“By viewing, searching for, or buying these products or services on our site, or using related features such as the Baby Registry, you consent to our use of this information to complete your purchase, provide the requested feature, and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention,” a pop-up disclaimer now notifies people who visit Walmart’s website from within Virginia. 
If consumers don’t want their data connected to their sexual or reproductive health to be stored, the disclaimer suggests they “avoid viewing, searching for, using or purchasing these products, services, or features.”
But not all pop-ups are new or specifically focused on reproductive-related information. Other retailers like CVS have more broad disclaimers about data collection. Its site explains that information collected about consumer behaviors is used “to provide our products and services recommendations, understand how you engage with our site, and improve the services we offer you.”
It also warns that it may share data with “trusted third parties” that include marketing, analytics and research “partners.” 
This sort of data collection is a common practice in e-commerce and is a catalyst for targeted advertisements that people experience elsewhere on the internet, like their social media feeds or when using search engines. 
As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data. 
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, have introduced and supported legislation to shore up these protections.
Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.  
“I don’t think a lot of people realize the information that private industry buys and sells about them,” he said in a recent call. 
He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector. 
“I was concerned that attorneys generals in some other states who want to be more aggressive about prosecuting women or other people for helping women cross state lines to obtain either contraception or abortion services might use information that the private sector has in order to reverse engineer women and other people to prosecute,” Surovell said. 
Surrovell and Favola also worked on bills to prevent menstrual data from being subject to search warrants, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law.  Last year, Youngkin was lambasted by many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert, for opposing the same bill in a previous legislative session. 
“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola said earlier this year. 
As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.  
This year Favola’s Senate Bill 754 passed the Democrat-controlled legislature and Youngkin signed it. The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent. 
Walmart’s interpretation of the law prompted the pop-up disclaimer, and other companies will find their own way to follow suit.
“The companies are trying to figure out how to implement the bill,” Favola said in a text message. 
Next, Favola wants to explore how to further refine the bill to ensure people’s identifiable information is protected. 
“I made it clear that the law is focused on individually-identifiable data — not aggregate data,” she explained. “I expect to make some revisions next session.” 
Further details will be discussed in a workgroup later this summer, she said.

Heat-addled brains might explain the thinking of many Virginia lawmakers that what we need to do right now is burn more fossil fuels. 
Scientists have documented the way high temperatures affect the brain, impairing cognition and causing impulsivity and trouble concentrating. And this summer is already starting out hot, which is saying something given that 2024 was the hottest year on record, bumping 2023 off its baking pedestal. Scientists say this global fever is the natural result of burning fossil fuels and driving CO2 levels to their highest in millions of years.
Since burning more fossil fuels will drive more global warming, it’s exactly the reverse of what we should be doing.  Yes, but, these state leaders respond, how else are we going to power ever more data centers? 
Northern Virginia is the data center capital of the world, and data centers are notoriously power-hungry. Without them, Virginia electricity demand would be flat, and we could easily meet our electricity needs while gradually decarbonizing along the pathway laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
Energy demands, regulations and federal funding challenge Virginia Clean Economy Act

Instead, Virginia taxpayers subsidize some of the richest corporations in America to the tune of almost a billion dollars every year to entice them to rip up land in Loudoun, Prince William and other Virginia counties instead of Atlanta or Dallas. In return, the tech companies keep construction workers busy, underwrite their host counties’ finances, make life miserable for nearby residents, raise everyone’s power bills, drain our rivers and aquifers and pollute our air with enough diesel generators to light up a major city.  
Virginia legislators obviously consider this a fair deal, because that’s what they keep voting for. Whether their constituents agree is another question; the evidence says they don’t.
For anyone just getting up to speed on data center issues, the Virginia Sierra Club’s new report, “Unconstrained Demand: Virginia’s Data Center Expansion and Its Impacts” (to which I contributed), covers the current state of data center development in Virginia and the problems that come with it. Fun fact: More than half of all the nation’s energy consumption attributed to data centers occurs in Virginia. 
That puts a special burden of leadership on our lawmakers. If we allow data centers to undermine our sustainability efforts here, we can only expect a race to the bottom in other states. As Virginia goes, so goes the nation. 
And yet we haven’t heard much outcry from Virginia leaders against the plans of our largest utility to build new generating plants powered by fracked gas. Dominion Energy laid out its plans in its 2024 integrated resource plan as well as a proposal for a 944 megawatts of gas combustion turbines in Chesterfield now pending before the State Corporation Commission. 
Dominion and its allies say more gas is needed for reliability, which could make it allowable under the VCEA. Indeed, “reliability” is a word that fossil fuel advocates frequently toss down like a trump card (in the unpresidential sense but with the same lack of thoughtful analysis). The claim is suspect. Fussing about reliability when your state ranks 24th in the nation for renewable energy is like worrying about the taxes you’ll owe if you win the lottery: we should be so lucky. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republican legislators are explicit in wanting to see the VCEA repealed and more gas plants built. Democrats defend the VCEA’s goals, but worry about the challenges of implementation and the effect on electricity rates. They all cite data center demand as the reason they contemplate backsliding on clean energy.
I wish I could say that our rich and powerful tech companies were aggressively championing carbon-free energy for their data centers in Virginia, but they are not. I attended a meeting of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation where legislators were hashing out the problems of too much demand and too little supply. Representatives from the Data Center Coalition stood in the back of the room, observing but refusing to engage. Out of sight, they successfully lobbied against any bills that would slow the data center boom, force them to absorb more of its costs, or require them to source their own clean energy. 
Publicly, many tech companies tout their commitments to decarbonization. Amazon says it even met its goal to run its operations entirely on renewable energy. Yes, and I’m the Queen of Sheba. In fact, these companies are in a fierce competition to develop artificial intelligence as fast as possible. They’d like carbon-free power, but really, they’ll take whatever energy they can get wherever they can get it, and even among the industry’s best actors, climate now takes a back seat. 
Yet the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos would not be significantly worse off if forced to meet their climate commitments. Virginia leaders know – or at any rate, they have been exposed to the information, which I realize is not the same thing – that building new fossil gas generating plants is not just bad for the planet but more expensive than pursuing carbon-free alternatives.
Renewables face setback under sweeping federal spending bill

Oh, I know, Congress just yanked back the federal tax incentives that helped make wind and solar as cheap as it is, one of the myriad ill-considered elements of the big beautiful debt bomb Republicans adopted against everyone’s better judgment. (Apparently heat affects spines as well as brains.) With passage of that bill, developers will need to have begun construction on new facilities by this time next year in order to qualify for the existing tax credits. 
There will be a mad rush to get construction underway immediately for facilities in the development pipeline. Thereafter, projects on the margin won’t get built. But others will, because even the loss of federal subsidies won’t destroy solar’s competitive edge against most new-build gas. 
Even so, utilities and their customers will pay higher prices for unsubsidized new renewable energy – as well as for existing fossil fuel generation that will command higher prices in the coming supply crunch. The Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates that commercial electricity costs in Virginia will be about 10% higher after the phase-out of federal incentives. 
A years-long backlog for orders of gas turbines will further squeeze energy supply and drive up prices for fossil power. On the plus side, the lack of available turbines will make fast-to-deploy solar not just the better option, but sometimes the only option.
I’ve never understood the conservative love affair with fossil fuels, when today’s clean technology is cleaner, cheaper and quicker to deploy. Trump would like to crush wind and solar altogether, which would eliminate 90% of the power capacity waiting to be connected to the grid and catapult the U.S into a serious energy crisis. In addition to much higher power prices, observers warn we would likely see a loss of data centers and other energy-intensive industries to parts of the world that are not on a mission to kill low-cost clean energy. 
Well, that would be one way to rid Virginia of the data center scourge.
Fortunately, the worst attacks on solar in Trump’s budget bomb did not survive, but the bill should nonetheless serve as a wake-up call for Virginia leaders. With little time left to secure federal clean energy incentives, our utilities need to acquire all the solar and storage they can right now. With or without data centers, locking in as much fuel-free generation as possible while it’s available at a discount is a prudent move to avoid the coming shortages and escalating costs of energy.
As for the tech companies, lawmakers should embrace the simplest approach to this problem, which happens also to be the one that spares ordinary Virginians from bearing the costs of the data center buildout: shifting responsibility for sourcing electricity onto the companies themselves, and requiring that they live up to their climate claims by making the power they buy carbon-free. 
It’s an approach other states can follow, holding Big Tech to the same responsibility no matter where they put their data centers. Certainly the tech titans can afford it; they just won big with massive tax cuts that our poorest residents will pay for. 
No doubt they will complain. Everyone would like somebody else to pay for what benefits them. But Virginians can’t afford to subsidize Big Tech, and we don’t want to. 
As for those legislators who think we should continue to do it anyway – well, all I can think is, it’s got to be the heat.

The Richmond resident has been to Amsterdam, Paris and Berlin — places widely considered some of the most bicycle friendly cities in the world.
“Every time I travel somewhere, I try to check out the transit and the biking if I can,” he said.
When PeopleForBikes’ national report highlighting the best places to bike debuted in late June, Virginia cities ranked low on the list. The news comes after the state has beefed up bike infrastructure to improve access and safety for cyclists. According to a bicycle inventory map released in April, the Commonwealth boasts roughly 1,600 miles of shared-use paths, which include 967 miles of bicycle lanes — many of them buffered. 
Richmond is ranked 37th in the state, just below the cities of Norfolk (35th) and well below Arlington, which came in third in the state. All three are considered midsize cities. The rankings consider if bike infrastructure is close to where people live, if they can bike to jobs, schools, grocery and retail stories, and if they can access public transportation.
Virginia Safe Routes to School programs see future funding in jeopardy

“This is a data driven process,” said Grace Stonecipher, infrastructure analytics and research manager for PeopleForBikes, which has released the report for eight years. “We’re using the same data on every single city all around the world. And we’re using the best available data.”
Stonecipher said they take in information on roads and bike infrastructure and rate every street as high stress or low stress, which includes things like speed limits, number of lanes and what the impact that bike infrastructure is having on the street.
For Allen and some officials in the state’s capital city, the report triggered both surprise and skepticism.
“I think any sort of huge aggregate rankings like that, you have to take with a grain of salt,” he said. 
 Despite recent infrastructure improvements, Richmond ranks low

Richmond’s low ranking strikes Allen as odd, considering biking infrastructure improvements he’s witnessed over the past 10 years. 
“The infrastructure has gotten much better. Back when I first came here, I don’t think there was any,” Allen said. “There might have been a few striped bike lanes, but as far as something really safe and dedicated, there was nothing, and now there is a decent amount.”
The ranking also doesn’t sit well with Richmond city officials. In an email to the Virginia Mercury, they said even though PeopleForBikes appears to “have an up-to-date inventory of bike infrastructure, including recent trail projects, the methodology used for rating stress levels, while interesting, does not make sense.”
The report includes streets that are not in the city and are not owned by the city, officials cited. Cities like Richmond and counties are in charge of most of their streets, while the Virginia Department of Transportation manages the rest, such as Broad Street, as well as state highways.  
Richmond touts more than 80 miles of bike lanes and that they’ve been globally recognized by the “Dutch Cycling Embassy,” also pointed out, “and the National Association of City Transportation Officials have been praising Richmond’s approach to city building.”
New bike bill hopes to make streets safer for cyclists

Stonecipher said part of the reasons some cities’ ranking may be low is because of a lack of information provided by city officials. 
“All of our infrastructure data comes from OpenStreetMap, a platform where folks can go in and update their data themselves,” she said. “Every year before we do the city ratings, we send out a big email that says, ‘All right, everybody get in there and update your data. Show us all the cool things that you’ve done this year.’ And so we are reliant on public involvement.”
She said that because they’re rating so many cities around the world, they can’t go into every single city themselves, but “we love to work with local advocates, partners, (and) city planners to make sure that that data is as accurate as possible.”
Allen does say that the rankings are a good reminder that even though the city has come far over the past decade, there’s still a lot of work to do. 
“I think the takeaway is that, yes, this may not be the most perfect rating system, but I think it does highlight the places where we still need to make some improvements,” he said.
 So what’s the best biking city in Virginia? 

Cape Charles ranked as the number one biking spot in the commonwealth and also ranks 51st in the nation. Cape Charles is a small, Eastern Shore beach town in Northampton County with just under 1,300 residents. 
But is it fair to compare Cape Charles to larger cities? 
“One thing I noticed right off the bat is that all the rankings favor small cities,” said Allen. “Cape Charles, which I’ve been to, I wouldn’t say it’s like a biking paradise. It’s basically a town of three streets next to the bay.”
This is why PeopleForBikes allows users to use filters, such as by population, when selecting the best places to bike. The tool works best when people use it keeping context in mind.
“I would encourage folks to dig into the maps and try to understand why,” she said. “Roads that have bike infrastructure might still be high stress. Maybe you have bike lanes on two streets, but getting across the street is really difficult because the bike infrastructure stops 20 feet before the intersection.”
If residents of any locality are unsatisfied with their city or county’s ranking, they can put PeopleForBikes’ SPRINT principles into action to improve their score. The principles — which include safe speeds, protected bike lanes, reallocated space, intersection treatments, network connections and trusted data —  and their framework “enable your city to change high-stress streets into low-stress streets, providing safe and comfortable routes for bicyclists of all ages and abilities,” PeopleForBikes website reads.

(Photo courtesy of NBC12)After tragic flooding in Texas claimed dozens of lives and wreaked havoc in several communities, Virginia weather and emergency officials are pitching in to the Lone Star State’s recovery efforts and sharing how they prepare for major weather events here at home..
Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Sunday announced two of the state’s swift water rescue teams have been deployed to assist with rescue operations in Texas, as the state braces for more rain after flash flooding devastated its central region. The rescue teams are equipped with gear that is meant for traversing treacherous waters.
“Our hearts go out to the families and communities in Texas who have been devastated by these historic floods,” Youngkin said in a statement. “We stand in solidarity with the people of Texas, and we are committed to offering any and all support requested during this critical time.”
Before a weather event occurs, meteorologists from the National Weather Service’s regional offices provide critical forecasts. They are able, in most situations, to project how a weather system could move through the area and the best and worst case scenarios for storms. That information is relayed to state and local agencies who determine how to warn the public, stage supplies or possibly enact evacuation plans.
“Giving them that information so they can prepare and get assets to where they need to be situated is critical, well ahead of the storm,” said Michael Dutter, science and operations officers for the National Weather Service in Wakefield, one of three NWS offices in Virginia. “And then giving them frequent updates and any changes.”
The General Assembly invested over $102 million into the Department of Emergency Management for the current fiscal year. Those funds go towards emergency preparedness initiatives, recovery efforts, information systems and other related expenses.
Dutter said with some weather systems it can be hard to predict the exact rainfall amounts or a gauge of how the waterways will react to certain storms. For example, Tropical Storm Chantal, which developed off the coast of the Carolinas over the weekend, was disorganized last week, leading to a more challenging forecast for NWS scientists. In those cases, they have to work closely with agencies to give updates when their models update.
“We can give some good ideas about what could happen and other times we can’t. So I think that’s one of the harder things to really convey. People need to know information as soon as we know so they can make decisions. But sometimes we don’t know either, until the event gets closer,” Dutter said.
The Virginia Department of Emergency Management prompts the Virginia Emergency Support Team (VEST) to communicate with municipalities and first responders in disaster situations. Since the state is no stranger to severe water events, VDEM has a flood intel unit that focuses on flood impacts and makes risk-based decisions. They also use data from the gauge system to help predict how a storm may impact communities downstream.
“Our gauge network is important because it affords us to observe near real-time data to influence better prediction of downstream effects. These predictions and early warnings help keep Virginians safe – especially in underserved communities that may lack observational data to support residents and public safety officials,” a VDEM spokesperson said.
The department provides numerous resources to help communities plan for flood events and be able to monitor the rain gauges themselves so businesses can make informed decisions during a weather event.
Virginia has diverse geography that creates unique challenges in weather events. VDEM maps out its focus areas for each region of the commonwealth. 
“In the western regions of Virginia, steep terrain and deep valleys alternate to produce numerous micro-climates, each potentially different from the broader regional picture. The central Virginia urban corridor encompasses higher population density which can make a small shift of location in a forecasted rainfall event affect a significant amount of people and higher amounts of critical infrastructure,” the agency stated. Eastern and coastal Virginia possess thousands of miles of coastline and numerous small towns, all uniquely at risk of tidal flooding, flash flooding, and storm surge.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”










If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate. That’s almost a given here. 


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger


The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
Compromises
Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
Elsewhere
Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.










I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. 


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta


This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As Maine faces strain from cuts under the federal budget signed into law last week, some are eyeing tax increases on the wealthy as a mitigation strategy. 
In a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation last week, Gov. Janet Mills warned that the state can’t bear the loss of federal funding from several different avenues.
Currently, one out of every $5 in Maine’s economy comes from the federal government, which means the state relies heavily on federal resources, according to Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy. The loss of federal funding could somewhat be cushioned by raising taxes on the highest earners, he said, but the governor has been resistant to such a change.
“We are still leaving money on the table that could make a difference in terms of our ability to not only absorb these cuts,” Martin said, “but also to expand and continue to provide the kinds of services that we know help position people to be in a better place, to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.”
Federal changes to tax code
Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine attempted to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy with an amendment — which the Senate rejected — to the GOP budget bill. 
Maine’s entire congressional delegation ultimately voted against the budget that President Donald Trump signed into law on the Fourth of July, though Collins earlier cast a procedural vote to advance it. The budget extends the tax cuts predominantly benefitting high-income earners from Trump’s first term that were set to expire at the end of the year and adds additional tax breaks, but it also includes dozens of other provisions spanning border security, defense, health care and more. 
In her amendment, Collins proposed creating a new top marginal tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest income earners and using that revenue to double the size of a proposed rural hospital relief fund from $25 billion to $50 billion. 
“Rural providers, especially our rural hospitals and nursing homes, are under great financial strain right now, with many having recently closed and others being at risk of closing,” Collins said on the floor before the amendment vote. “This amendment would help keep them open and caring for those who live in rural communities.”
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

Millions of Americans are expected to lose access to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, through the budget’s slashed spending and new requirements. Collins described some of the cuts to Medicaid as “problematic” but said she supported adding work requirements to the health program, which constituted the largest cut.
In a statement to Politico after her addition failed, Collins criticized most Democrats for voting against it. “They’ve complained repeatedly about the distribution in this bill, of Medicaid cuts hurting individuals, rural hospitals, and tax cuts being extended for people who are wealthy,” Collins told Politico, “and yet when I tried to fix both those problems, they took a very hypocritical approach.”
U.S. Sen. Angus King of Maine was one of the few who voted for the amendment.
Meanwhile, Democrats argued it would be more logical to not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place, with Democratic U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon characterizing Collins’ amendment as a “Band-Aid on an amputation.” 
Maine still weighing a “millionaire’s tax” 
This session, the Maine Legislature considered raising taxes on the wealthy but opted to postpone deciding on the proposal until next year.  
Referred to as a “millionaire’s tax,” LD 1089 would place a tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers to be used to fund public K-12 education. 
After both chambers rejected the bill in initial votes, the Maine Senate later reversed its stance but the Maine House of Representatives did not take it up again before the Legislature adjourned last month. Instead, lawmakers included LD 1089 in a joint order carrying over the legislation into 2026, the second year of the 132nd session. 
Maine’s tax system does more to address income inequality than many other states’ structures, but only up until a point. While the share of income Maine’s poorest residents pay in taxes is lower than that paid by the wealthiest in the state, the richest actually pay a lower share of their earnings in taxes than middle income people.
“The bill before you today simply asks for our richest to share a slice of bread with those who turned the dough and made the loaf for them to eat,” bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) testified before the Taxation Committee when presenting her plan. “Our economy shouldn’t be balanced on the backs of the working class, yet it is.”  
While a millionaire’s tax could still be considered by the Legislature next year, it faces a steep path to passage. Mills is opposed to any income-based tax reform and her administration testified against LD 1089. 
Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in Maine’s Department of Administrative and Financial Services, warned the Taxation Committee that the surcharge would apply to a small population of taxpayers who have considerable control over when, where and whether to spend and often rely on volatile income sources, such as capital gains. 
“These factors mean this surcharge would be a volatile source of income for the state, which would increase the challenge of managing the state’s fiscal position and would likely increase the size of a revenue shortfall during an economic downturn,” Allen said.
During debate in the chambers, some lawmakers raised concern that wealthy people will leave if their taxes increase, but overall out migration has shown to be minimal in other states that have imposed similar tax increases. 
Originally, LD 1089 sought to tax income over $1 million by a higher amount — an additional 4% — which would have mirrored a law passed in Massachusetts two years ago. The number of ultra wealthy residents in Massachusetts has grown since then, according to a study released this spring from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive research group. 
A pro-business coalition has pushed back, pointing out that the data used to determine income also included investments, which the surcharge does not apply to, and that the Massachusetts Society of CPAs has raised concern about the number of high-income clients changing their primary state of residence. However, the authors of the IPS report argued that while some may be motivated to leave because of the surcharge, it has been a small minority so far. 
Martin pointed to such findings when arguing that the state is still capable of mitigating the cuts likely coming from the federal level. The budget’s tax breaks for the wealthy will also in turn reduce government revenue.
“Part of what we can do is, at a minimum, make sure that the wealthy people, who are benefiting the most from the federal changes, pay their fair share at the state level,” Martin said. 
The Maine Legislature also carried over a bill, LD 229, which would increase the base of the state’s tax brackets. It would do this by both increasing the number of tax brackets and by adding a top tax bracket for high income earners.
LD 1879, which would raise the tax rate on corporations to support the agricultural economy, has also been carried over. Mills has already publicly opposed both bills.

Kelly Ayotte signed a bill last month that establishes a study committee for housing investment trusts. (Getty Images)For developers of affordable housing, one problem often towers over the others: finding funding.
By pledging to keep rents low, property owners may be providing needed opportunities. But that lower rent can mean lower returns, and a slimmer chance that lenders will approve financing. 
The result is that successful affordable housing projects are often cobbled together with a mix of funding mechanisms, from private financing to state and federal affordable housing dollars, many of which are competitive to obtain. 
This year, some lawmakers are exploring establishing a new type of funding option to add to the mix: the housing investment trust. 
Proponents are pushing for a law allowing for a trust that could operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, accept donations and other funds, and develop or restore buildings for housing development. And last month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation, House Bill 633, to study the issue.
The proposal has been championed by Michael Dell Orfano, an Amherst real estate developer, and Rep. Gary Daniels, a Milford Republican. As originally introduced, HB 633 would have created a new form of investment trust in New Hampshire law known as the housing investment trust, and require that trust to be a charitable organization.
The original bill would have also required that there be three trustees to oversee that trust, which could be a resident, a different charitable organization, a bank, or a credit union. 
After that, the original bill is silent on how the trust might carry out charitable activity to support housing. Dell Orfano says the trust could buy land or properties, renovate buildings, develop units, and create arrangements allowing those units to be rented affordably. 
The trust would have to be either a qualifying tax-exempt organization under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or be recognized as charitable under the state’s definition.
Funding for the trust, according to Dell Orfano, could come from a revolving loan fund that could accept investments from outside funds or individuals and re-invest the returns on those investments into the fund.
Dell Orfano has proposed three investment classes within the fund: a debt class, a capital gains class, and a class for self-directed investments. 
“The important takeaway here is that that is entirely independent,” said Dell Orfano, speaking about the revolving fund. “You think of Fidelity, Wellington Management, or New Hampshire’s own Pax World funds. These are the financial institutions that we’ll eventually be dealing with.” 
In total, the mechanism could allow developers to access financing aside from state, federal, or other private funds, supporters say.
“What we are bringing to you is something unique, something we haven’t really seen in this legislature before, and that’s a private sector solution that can be added to the toolbox,” said Daniels, speaking to the Senate Commerce Committee. “We see plenty of bills coming in that look to do different things with the public sector funds.”
That tool could create the possibility of innovative housing developments, supporters say.
New Hampshire continues to experience a severe housing crisis, as median home prices have hit record levels and as rents rise faster than median income levels. Housing trusts, supporters say, could allow for arrangements such as traditional rental units, cooperative housing, supportive housing, and others, and could make those arrangements short term or long term.
But lawmakers say they need more time to understand the trusts before moving ahead with creating them, and by the time the bill left the House Judiciary Committee in March, the committee had proposed amending it to be a study committee.
“Although establishing another study committee is not ideal, the Judiciary Committee believes this is an important enough issue given the housing crisis that the House should investigate in collaboration with the (Senate),” wrote Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican who is also the chairman of the House Housing Committee, in March. 
That version, which Ayotte signed in June, will create a committee of three house members and one senator, who will work to produce a report by Nov. 1.
The investment trust proposal has received the endorsement of Housing Action New Hampshire, which supports affordable housing developments; New Hampshire Housing, the state agency that operates the affordable housing fund; and NeighborWorks, a nonprofit developer of affordable homes.
And it models arrangements in other states, such as Arizona, which allows counties to establish housing trust funds to make similar investments. 
In testimony to lawmakers this year, Robert Tourigny, executive director of NeighborWorks Southern New Hampshire, said the trusts could allow for both preservation of historical homes and buildings and the creation of new supply. 
“One of the challenges associated with preserving affordability has been the limited financing mechanisms available to consumers outside of conventional long-term financing,” Tourigny said. “A housing investment trust will provide an opportunity to leverage private capital while maintaining affordability for the homebuyer.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/housingmarket-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 05:59:15.738250

The newly established legal procedure gives defendants a tool to dismiss frivolous lawsuits filed suppress their protected speech.
According to the Institute for Free Speech, 38 states have now passed laws protecting against strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP.
The lawsuit concerns a divorced couple. The ex-wife, Maegin George, works as a nurse while the ex-husband, Jonathan George, is president of Conn’s Potato Chips.

Jonathan George filed a defamation suit alleging that after he began a new relationship, Maegin George falsely accused him of pedophilia, incest, and attempting to pay for sex.
Maegin George argues she has not said many of the things her ex-husband claims, and what she has said is not defamatory and protected by the First Amendment.
She’s asking the court to conduct an anti-SLAPP review and dismiss the case.
Ohio’s law
State lawmakers approved Ohio’s anti-SLAPP statute, Senate Bill 237, in the final days of the last legislative session. In both chambers, the measure passed without a single ‘no’ vote.
The bill’s co-sponsors, state Sens. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville, and Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, explained SLAPP suits can take several different forms, including defamation or nuisance lawsuits. What holds them together, though, is their aim — to “silence or intimidate an individual for exercising their rights to free speech.”
“Such lawsuits,” Gavarone explained in committee, “send a message to potential critics that those who speak out will face stress, time commitments, and expensive legal bills over a period of months or even years that many defendants cannot endure.”
The proposal had the backing of a wide array of interest groups, from the ACLU and news organizations to domestic violence groups and the state bar. Ohio’s measure adopts language drafted by the Uniform Law Commission, a non-partisan group of lawyers, judges and professors who develop draft legislation that states can adopt.
The law establishes a fast-track review process, where defendants can argue the lawsuit is frivolous or related to their protected speech. Filing that motion halts other proceedings like discovery, which limits costs and so-called fishing expedition tactics. Both parties have opportunities to appeal along the way, but if the judge determines the lawsuit is meant to stifle speech, it gets dismissed.
The engine driving SLAPP suits, ACLU chief lobbyist Gary Daniels explained, is a power or financial imbalance between the two parties.
“A well-known scenario is grassroots activists speaking out about environmental, safety, or other concerns only to be sued or countersued for their advocacy,” Daniels said. The person filing a SLAPP suit against them doesn’t care if they win or lose in court. “Instead, they know the massive costs of litigation and legal defense act as a barrier against those without adequate financial resources to fight back and defend themselves.”
Monica Nieporte from the Ohio News Media Association explained news outlets are a frequent target of the SLAPP playbook.
“Newspapers in Ohio have been sued for defamation simply for running an article, editorial, or even a political cartoon,” she told state lawmakers. “The goal of these suits is not to prevail and receive damages, but to stifle and suppress protected expression.”
More troubling, Bridget Mahoney explained, without anti-SLAPP legislation on the books, abusers can turn the court system against their victims. Mahoney is the former board chair of the Ohio Domestic Violence Network. Divorcing her abusive ex-husband started a 20-year court battle. When Mahoney and her daughter began advocating for other survivors, Mahoney’s ex-husband filed a defamation case. She described depositions and discovery stretching on for years, forcing her to relive some of her worst experiences and costing her more than $100,000.
“Anyone in Ohio who comes forward to tell their story or report a sexual assault are vulnerable to the same debilitating frivolous lawsuit that we endured,” Mahoney said. She stressed that the law wouldn’t limit her ex-husband or anyone else’s right to sue. “What it will do is give us and others like us a tool so that we are safer to exercise our freedom of speech.”
The case in Cambridge
Maegin George sees something similar in the case Jonathan George filed against her. She filed sworn statements from the people referenced in ex-husband’s complaint stating she never alleged he “committed any sexual misconduct, incest, or pedophilia.” She acknowledged telling one individual that he was friends with a minor on Snapchat but made no accusation of incest.
She goes on to argue her “communications, to the extent they occurred, addressed issues of public concern — particularly the safety and propriety of Mr. George’s interactions with minors — and thus are shielded by the First Amendment.”
That point is key to the new anti-SLAPP case analysis. The process plays out in three steps. First, the judge must determine if the allegations arise from protected speech. Next, the court has to weigh whether those initial allegations are legitimate on their face. Finally, the judge considers if the underlying case is legally viable.
In short, the process asks the court to take a long hard look at what’s being alleged before submitting both parties to a potentially arduous and costly ordeal.
Maegin George’s attorney Austin Warehime argues the case against her is often vague and poorly supported by the evidence.
“Ohio finally has a powerful shield for everyday people who speak out,” he argued, noting the case is one of the first anti-SLAPP motions in the state. “We’re asking the court to apply that shield exactly as the legislature intended — swiftly and decisively.”
Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing Jonathan George dismissed those claims out of hand.
“The notion that our client is trying to suppress protected free speech is literally nonsensical,” he said.
Shamansky called the contention that George is a public figure because he heads up a prominent local business “utter bulls—.”
“Does that mean anybody that owns a business is a public figure? It’s absurd,” he said, adding they’re looking forward to their day in court.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border, and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky, and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses, and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)Kansans now confront a “big, beautiful bill” approved by 218 Republican puppets in the U.S. House, and then signed into law by a convicted felon who was found guilty of sexual abuse, and who has faced multiple criminal cases over the past few years. Many of his indictments went to the core principles of our democracy. Unlike the average American, he has been given free pass after free pass by a Supreme Court that exists primarily to do his bidding — never mind right and wrong.
Is all of this part of a bad dream? If only that were the case.
We are bombarded by distortions perpetuated by hundreds of millions of dollars of “dark money” used via social media. Our reliance on that device in the palm of our hands has become a seductive tool to manipulate the masses. It’s how our president was bought and sold. Those devices supposedly foster connections, but the reality seems to be that they fuel isolation, especially at a time when we need to talk to each other.
How to make sense of the absurd? How to square any of this with the founding principles of this country, or with the role that the United States has come to play in an increasingly troubled world? I am not certain that Camus and Kafka, working in collaboration, could put all of this madness into words.
We now confront darkness.
For those of us old enough to remember, words from one of the most memorable Simon and Garfunkel songs come to mind: “Hello, darkness, my old friend, I’ve come to talk to you again.” Darkness leads to isolation, and that leads to lack of communication, along with feelings of hopelessness. There is much darkness now among a large segment of the population as we see actions, and hear words, that we know reveal a lack of morality, of decency, among many of our elected officials.


How to cope with these feelings? How to figure out how to make a difference?
For me, strength comes from being in a place that brings good memories, comfort and perspective. That place is in the midst of an ocean of wheat on one of our farms. I stand alone with my thoughts, in the presence of earth and sky as far as my eyes can see. I realize that I am but a speck in the universe, but I gain strength in knowing that, by my actions, I can make a difference.
Darkness is countered by light. By speaking out, and speaking the truth, we can begin to bring about change. There is fear among the populace about speaking out, because we have already seen some actions from this administration that are eerily reminiscent of tactics used by prior and current fascist regimes.
A student whom I am mentoring asked me about taking a summer job with a law firm that had caved into demands from the Trump administration.
She asked: “How do I decide?”
I said the answer is simple — look in the mirror and ask yourself if you are doing the right thing. Your conscience will be your guide. That basic idea applies here, too. My mirror is my wheat field. For others, it may be an actual mirror, or it could be some other place, another person or a certain event in your life.
Just remember that, in these dark times, silence in the midst of what you know is wrong will lead only to more darkness. Remember that we have a limited number of days. Why speak out? Because it matters.

When North Carolinians elected Gov. Josh Stein last fall by a wide margin over former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, they made clear they wanted to put a check on GOP lawmakers’ ambitions to take the state down extreme right-wing paths.
And in recent days, to his great credit, Stein has validated the trust that voters placed in him by vetoing a series of extreme and ill-conceived bills.
As the governor made clear in rejecting bills that would, among other things, roll back environmental protections and raise residential electric bills, invest new and unprecedented powers in the state auditor, effectively deregulate charter schools, and enact a virtually incoherent ban on diversity, equity and inclusion in state government, Republican lawmakers have lost their way.
The bottom line: At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, Stein observed, the legislature needs to get to work and pass a budget and stop wasting time with divisive culture war bills.
And the voters said: Amen.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)“As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.” The old adage used to apply to the state when Ohio was regarded as a perfect microcosm of America (with its regional, socioeconomic, and political diversity) and thus an influential bellwether in presidential elections. 
But that was before extreme gerrymandering carved up state voting districts to engineer failsafe Republican supermajorities in the legislature — which cemented the statewide GOP trifecta of executive and judicial overlords who rule Ohio as a partisan fiefdom that passes for representative government.   
The phrase that once signified Ohio’s status as a major swing state, whose character and composition mirrored the country’s, has been turned on its head. Today it would read, “As the nation goes, under Trump-genuflecting lemmings on Capitol Hill, so goes Ohio.” It is a reliably red state in lockstep with MAGA extremism writ large. In 2025, it is a perfect microcosm of the right-wing autocracies that have overtaken other bygone battleground states. 
Statehouse Republicans spin the same culture war nonsense as their MAGA counterparts do in over half of the state legislatures they control nationwide. They advance the same Big Money interests of the same Big Campaign Donors, codify the same heartless indifference to the suffering of the powerless, and worship the same convicted felon, convicted sexual abuser, convicted fraudster, and attempted coup-plotter who got away with fomenting an insurrection against the U.S. government to disrupt constitutional business and try to overthrow the results of a free and fair election. 
Both GOP lawmakers in Columbus and in Congress just passed objectively regressive, and oppressive budgets that will both take food from the hungry, cut health care insurance for tens of millions of working-class poor, and force Medicaid-dependent nursing homes and already struggling rural hospitals to close or contract. 
Why? To partially offset huge transfers of wealth to the ultra-rich from the poorest Americans on the state and federal level. The hungriest and neediest among us are throwaway line items in GOP state and federal budgets crafted for the rich and powerful.
  U.S. President Donald Trump and Ohio Republican U.S. Senator JD Vance. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.)
JD Vance, the former Ohio senator and unrecognizable author of Hillbilly Elegy, even suggested the suffering of many (from devastating federal cuts to Medicaid and food stamps) was worth it to give Immigration and Enforcement its single largest funding increase in history.  
Tell that to the estimated 17 million people being kicked off Medicaid nationwide or seniors being pushed out of nursing homes without medical coverage or children going hungry with the deepest cuts ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, (SNAP). 
The veep, who cast the tie-breaking vote for Trump’s Billionaire First Budget in the Senate, essentially said their pain was beside the point. 
What Vance values is super-charging ICE’s nationwide terrorism campaign against illegal and legal immigrants (many without any criminal record) with a fortified police state of masked thugs in unmarked vehicles who disappear human beings off the streets. 
He was euphoric about the federal budget’s giant infusion of cash (around $170 billion) for the agency. 
“Everything else — the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] score, the proper baseline, the minutiae (italics, mine) of the Medicaid policy — is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions.”  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
To Vance apparently, the unforced hardships on Ohioans and citizens across America are irrelevant compared to boosting ICE’s capacity to detain and deport racially profiled day laborers in Home Depot parking lots or those doing backbreaking work in farm fields, restaurants, hotels, landscaping, etc. 
The massive influx in ICE funding allows Trump’s secretive army, without IDs, warrants, or due process, to become what a prominent immigration attorney called “the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in history.”  
Vance is on a futile odyssey to stop non-white demographic change in America at any cost. 
His message to Ohioans who will lose health insurance for medical care and life-saving treatment, or the 1 in 9 low-income, elderly, and disabled residents in the state who will lose federal food assistance — is suck it up because detention camps are expensive. 
Tell that to the 62% of Ohio households that participate in SNAP in families with children.  
Every Ohio Republican on Capitol Hill voted for the fiscally irresponsible, debt-exploding, Medicaid-slashing Trump bill so billionaires and corporate conglomerates could get a $3.4 trillion tax cut on the backs of poor and working-class Americans. 
Likewise, nearly every Ohio Republican in the Statehouse voted for the Big Jimmy and Dee Haslam Private Welfare Bill, blessed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, that rewards the wealthy with tax cuts, gives lavish handouts to NFL billionaires and allocates nearly $2.5 billion for private school vouchers to affluent families. 
Yet the same GOP budget forces public schools, public libraries, state-funded child care, food banks, pediatric cancer research, and more to make do with less.
At least the Haslams can walk away with a cool $600 million to take the Browns out of Cleveland and Trump’s Mar a Lago pals can pocket another windfall in tax cuts they don’t need. 
As Ohio’s MAGA conformists in Congress go, transferring resources from the poor and middle class to the rich, so goes Ohio’s Republican supermajority in Columbus.
 But the rest of us still have agency to demand better than gutted safety net programs, cancelled health insurance and defunded public education to subsidize opulent lifestyles and domed stadiums. As Ohio goes is ultimately up to Ohioans who give a damn.

The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.

‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care.

It was a significant day for me, having grown up around the world among soldiers, sailors, airmen and their families.
  The author’s father in his dorm room at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. (Submitted photo)
My father, George Wees, was born in Omaha to second-generation Polish immigrants. His father, Francis Wees, built houses in South Omaha, including the house he, my grandmother, and their nine children called home near 38th and G Streets. Dad attended Creighton Prep and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1958.
I was born a few years later, in Heidelberg, in then-West Germany. Young Lt. Wees was on one of his early assignments working with the newly established West German military, via a NATO attachment, to establish secure government communications networks just miles away from Soviet-allied East Germany.
In 1966, dad received orders for Vietnam. He was to advise a South Vietnamese Army unit in the burgeoning conflict between the communist North and the democratic South. He parked my mother and us kids in a little duplex in East Omaha, and oﬀ he went to spend a year on the other side of the globe.
Communicating with us
I remember he furnished us with a little tape recorder and microphone, and he and my mother exchanged tapes, in addition to near-daily letters, during his deployment. She still has the tapes.
In some of his messages, you hear the gunfire in the distance. And at those times, you hear a bit of unsteadiness in the young lieutenant’s voice.
When Dad returned in 1967, he was stationed at the Pentagon, now a Captain. We lived in a little house across from a park in Vienna, Virginia, where I attended kindergarten and first grade.
It was there that I really got to know him. He set up a darkroom in the basement to pursue his photography hobby, bought a Mustang for the Pentagon commute and patiently hosted siblings from Omaha who wanted to come visit Washington.
But by 1969, it was time for his second tour in Vietnam. Back we came to Omaha, to another little house on 43rd and Center, a rental owned by friends. There my mother, sister and I would wait out another year of war. That is, if dad survived.
By this time, things were less taut, less military, and problems extended from the front to the rear. In command of American troops near Nha Trang, dad survived at least one attempt on his life—from his own troops.
Because by this point, many of the young draftees were convinced the war was pointless.
Lives of service
Eventually, after resisting the notion for years, Col. Wees agreed with me that the war, through Democratic and Republican administrations, was ill-conceived and badly executed. In other words, pointless.
But we should remember that rank and file soldiers like my dad only served. None of it was their idea, nor did they make the big decisions. That was the province of civilian leadership in Washington — folks who would soon be ousted, many imprisoned, with a president resigning in disgrace.

Our current civilian leader, who has already been disgraced by multiple felony convictions and a civil sexual abuse judgment against him, used the occasion of the Army’s birthday to throw a party and have a parade.
The Army, as always, followed the commander-in-chief’s orders and rolled the tanks down Constitution Avenue in a light rain as the president attempted a few salutes. Nearby, at Arlington National Cemetery, my father rested.
Though drafted, the president never served (bone spurs), and according to witnesses, he has labeled as “suckers and losers” some rank-and-file soldiers who make up the service. His campaign-style speech to West Point’s 2025 graduating class — complete with MAGA hat — was thin on talk of duty or honor.
But those cadets did what cadets do. They listened to the president troll and dismiss his predecessor, threaten his political “enemies”, invent “facts”, and brag about himself, without visibly reacting, except to politely applaud as they shared their achievement with the commander-in-chief.
That’s what it looks like when doing one’s duty, honorably, for one’s country. It looks like discipline, because that’s what is required to lead. Happy 250th to the United States Army. May you continue to serve and protect the Constitution, and to quietly obey the lawful orders of whatever civilian leadership the voters place above you, for centuries to come.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)A late June heat wave led to skyrocketing emergency room visits and boosted the number of heat deaths this year from one to eight in a single week, according to the latest state numbers.
The data from the Maryland Department of Health showed that 472 people had to go to urgent care or the emergency room for heat-related illnesses from June 22 through June 28, a week in which the National Weather Service said parts of Maryland would see a heat index of up to 110 degrees during the hottest parts of the day.
That’s a significant increase from the previous week, when 93 people landed in emergency departments across the state, and trends higher than previous heat-related illness data from recent years.
High temperatures that week also resulted in seven deaths, raising the total number of heat-related deaths so far this heat season to eight, with months left to go in the season. State health officials and county emergency workers are warning residents to take caution in similar conditions in the days ahead.

“We are very saddened to report these heat-related deaths in Maryland,” said David McCallister, a communications official with the health department, in a written statement Monday. “As we experience more hot days this summer, these tragedies remind us to take the necessary steps to avoid overheating.
“Be sure to always check on family, friends, and neighbors who may be particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens and people with chronic diseases,” his statement said.
The data is part of weekly reporting on heat-related illnesses during the annual heat season, which runs roughly from the end of April through September.
“Demographic patterns remain consistent with previous years: ED [emergency department] visits are highest among males (63%), individuals aged 18-44 (43%), and white individuals (53%),” McCallister’s statement said. “Of the eight deaths reported so far, 88% were among males and 63% were among white individuals. Most notably, 75% of deaths occurred in individuals aged 65 and older.”
He said that there have been a total of 729 recorded heat-related emergency department visits so far, “making up over 60% of the total number of visits reported during the entire 2024 heat season.”
“It is also important to note that 65% of visits have occurred in Health Regions 3 and 5, which encompass the Baltimore City area and the National Capital Region,” he said.


Danielle Knatz, bureau chief for the Baltimore County Fire Department’s Emergency Medical Services, said the heat wave during the last week of June led to a greater demand in emergency response services.
“We did see a slight increase in our heat-related responses, and most of them appear to be incidents that occurred outside of the home. So parking lots, restaurants, streets, highways — likely people working outside,” Knatz said. “A couple related to swimming pools or water, but not too many.”
She said that most of the emergency room visits in Baltimore County were connected to heat exhaustion from physical activity, though other people who ended up in Baltimore County emergency rooms faced different challenges.
“We had several that were elderly. Elderly and younger patients don’t respond well to changes in the climate,” she said. “(There) could be underlying conditions that are causing those people to have difficulties, or certain medications that they’re taking. That was pretty much what we were seeing that week.”
She said the EMS agency uses the heat-related illness data to track trends across the county and help crews be prepared to the next heat wave.
“For example, for this week, we front-loaded our units with extra cold packs to be able to handle these types of incidents,” she said. “Because obviously, there are times when we want to aggressively cool patients, so we want to make sure that we have cold packs to be able to do that.”
Maryland heads into summer with new workplace protections following deadly 2024 heat season

The National Weather Service issued heat advisories Monday for parts of central Maryland the Eastern Shore through Tuesday. The agency said to expect heat index values up to 105 degrees, with “up to 107 degrees closer to the Chesapeake Bay.”
Under those conditions, workplaces in high temperature environments are expected to implement additional heat safety measures under new state labor regulations that launched this year. That includes more frequent and longer breaks for workers and additional cooling measures on worksites.
Knatz urges families to take caution for the remainder of the heat season.
“It’s important for people to just monitor the weather and be prepared,” she said. “By taking appropriate rests, by drinking plenty of fluids.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson knows that school administrators “should be thrilled that parents want to be involved” in their children’s education.
Bulson also knows that there can be a point when parents get too involved, acknowledging the potential administrative burden of trying to anticipate everything that a parent might find objectionable in the classroom.
His comments were in response to the recent Supreme Court ruling that said Montgomery County schools need to notify parents when LGBTQ-themed books are used in the classroom, and give parents the chance to opt their children out.
“If parents do find something objectionable, we need to be willing to discuss it.,” Bulson said. “I really think at the center of this, is the willingness to listen to families, communicate with them, and frankly, be open to the fact that parents make these [opt out] decisions for many reasons.”
Bulson’s not the only one grappling with the fallout of the court’s June 27 ruling — which merely granted a preliminary injunction in the case and ordered it back to lower courts, which have yet to hold a hearing on the merits of the case, only on motions.
Attorneys for both the parents and the school system told a federal district judge Monday that, pending paperwork from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, they hope to sit down to see if they can work out an agreement on a preliminary injunction while the case proceeds.
The court’s 6-3 ruling in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor said that while the case is being heard, the Montgomery County School Board “should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.”
The ruling came in response to county’s inclusion, in 2022, of LGBTQ-themed books in all grade levels in county schools. After initially allowing parents to opt their children out, the county reversed itself in 2023.
  One of the books highlighted in U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling June 27 entitled “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding.” Screenshot.
That eventually led to a lawsuit by parents, who said that picture books like “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” “Prince & Knight” and “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope” were not appropriate for their children in lower grades and that, in some instances, the books’ messages contradicted the families’ religious beliefs.
Suzie Scott of Harford County said the court’s decision represents “a huge win” for parental rights.
“It’s crazy that the Supreme Court had to weigh in on something so common sense,” said Scott, who serves as chair of Moms for Liberty Maryland Legislative Committee. “The parents that brought this case are not trying to tell the school what they can and can’t teach. They’re just saying, ‘I don’t want my child to be exposed to certain literature that is opposed to my moral viewpoint.’”
But Phillip Westry, executive director with the LGBTQ advocacy group FreeState Justice in Baltimore, said the ruling could eventually led to removing aspects of certain historical figures. He points to the late Harvey Milk, a Navy veteran and one of the first openly gay elected officials when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977: On the day of the court’s ruling, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on his social media page that the Navy would the USNS Harvey Milk to the USNS Oscar V. Peterson.
“There is a concern from FreeState Justice that this ruling will create an erasure of LGBTQ people from areas in history, in government, in literature, in science,” said Westry, who’s also an attorney. “It makes for a messy situation to educate our kids in a public setting.”
Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion for the court, said the school board’s “introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion.” He said the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims, and ordered the preliminary injunction.
In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — wrote the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
The case will eventually go back to the U.S. District Court of Maryland in Greenbelt for a full hearing.
“Now that the court issue has been decided [and] the parents are entitled to a preliminary injunction, our hope and expectation is that the parties and the District Court can work to implement the court’s decision and finally resolve the case,” said Michael O’Brien, one of the attorneys for the parents.

A Montgomery County schools spokesperson said in an email Wednesday that the county would not comment beyond the joint status report that was filed Monday with the district court.
‘Parents have sovereignty’
State law allows parents to opt their children out of instruction that deals with “family life and human sexuality instruction.” But Montgomery County officials eventually ruled that the policy did not apply to the LGBTQ books and materials that were part of the school’s literature program, which they called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
So a group of county Muslim, Jewish and Catholic parents filed a suit that to challenge use of the books that feature some same-sex or transgender characters in classes as early as prekindergarten.
Lindsey Smith, who isn’t part of the suit, is credited as one of the first people to speak out against the Montgomery County school board’s decision more than two years ago to incorporate the books into classroom instruction.
Smith, who had two elementary-school aged children in the school system during that time, founded the county’s Moms for Liberty chapter established in January 2023. She’s no longer a part of the organization.
In an interview, she recalled how some parents who complained were called “bigots” and told to “shut up and be silent.”
“My kids were not mature enough to handle some of the books,” said Smith, whose children now attend private school. “The parents have the sovereignty and the right to have their voices heard and to be able to have their voice used in the public school education. We’re the ones that pay for it.”
But educators worry that the ruling “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,” as Sotomayor put it.
David Stein, president of the Montgomery County Education Association, agrees with Sotomayor’s opinion on how the ruling “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools.”

“If one child needs to opt out on Monday for this book, but another child needs to opt out on Wednesday for another book, it’s unworkable and it’s just an incredible burden on that teacher,” said David Stein, president of the Montgomery County Education Association.
“I’m worried about what happens in high school biology class,” said Stein, who taught high school biology for 30 years. “We want to talk about evolution, or we want to talk about vaccines. Teachers are going to have to keep track of all these different these objections that various families may have.”
Bulson said it’s impossible for school systems to anticipate everything that’s objectionable. He said one of his main focuses is to simply communicate with parents in his district, which he said has experienced few opt-out requests from parents.
“I do have a pretty firm line, which is I’ll talk to you about what affects your children, but I would equally defend the importance of sustaining a line where individual parents don’t get to speak for other families’ children,” Bulson said. “I still think schools have an important role to play in ensuring all students feel included.”
Montgomery County mom Taylor Tuckerman said she and her husband read various books to their son, who turns 3 this month, including those that include LGBTQ+ themes. One her son has become engaged with is “Plenty of Hugs,” which features a family with two mothers.
“It’s just really upsetting to me to think that in two years, he and his friends are going to go into kindergarten and not have these same books available to them,” said Tuckerman, a vice president of finance and shared services with Catholics for Choice.
“The Supreme Court decided that it’s OK for other parents to teach their children to discriminate and judge people who are different from them and to force that same judgement into my son’s public classrooms,” she said. “We believe people of all faiths should feel welcomed and included and that includes LGBTQ families of faith.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC03677-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 03:58:46.746514

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)A second federal district judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate AmeriCorps workers who were laid off without notice in April and to restore $400 million in funding and grants to nonprofit organizations.
The preliminary injunction handed down Monday by District Judge Matthew Maddox comes a month and two days after a similar ruling in a separate AmeriCorps case in Maryland by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman — whose ruling is quoted heavily by Maddox.
Both judges blocked moves by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shut down AmeriCorps programs, including the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and various state and private grant programs.
Boardman ruled in favor of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued to block the DOGE cuts. Maddox ruled in favor of a number of nonprofits from around the country, members of an AmeriCorps labor union and three AmeriCorps service members.
Both cases were a response to DOGE moves in mid-April to immediately terminate all NCCC projects, along with 2,000 NCCC participants, and to put more than 600 AmeriCorps staffers — about 85% of the agency’s staff — on administrative leave, to be laid off less than two weeks later. Workers were ordered to immediately stop working and were locked out of AmeriCorps offices, email and other systems.

Maddox said the workers and nonprofits that sued the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs AmeriCorps, were likely to win on their claims that the abrupt government cuts were made without authority, failed to follow appropriate procedures and were likely to cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.
Maddox wrote that the government “cancelled approximately $400 million in AmeriCorps grants and terminated funding to both direct grantees and subgrantees of State Service Commission…. These actions have led to significant disruptions in the delivery of services that were previously funded by AmeriCorps and provided by the Nonprofit Plaintiffs.”
“This disruption has included the termination or suspension of assistance with college applications, provision of teachers to Indigenous school districts, housing assistance for low-income families, childhood literacy programs, summer and afterschool learning programs, and neighborhood revitalization programs, among other services,” he wrote.
Maddox ordered the return of roughly $400 million in funding to 14 nonprofits that had grants to do AmeriCorps work, the reinstatement of hundreds of AmeriCorps Employees Union Local 2027 members who were put on administrative leave on April 15 and subsequently laid off, and the return of three AmeriCorps members who lost their positions as a result of the cuts.
Boardman had ordered much of the same in her June 5 order.
Besides Maryland and Washington, D.C., other states that sued, and are subject to Boardman’s preliminary injunction, are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Maddox’s order affects three unnamed AmeriCorps members as well as about 400 members of AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why Connecticut needs wildlife funding now more than ever,Viewpoints Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/why-connecticut-needs-wildlife-funding-now-more-than-ever/,"Without the renewal of essential federal grants, projects protecting vital Connecticut wildlife will stall or vanish.","A quiet stream in northwest Connecticut, hidden beneath a forest canopy and shielded from development, holds more than scenic charm. In these protected waters—part of a watershed that ultimately supplies drinking water to the City of Waterbury—rare freshwater mussels cling to the cobble bottom. Their presence isn’t just a curiosity; it indicates that the water is clean, the ecosystem is functioning, and a community of native species is benefiting in these waters and along the riverbanks.
In recent years, I had the opportunity to conduct mussel surveys at this site alongside staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s (DEEP) Wildlife Diversity Unit and researchers from the University of Massachusetts. The work was supported by a federal program that most people have never heard of—the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program. It’s one of the most important, yet underappreciated, funding sources for wildlife conservation in the country.
And it’s currently in jeopardy.

James Fischer
These grants fund science-driven work to conserve Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), with an emphasis on those that are under-surveyed, declining, or critical to ecosystem health. In Connecticut, these efforts not only help ensure wildlife survival, but also protect public health, drinking water, pollinator services, and sustainable recreation. Yet the Trump administration did not renew funding for the program—a decision that could have ripple effects for decades across our state and region.
These grants supported, for example, the Biodiversity of Bees in Connecticut, authored by Tracy Zarrillo and Dr. Kimberly Stoner at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. This pioneering project catalogs the extraordinary diversity of bees in our state. Connecticut’s agriculture, native plant communities, and ecosystem stability all rely on pollinators, yet bees face widespread decline due to habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide overuse.
Zarrillo and Stoner’s ‘Biodiversity of bees’ is both a scientific achievement and a tool for recovery. It will help landowners, farmers, educators, and municipalities make informed decisions about planting, land use, and pesticide management. It also serves as a warning. The disappearance of invertebrates—described by scientists as “death by a thousand cuts”—threatens the pollination systems that sustain our crops, gardens, and wild spaces. Without continued monitoring and restoration efforts like those outlined in the Bee Atlas, we risk losing these species before we even know they’re gone.
Amphibians and reptiles, too, are benefiting from State and Tribal Wildlife Grant-funded work. Conservationists in Connecticut are collaborating with regional partners to monitor a newly emerging fungal pathogen that poses a dire threat to salamanders. If this disease takes hold, it could devastate populations of red-backed salamanders, one of the most abundant vertebrates in our northeastern forests. In most forests, they outnumber white-footed mice and even white-tailed deer.
These salamanders are small but mighty. They serve as prey for birds and mammals and help regulate invertebrate populations on the forest floor. Their disappearance would trigger cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. We’ve seen what happens when a deadly fungus goes unchecked: the white-nose syndrome that decimated bat populations across the Northeast is a cautionary tale. The damage it inflicted will take generations to undo.
What ties all of these stories together—mussels, bees, salamanders—is that they are not charismatic megafauna. They don’t appear on bumper stickers or spark multi-million dollar fundraising campaigns. But they are essential. They are ecological cogs and wheels, quietly keeping systems in balance and signaling the health of the environments we all share.
As Aldo Leopold, the father of wildlife ecology, wrote: “To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.” These grants allow us to do just that—study, monitor, and safeguard the less visible but deeply consequential components of our natural world.
The work supported by State and Tribal Wildlife Grants also fosters collaboration across jurisdictions. Scientists, wildlife agencies, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions are able to coordinate efforts, share data, and respond to emerging threats more effectively. In a small state like Connecticut, where watersheds cross town lines and migratory species traverse hundreds of miles, this kind of cooperation is indispensable.
Importantly, the public also has a role to play. Connecticut’s State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP)—the foundational document that guides how these grant funds are used—is currently under revision and will soon be available for public comment. This is the moment for Connecticut residents to engage.
The SWAP identifies at-risk species, outlines conservation goals, and informs local planning efforts. It’s a practical tool that connects wildlife conservation to broader concerns—clean air and water, healthy soils, sustainable land use, and resilience to climate change. A well-informed and engaged citizenry can ensure that the plan reflects both scientific priorities and community values. When residents speak up, decision-makers listen.
Yet all of this depends on reliable funding. Without the renewal of State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, these vital projects will stall or vanish. Agencies and researchers will be left scrambling to piece together alternative sources. The long-term consequences won’t be immediate or dramatic, but they will be real. We’ll see more species quietly disappear. More ecosystem functions will falter. More opportunities to act early will be lost. Connecticut’s congressional delegates are on board with maintaining support. I urge you to contact all your friends and family in other states to reach out to their representatives, as this issue affects every state and all wildlife populations throughout the country.
And it doesn’t have to be this way.
We have the knowledge. We have the tools. What we need now is the political will and public awareness to protect the programs that protect our wildlife—and, by extension, our water, air, food systems, and future.
From mussels in forested headwaters to bees in backyard gardens and salamanders under rotting logs, these species tell us when the world is working—and when it’s not. Their survival is our survival, too.
Let’s not lose the forest for the trees. Let’s not wait until it’s too late.
Let’s keep every cog and wheel.

By requiring these reports, Connecticut continues to lead the way in judicial nominations transparency and providing policymakers with the information they need to ensure that people’s champions have a path to the state bench. 

Steve Kennedy
Today, lawyers who have represented actual people rather than powerful entities, like corporations or the state, are much less likely to be tapped for judicial nominations than their corporate and prosecutorial peers. In a way, bias in judicial nominations is not a new problem. Until relatively recently, it was common for Connecticut governors to nominate slates of dozens of state court judges without any racial minorities and very few women. 
Now however, the gender ratio of state court judges is approximately equal to that of the population, and Connecticut has one of the most racially diverse benches in the nation. So what changed, and how can we apply the lessons of this turnaround to other shortcomings of the state judiciary? Commitments to diversity from governors and other stakeholders were important, but a key –and often overlooked– component was increasing the transparency of the judicial selection process.
While some portion of the increase in demographic diversity among judges may reflect a slight shift in that direction nationwide, law still remains one of the least diverse professions in the country. Rather, in Connecticut, the last two administrations have made explicit efforts to increase the demographic diversity of their judicial nominees, assisted by the strongest judicial selection demographics reporting requirements in the country.
Judicial applicant confidentiality is important, but not long after forming the JSC to screen judicial applicants for selection by the governor, the General Assembly recognized that without some kind of window into the JSC’s decisions, there would be significant opportunity for bias to prevent candidates from certain backgrounds from making it through the system.
Now, every year, the JSC is required to report anonymized demographic data on judicial applicants, including race, gender, religion, and time in legal practice. In addition to providing these data for applicants, the Commission must also report the same for approved applicants. Seeing an overwhelming white and male bench in the 1980s, the legislature set up a system where comparing the demographics of these two groups can identify whether a lack of diversity is due to a lack of diversity in applicants or if there is a systemic issue keeping them from passing through the JSC.
This system is not perfect, and significant effort is still needed to increase the transparency of the selection process and allow for greater public participation, but the JSC’s reporting requirements have allowed the government and advocates to analyze its work and address systemic issues. Today, further transparency is needed–not around demographic but professional diversity. 
Connecticut’s bench is currently dominated by former prosecutors and corporate attorneys. Empirical studies, including one of the Connecticut judiciary, have found that these are the very backgrounds that more often side with powerful entities like corporations and the state over ordinary people. From housing court to discrimination claims to criminal sentencing, people facing off against a corporation or the state are significantly more likely to lose their cases if they appear before a former prosecutor or corporate attorney.
Unlike former prosecutors and corporate attorneys, public interest attorneys with backgrounds representing the people rather than the powerful are significantly underrepresented among Connecticut judges. While there has been some improvement on this front over the last two years, encouraged particularly by the CT Pro-People Judiciary Coalition, public interest attorneys like public defenders, legal aid, civil rights, and labor lawyers remain a small minority on the state bench. For example, the Connecticut Supreme Court only has one justice who regularly represented people before becoming a judge (and he is the justice who sides most often with people compared with his peers who side more often with their own former corporate and state employers). Aside from the short-term appointment of Justice Christine Keller, who spent part of her career in legal aid, all of Gov. Ned Lamont’s high court nominees have had corporate and/or prosecutorial backgrounds.
So what is the cause of this problem? According to the Governor’s Office, the main reason is that not enough public interest lawyers apply to be judges in the first place. This may be true to at least some extent, but the Pro-People Judiciary Coalition is aware of a number of public interest attorneys who have been on the approved candidate list for years without being nominated. Other public interest attorneys report being accused by some JSC members of a lack of objectivity because of their chosen fields. To address these discrepancies and help determine effective methods of increasing the representation of lawyers for the people on the bench, the coalition proposed a simple addition to the JSC’s reporting requirements: the professional backgrounds of all applicants and approved candidates.
This proposal was included in this session’s H.B. 7041, which contained several other changes to the JSC, some of which we supported and some we did not. But the JSC reporting amendment included in H.B. 7041 represents a modest but meaningful step toward a judiciary that better reflects the full range of legal experience in Connecticut—and, by extension, improves the outcomes for ordinary people appearing in our courts.
Just as demographic transparency helped open the door for more diverse candidates to reach the bench, transparency around professional background can ensure that those who have spent their careers representing everyday people, not just the powerful, are given a fair shot. This bill will not only strengthen public confidence in the judicial system but also affirm Connecticut’s commitment to a fairer, more inclusive judiciary.
Connecticut is leading the way on a more open judicial selection process, and all states with judicial nominations should take a close look at following Connecticut’s lead.

(Getty Images)The Louisiana Public Defender Oversight Board voted 5-4 Monday to uphold the ousting of five attorneys who lead local public defender offices. The decision follows the replacement of more than half of the board’s members over the past six weeks.
The vote means the attorneys won’t be returning to their jobs anytime soon, but it won’t end their dispute with Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration. 
“This wasn’t so much the board’s decision as it was the governor’s decision in my opinion,” Rick Schroeder, a New Orleans area lawyer representing the dismissed attorneys, said in an interview. 
The ousted attorneys appear to be gearing up to sue the Landry administration and their former boss, State Public Defender Rémy Starns. 
Starns became state public defender in 2020 when former Gov. John Bel Edwards in office and was reappointed last year by Landry. The lawyers allege he took away their jobs because they spoke out against him in front of the public defender board and state lawmakers. They’ve also accused him of targeting women for retribution. 
They include Michelle AndrePont of Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson of Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller of Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who worked in Madison, Tensas and East Carroll parishes. 
“I’ve opposed every one of his efforts to seize power because I believe in independence, accountability and justice,” AndrePont told the board Monday. “I have lost my job, but I will not lose my voice, and I will not lose my integrity.” 
In June, Starns denied allegations of gender discrimination, though he hasn’t offered an explanation as to why he dismissed the attorneys. He has said he is not legally required to share his reasons for not renewing the attorneys’ annual contracts, which expired July 1. 
None of the terminated lawyers received negative performance reviews or problematic office audits while in their jobs. It is rare for chief public defenders contracts to not be renewed.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jean Faria, who was state public defender from 2008-13 and continued to work with the office through 2020, testified Monday before the board. During her time with the agency, no lead local public defenders had their contract renewals rejected without cause, she said.    
For weeks, Starns’ decision to remove the attorneys has given rise to consternation within the public defender board. Six of its nine members have resigned since the end of May, as the board’s vote over whether to intervene in the dismissals became unavoidable. 
The board was forced to reschedule its vote on the terminations three times in the past three weeks. Until Monday, not enough board members were showing up to legally take a vote. 
The five members who voted to uphold Starns’ decision to fire the attorneys have only joined the board in the last month. Three had never attended a board meeting before Monday, and the other two had only been to one previous meeting on June 16. 
The four board members who voted against Starns’ decision have been with the board for over a year. 
Starns didn’t attend the board meeting in person Monday, even though he was out in the hallway yards away from the meeting room entrance as it convened. When the board members took a recess, Starns walked by and looked through a door window into the meeting room but didn’t enter. 
When a reporter asked him in the hallway why he wasn’t attending meeting, Starns said he was watching it remotely. 

As a result of the recent board resignations, its makeup changed. A few weeks ago, the board included three Black members. Now, eight of its nine members are white, though a third of Louisiana’s population is Black and many of the people who rely on public defense in the court system are not white. 

Its only Black member, Baton Rouge attorney Adrejia Boutte, was one of three nominees submitted to Landry for selection last year by the public defender board and state criminal defense attorney association. She had also served on a previous public defender board during the Edwards administration.
The board also went from having five retired state judges as members, to just three.
Its newest members include:
